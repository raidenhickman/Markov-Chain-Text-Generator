11 in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth 12 and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters 13 and god said let there be light and there was light 14 and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness 15 and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day 16 and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters 17 and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so 18 and god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the morning were the second day 19 and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so 110 and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the waters called he seas and god saw that it was good 111 and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so 112 and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good 113 and the evening and the morning were the third day 114 and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years 115 and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so 116 and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also 117 and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth 118 and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good 119 and the evening and the morning were the fourth day 120 and god said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven 121 and god created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was good 122 and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth 123 and the evening and the morning were the fifth day 124 and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so 125 and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good 126 and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth 127 so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them 128 and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth 129 and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat 130 and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life i have given every green herb for meat and it was so 131 and god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day 21 thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them 22 and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made 23 and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made 24 these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens 25 and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground 26 but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground 27 and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul 28 and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed 29 and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil 210 and a river went out of eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became into four heads 211 the name of the first is pison that is it which compasseth the whole land of havilah where there is gold 212 and the gold of that land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone 213 and the name of the second river is gihon the same is it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia 214 and the name of the third river is hiddekel that is it which goeth toward the east of assyria and the fourth river is euphrates 215 and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it 216 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat 217 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die 218 and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him an help meet for him 219 and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof 220 and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found an help meet for him 221 and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof 222 and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man 223 and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man 224 therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh 225 and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed 31 now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden 32 and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden 33 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die 34 and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die 35 for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil 36 and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat 37 and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons 38 and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden 39 and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou 310 and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself 311 and he said who told thee that thou wast naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat 312 and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat 313 and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat 314 and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life 315 and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel 316 unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee 317 and unto adam he said because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life 318 thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field 319 in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return 320 and adam called his wifes name eve because she was the mother of all living 321 unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothed them 322 and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever 323 therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken 324 so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life 41 and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord 42 and she again bare his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground 43 and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord 44 and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering 45 but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell 46 and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen 47 if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him 48 and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him 49 and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brothers keeper 410 and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto me from the ground 411 and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand 412 when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth 413 and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear 414 behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me 415 and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him 416 and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden 417 and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch 418 and unto enoch was born irad and irad begat mehujael and mehujael begat methusael and methusael begat lamech 419 and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was adah and the name of the other zillah 420 and adah bare jabal he was the father of such as dwell in tents and of such as have cattle 421 and his brothers name was jubal he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ 422 and zillah she also bare tubalcain an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron and the sister of tubalcain was naamah 423 and lamech said unto his wives adah and zillah hear my voice ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt 424 if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy and sevenfold 425 and adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name seth for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew 426 and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord 51 this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man in the likeness of god made he him 52 male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created 53 and adam lived an hundred and thirty years and begat a son in his own likeness and after his image and called his name seth 54 and the days of adam after he had begotten seth were eight hundred years and he begat sons and daughters 55 and all the days that adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years and he died 56 and seth lived an hundred and five years and begat enos 57 and seth lived after he begat enos eight hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters 58 and all the days of seth were nine hundred and twelve years and he died 59 and enos lived ninety years and begat cainan 510 and enos lived after he begat cainan eight hundred and fifteen years and begat sons and daughters 511 and all the days of enos were nine hundred and five years and he died 512 and cainan lived seventy years and begat mahalaleel 513 and cainan lived after he begat mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years and begat sons and daughters 514 and all the days of cainan were nine hundred and ten years and he died 515 and mahalaleel lived sixty and five years and begat jared 516 and mahalaleel lived after he begat jared eight hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters 517 and all the days of mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years and he died 518 and jared lived an hundred sixty and two years and he begat enoch 519 and jared lived after he begat enoch eight hundred years and begat sons and daughters 520 and all the days of jared were nine hundred sixty and two years and he died 521 and enoch lived sixty and five years and begat methuselah 522 and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughters 523 and all the days of enoch were three hundred sixty and five years 524 and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him 525 and methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years and begat lamech 526 and methuselah lived after he begat lamech seven hundred eighty and two years and begat sons and daughters 527 and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died 528 and lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years and begat a son 529 and he called his name noah saying this same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground which the lord hath cursed 530 and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five years and begat sons and daughters 531 and all the days of lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years and he died 532 and noah was five hundred years old and noah begat shem ham and japheth 61 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them 62 that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose 63 and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years 64 there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown 65 and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually 66 and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart 67 and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them 68 but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord 69 these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah walked with god 610 and noah begat three sons shem ham and japheth 611 the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence 612 and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth 613 and god said unto noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth 614 make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch 615 and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits the breadth of it fifty cubits and the height of it thirty cubits 616 a window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it 617 and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven and every thing that is in the earth shall die 618 but with thee will i establish my covenant and thou shalt come into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wives with thee 619 and of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be male and female 620 of fowls after their kind and of cattle after their kind of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive 621 and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them 622 thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did he 71 and the lord said unto noah come thou and all thy house into the ark for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation 72 of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and his female 73 of fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth 74 for yet seven days and i will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights and every living substance that i have made will i destroy from off the face of the earth 75 and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him 76 and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth 77 and noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood 78 of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth 79 there went in two and two unto noah into the ark the male and the female as god had commanded noah 710 and it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth 711 in the six hundredth year of noahs life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened 712 and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights 713 in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth the sons of noah and noahs wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark 714 they and every beast after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind every bird of every sort 715 and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life 716 and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as god had commanded him and the lord shut him in 717 and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth 718 and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters 719 and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered 720 fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were covered 721 and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl and of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and every man 722 all in whose nostrils was the breath of life of all that was in the dry land died 723 and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark 724 and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days 81 and god remembered noah and every living thing and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters asswaged 82 the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained 83 and the waters returned from off the earth continually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated 84 and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of ararat 85 and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seen 86 and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made 87 and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth 88 also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground 89 but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark 810 and he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark 811 and the dove came in to him in the evening and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth 812 and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove which returned not again unto him any more 813 and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dry 814 and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth dried 815 and god spake unto noah saying 816 go forth of the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee 817 bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth 818 and noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him 819 every beast every creeping thing and every fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the ark 820 and noah builded an altar unto the lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar 821 and the lord smelled a sweet savour and the lord said in his heart i will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake for the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth neither will i again smite any more every thing living as i have done 822 while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease 91 and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth 92 and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered 93 every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb have i given you all things 94 but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat 95 and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of man at the hand of every mans brother will i require the life of man 96 whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man 97 and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein 98 and god spake unto noah and to his sons with him saying 99 and i behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you 910 and with every living creature that is with you of the fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth 911 and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth 912 and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations 913 i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth 914 and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud 915 and i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh 916 and the bow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth 917 and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant which i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth 918 and the sons of noah that went forth of the ark were shem and ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan 919 these are the three sons of noah and of them was the whole earth overspread 920 and noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a vineyard 921 and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent 922 and ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren without 923 and shem and japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their fathers nakedness 924 and noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him 925 and he said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren 926 and he said blessed be the lord god of shem and canaan shall be his servant 927 god shall enlarge japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of shem and canaan shall be his servant 928 and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years 929 and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years and he died 101 now these are the generations of the sons of noah shem ham and japheth and unto them were sons born after the flood 102 the sons of japheth gomer and magog and madai and javan and tubal and meshech and tiras 103 and the sons of gomer ashkenaz and riphath and togarmah 104 and the sons of javan elishah and tarshish kittim and dodanim 105 by these were the isles of the gentiles divided in their lands every one after his tongue after their families in their nations 106 and the sons of ham cush and mizraim and phut and canaan 107 and the sons of cush seba and havilah and sabtah and raamah and sabtechah and the sons of raamah sheba and dedan 108 and cush begat nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth 109 he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord 1010 and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and erech and accad and calneh in the land of shinar 1011 out of that land went forth asshur and builded nineveh and the city rehoboth and calah 1012 and resen between nineveh and calah the same is a great city 1013 and mizraim begat ludim and anamim and lehabim and naphtuhim 1014 and pathrusim and casluhim out of whom came philistim and caphtorim 1015 and canaan begat sidon his first born and heth 1016 and the jebusite and the amorite and the girgasite 1017 and the hivite and the arkite and the sinite 1018 and the arvadite and the zemarite and the hamathite and afterward were the families of the canaanites spread abroad 1019 and the border of the canaanites was from sidon as thou comest to gerar unto gaza as thou goest unto sodom and gomorrah and admah and zeboim even unto lasha 1020 these are the sons of ham after their families after their tongues in their countries and in their nations 1021 unto shem also the father of all the children of eber the brother of japheth the elder even to him were children born 1022 the children of shem elam and asshur and arphaxad and lud and aram 1023 and the children of aram uz and hul and gether and mash 1024 and arphaxad begat salah and salah begat eber 1025 and unto eber were born two sons the name of one was peleg for in his days was the earth divided and his brothers name was joktan 1026 and joktan begat almodad and sheleph and hazarmaveth and jerah 1027 and hadoram and uzal and diklah 1028 and obal and abimael and sheba 1029 and ophir and havilah and jobab all these were the sons of joktan 1030 and their dwelling was from mesha as thou goest unto sephar a mount of the east 1031 these are the sons of shem after their families after their tongues in their lands after their nations 1032 these are the families of the sons of noah after their generations in their nations and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood 111 and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech 112 and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there 113 and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for morter 114 and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth 115 and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded 116 and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do 117 go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one anothers speech 118 so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city 119 therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth 1110 these are the generations of shem shem was an hundred years old and begat arphaxad two years after the flood 1111 and shem lived after he begat arphaxad five hundred years and begat sons and daughters 1112 and arphaxad lived five and thirty years and begat salah 1113 and arphaxad lived after he begat salah four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters 1114 and salah lived thirty years and begat eber 1115 and salah lived after he begat eber four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters 1116 and eber lived four and thirty years and begat peleg 1117 and eber lived after he begat peleg four hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters 1118 and peleg lived thirty years and begat reu 1119 and peleg lived after he begat reu two hundred and nine years and begat sons and daughters 1120 and reu lived two and thirty years and begat serug 1121 and reu lived after he begat serug two hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters 1122 and serug lived thirty years and begat nahor 1123 and serug lived after he begat nahor two hundred years and begat sons and daughters 1124 and nahor lived nine and twenty years and begat terah 1125 and nahor lived after he begat terah an hundred and nineteen years and begat sons and daughters 1126 and terah lived seventy years and begat abram nahor and haran 1127 now these are the generations of terah terah begat abram nahor and haran and haran begat lot 1128 and haran died before his father terah in the land of his nativity in ur of the chaldees 1129 and abram and nahor took them wives the name of abrams wife was sarai and the name of nahors wife milcah the daughter of haran the father of milcah and the father of iscah 1130 but sarai was barren she had no child 1131 and terah took abram his son and lot the son of haran his sons son and sarai his daughter in law his son abrams wife and they went forth with them from ur of the chaldees to go into the land of canaan and they came unto haran and dwelt there 1132 and the days of terah were two hundred and five years and terah died in haran 121 now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy fathers house unto a land that i will shew thee 122 and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing 123 and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed 124 so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of haran 125 and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brothers son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of canaan and into the land of canaan they came 126 and abram passed through the land unto the place of sichem unto the plain of moreh and the canaanite was then in the land 127 and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land and there builded he an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him 128 and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel and pitched his tent having bethel on the west and hai on the east and there he builded an altar unto the lord and called upon the name of the lord 129 and abram journeyed going on still toward the south 1210 and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into egypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the land 1211 and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt that he said unto sarai his wife behold now i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon 1212 therefore it shall come to pass when the egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee alive 1213 say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee 1214 and it came to pass that when abram was come into egypt the egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair 1215 the princes also of pharaoh saw her and commended her before pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaohs house 1216 and he entreated abram well for her sake and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses and camels 1217 and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai abrams wife 1218 and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou hast done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife 1219 why saidst thou she is my sister so i might have taken her to me to wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way 1220 and pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all that he had 131 and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south 132 and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold 133 and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and hai 134 unto the place of the altar which he had make there at the first and there abram called on the name of the lord 135 and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents 136 and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together 137 and there was a strife between the herdmen of abrams cattle and the herdmen of lots cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land 138 and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethren 139 is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left 1310 and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan that it was well watered every where before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest unto zoar 1311 then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other 1312 abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward sodom 1313 but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly 1314 and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward 1315 for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed for ever 1316 and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered 1317 arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for i will give it unto thee 1318 then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of mamre which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord 141 and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of nations 142 that these made war with bera king of sodom and with birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of bela which is zoar 143 all these were joined together in the vale of siddim which is the salt sea 144 twelve years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year they rebelled 145 and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him and smote the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim and the zuzims in ham and the emins in shaveh kiriathaim 146 and the horites in their mount seir unto elparan which is by the wilderness 147 and they returned and came to enmishpat which is kadesh and smote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that dwelt in hazezontamar 148 and there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela the same is zoar and they joined battle with them in the vale of siddim 149 with chedorlaomer the king of elam and with tidal king of nations and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings with five 1410 and the vale of siddim was full of slimepits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled to the mountain 1411 and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their victuals and went their way 1412 and they took lot abrams brothers son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed 1413 and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and brother of aner and these were confederate with abram 1414 and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house three hundred and eighteen and pursued them unto dan 1415 and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the left hand of damascus 1416 and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people 1417 and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him at the valley of shaveh which is the kings dale 1418 and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god 1419 and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth 1420 and blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all 1421 and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself 1422 and abram said to the king of sodom i have lift up mine hand unto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth 1423 that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet and that i will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest say i have made abram rich 1424 save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcol and mamre let them take their portion 151 after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward 152 and abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus 153 and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir 154 and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir 155 and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be 156 and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness 157 and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it 158 and he said lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it 159 and he said unto him take me an heifer of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtledove and a young pigeon 1510 and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not 1511 and when the fowls came down upon the carcases abram drove them away 1512 and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him 1513 and he said unto abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years 1514 and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance 1515 and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age 1516 but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full 1517 and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces 1518 in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the great river the river euphrates 1519 the kenites and the kenizzites and the kadmonites 1520 and the hittites and the perizzites and the rephaims 1521 and the amorites and the canaanites and the girgashites and the jebusites 161 now sarai abrams wife bare him no children and she had an handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar 162 and sarai said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may obtain children by her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai 163 and sarai abrams wife took hagar her maid the egyptian after abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to her husband abram to be his wife 164 and he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes 165 and sarai said unto abram my wrong be upon thee i have given my maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes the lord judge between me and thee 166 but abram said unto sarai behold thy maid is in thine hand do to her as it pleaseth thee and when sarai dealt hardly with her she fled from her face 167 and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur 168 and he said hagar sarais maid whence camest thou and whither wilt thou go and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai 169 and the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands 1610 and the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude 1611 and the angel of the lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name ishmael because the lord hath heard thy affliction 1612 and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren 1613 and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her thou god seest me for she said have i also here looked after him that seeth me 1614 wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi behold it is between kadesh and bered 1615 and hagar bare abram a son and abram called his sons name which hagar bare ishmael 1616 and abram was fourscore and six years old when hagar bare ishmael to abram 171 and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect 172 and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly 173 and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying 174 as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations 175 neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee 176 and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee 177 and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee 178 and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god 179 and god said unto abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations 1710 this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised 1711 and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you 1712 and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed 1713 he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant 1714 and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant 1715 and god said unto abraham as for sarai thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be 1716 and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of people shall be of her 1717 then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old and shall sarah that is ninety years old bear 1718 and abraham said unto god o that ishmael might live before thee 1719 and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him 1720 and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation 1721 but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year 1722 and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham 1723 and abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money every male among the men of abrahams house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day as god had said unto him 1724 and abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin 1725 and ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin 1726 in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised and ishmael his son 1727 and all the men of his house born in the house and bought with money of the stranger were circumcised with him 181 and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamre and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day 182 and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground 183 and said my lord if now i have found favour in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant 184 let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree 185 and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant and they said so do as thou hast said 186 and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the hearth 187 and abraham ran unto the herd and fetcht a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man and he hasted to dress it 188 and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat 189 and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent 1810 and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him 1811 now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women 1812 therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also 1813 and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of a surety bear a child which am old 1814 is any thing too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son 1815 then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh 1816 and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way 1817 and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do 1818 seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him 1819 for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him 1820 and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous 1821 i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know 1822 and the men turned their faces from thence and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord 1823 and abraham drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked 1824 peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein 1825 that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right 1826 and the lord said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city then i will spare all the place for their sakes 1827 and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord which am but dust and ashes 1828 peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five and he said if i find there forty and five i will not destroy it 1829 and he spake unto him yet again and said peradventure there shall be forty found there and he said i will not do it for fortys sake 1830 and he said unto him oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak peradventure there shall thirty be found there and he said i will not do it if i find thirty there 1831 and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord peradventure there shall be twenty found there and he said i will not destroy it for twentys sake 1832 and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once peradventure ten shall be found there and he said i will not destroy it for tens sake 1833 and the lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with abraham and abraham returned unto his place 191 and there came two angels to sodom at even and lot sat in the gate of sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground 192 and he said behold now my lords turn in i pray you into your servants house and tarry all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on your ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street all night 193 and he pressed upon them greatly and they turned in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat 194 but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of sodom compassed the house round both old and young all the people from every quarter 195 and they called unto lot and said unto him where are the men which came in to thee this night bring them out unto us that we may know them 196 and lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after him 197 and said i pray you brethren do not so wickedly 198 behold now i have two daughters which have not known man let me i pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good in your eyes only unto these men do nothing for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof 199 and they said stand back and they said again this one fellow came in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge now will we deal worse with thee than with them and they pressed sore upon the man even lot and came near to break the door 1910 but the men put forth their hand and pulled lot into the house to them and shut to the door 1911 and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door 1912 and the men said unto lot hast thou here any besides son in law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou hast in the city bring them out of this place 1913 for we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the lord and the lord hath sent us to destroy it 1914 and lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which married his daughters and said up get you out of this place for the lord will destroy this city but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law 1915 and when the morning arose then the angels hastened lot saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city 1916 and while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city 1917 and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed 1918 and lot said unto them oh not so my lord 1919 behold now thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life and i cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and i die 1920 behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one oh let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shall live 1921 and he said unto him see i have accepted thee concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow this city for the which thou hast spoken 1922 haste thee escape thither for i cannot do anything till thou be come thither therefore the name of the city was called zoar 1923 the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar 1924 then the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven 1925 and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground 1926 but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt 1927 and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the lord 1928 and he looked toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace 1929 and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt 1930 and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters 1931 and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth 1932 come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father 1933 and they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose 1934 and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger behold i lay yesternight with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father 1935 and they made their father drink wine that night also and the younger arose and lay with him and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose 1936 thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father 1937 and the first born bare a son and called his name moab the same is the father of the moabites unto this day 1938 and the younger she also bare a son and called his name benammi the same is the father of the children of ammon unto this day 201 and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and dwelled between kadesh and shur and sojourned in gerar 202 and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah 203 but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken for she is a mans wife 204 but abimelech had not come near her and he said lord wilt thou slay also a righteous nation 205 said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this 206 and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered i thee not to touch her 207 now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine 208 therefore abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were sore afraid 209 then abimelech called abraham and said unto him what hast thou done unto us and what have i offended thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done 2010 and abimelech said unto abraham what sawest thou that thou hast done this thing 2011 and abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for my wifes sake 2012 and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife 2013 and it came to pass when god caused me to wander from my fathers house that i said unto her this is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me at every place whither we shall come say of me he is my brother 2014 and abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and womenservants and gave them unto abraham and restored him sarah his wife 2015 and abimelech said behold my land is before thee dwell where it pleaseth thee 2016 and unto sarah he said behold i have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that are with thee and with all other thus she was reproved 2017 so abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidservants and they bare children 2018 for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abrahams wife 211 and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken 212 for sarah conceived and bare abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him 213 and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bare to him isaac 214 and abraham circumcised his son isaac being eight days old as god had commanded him 215 and abraham was an hundred years old when his son isaac was born unto him 216 and sarah said god hath made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me 217 and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should have given children suck for i have born him a son in his old age 218 and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great feast the same day that isaac was weaned 219 and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian which she had born unto abraham mocking 2110 wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with isaac 2111 and the thing was very grievous in abrahams sight because of his son 2112 and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall thy seed be called 2113 and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation because he is thy seed 2114 and abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba 2115 and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child under one of the shrubs 2116 and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of the child and she sat over against him and lift up her voice and wept 2117 and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called to hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee hagar fear not for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is 2118 arise lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand for i will make him a great nation 2119 and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink 2120 and god was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer 2121 and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt 2122 and it came to pass at that time that abimelech and phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto abraham saying god is with thee in all that thou doest 2123 now therefore swear unto me here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my sons son but according to the kindness that i have done unto thee thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned 2124 and abraham said i will swear 2125 and abraham reproved abimelech because of a well of water which abimelechs servants had violently taken away 2126 and abimelech said i wot not who hath done this thing neither didst thou tell me neither yet heard i of it but to day 2127 and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto abimelech and both of them made a covenant 2128 and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves 2129 and abimelech said unto abraham what mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves 2130 and he said for these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness unto me that i have digged this well 2131 wherefore he called that place beersheba because there they sware both of them 2132 thus they made a covenant at beersheba then abimelech rose up and phichol the chief captain of his host and they returned into the land of the philistines 2133 and abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god 2134 and abraham sojourned in the philistines land many days 221 and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am 222 and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of 223 and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had told him 224 then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off 225 and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you 226 and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together 227 and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering 228 and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together 229 and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood 2210 and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son 2211 and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i 2212 and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou any thing unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me 2213 and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son 2214 and abraham called the name of that place jehovahjireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen 2215 and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time 2216 and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son 2217 that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies 2218 and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice 2219 so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba 2220 and it came to pass after these things that it was told abraham saying behold milcah she hath also born children unto thy brother nahor 2221 huz his firstborn and buz his brother and kemuel the father of aram 2222 and chesed and hazo and pildash and jidlaph and bethuel 2223 and bethuel begat rebekah these eight milcah did bear to nahor abrahams brother 2224 and his concubine whose name was reumah she bare also tebah and gaham and thahash and maachah 231 and sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old these were the years of the life of sarah 232 and sarah died in kirjatharba the same is hebron in the land of canaan and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her 233 and abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto the sons of heth saying 234 i am a stranger and a sojourner with you give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that i may bury my dead out of my sight 235 and the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him 236 hear us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead 237 and abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of heth 238 and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and intreat for me to ephron the son of zohar 239 that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you 2310 and ephron dwelt among the children of heth and ephron the hittite answered abraham in the audience of the children of heth even of all that went in at the gate of his city saying 2311 nay my lord hear me the field give i thee and the cave that is therein i give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people give i it thee bury thy dead 2312 and abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land 2313 and he spake unto ephron in the audience of the people of the land saying but if thou wilt give it i pray thee hear me i will give thee money for the field take it of me and i will bury my dead there 2314 and ephron answered abraham saying unto him 2315 my lord hearken unto me the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver what is that betwixt me and thee bury therefore thy dead 2316 and abraham hearkened unto ephron and abraham weighed to ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of heth four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchant 2317 and the field of ephron which was in machpelah which was before mamre the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees that were in the field that were in all the borders round about were made sure 2318 unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth before all that went in at the gate of his city 2319 and after this abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre the same is hebron in the land of canaan 2320 and the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of heth 241 and abraham was old and well stricken in age and the lord had blessed abraham in all things 242 and abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh 243 and i will make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell 244 but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son isaac 245 and the servant said unto him peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must i needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest 246 and abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again 247 the lord god of heaven which took me from my fathers house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that sware unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land he shall send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence 248 and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again 249 and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and sware to him concerning that matter 2410 and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to mesopotamia unto the city of nahor 2411 and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water 2412 and he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and shew kindness unto my master abraham 2413 behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water 2414 and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master 2415 and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebekah came out who was born to bethuel son of milcah the wife of nahor abrahams brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder 2416 and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up 2417 and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee drink a little water of thy pitcher 2418 and she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink 2419 and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking 2420 and she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camels 2421 and the man wondering at her held his peace to wit whether the lord had made his journey prosperous or not 2422 and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold 2423 and said whose daughter art thou tell me i pray thee is there room in thy fathers house for us to lodge in 2424 and she said unto him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah which she bare unto nahor 2425 she said moreover unto him we have both straw and provender enough and room to lodge in 2426 and the man bowed down his head and worshipped the lord 2427 and he said blessed be the lord god of my master abraham who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth i being in the way the lord led me to the house of my masters brethren 2428 and the damsel ran and told them of her mothers house these things 2429 and rebekah had a brother and his name was laban and laban ran out unto the man unto the well 2430 and it came to pass when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sisters hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister saying thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels at the well 2431 and he said come in thou blessed of the lord wherefore standest thou without for i have prepared the house and room for the camels 2432 and the man came into the house and he ungirded his camels and gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the mens feet that were with him 2433 and there was set meat before him to eat but he said i will not eat until i have told mine errand and he said speak on 2434 and he said i am abrahams servant 2435 and the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses 2436 and sarah my masters wife bare a son to my master when she was old and unto him hath he given all that he hath 2437 and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell 2438 but thou shalt go unto my fathers house and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son 2439 and i said unto my master peradventure the woman will not follow me 2440 and he said unto me the lord before whom i walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my fathers house 2441 then shalt thou be clear from this my oath when thou comest to my kindred and if they give not thee one thou shalt be clear from my oath 2442 and i came this day unto the well and said o lord god of my master abraham if now thou do prosper my way which i go 2443 behold i stand by the well of water and it shall come to pass that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water and i say to her give me i pray thee a little water of thy pitcher to drink 2444 and she say to me both drink thou and i will also draw for thy camels let the same be the woman whom the lord hath appointed out for my masters son 2445 and before i had done speaking in mine heart behold rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down unto the well and drew water and i said unto her let me drink i pray thee 2446 and she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said drink and i will give thy camels drink also so i drank and she made the camels drink also 2447 and i asked her and said whose daughter art thou and she said the daughter of bethuel nahors son whom milcah bare unto him and i put the earring upon her face and the bracelets upon her hands 2448 and i bowed down my head and worshipped the lord and blessed the lord god of my master abraham which had led me in the right way to take my masters brothers daughter unto his son 2449 and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me and if not tell me that i may turn to the right hand or to the left 2450 then laban and bethuel answered and said the thing proceedeth from the lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good 2451 behold rebekah is before thee take her and go and let her be thy masters sons wife as the lord hath spoken 2452 and it came to pass that when abrahams servant heard their words he worshipped the lord bowing himself to the earth 2453 and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and gave them to rebekah he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things 2454 and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said send me away unto my master 2455 and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at the least ten after that she shall go 2456 and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the lord hath prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master 2457 and they said we will call the damsel and enquire at her mouth 2458 and they called rebekah and said unto her wilt thou go with this man and she said i will go 2459 and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse and abrahams servant and his men 2460 and they blessed rebekah and said unto her thou art our sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them 2461 and rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took rebekah and went his way 2462 and isaac came from the way of the well lahairoi for he dwelt in the south country 2463 and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming 2464 and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel 2465 for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my master therefore she took a vail and covered herself 2466 and the servant told isaac all things that he had done 2467 and isaac brought her into his mother sarahs tent and took rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her and isaac was comforted after his mothers death 251 then again abraham took a wife and her name was keturah 252 and she bare him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and ishbak and shuah 253 and jokshan begat sheba and dedan and the sons of dedan were asshurim and letushim and leummim 254 and the sons of midian ephah and epher and hanoch and abidah and eldaah all these were the children of keturah 255 and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac 256 but unto the sons of the concubines which abraham had abraham gave gifts and sent them away from isaac his son while he yet lived eastward unto the east country 257 and these are the days of the years of abrahams life which he lived an hundred threescore and fifteen years 258 then abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people 259 and his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which is before mamre 2510 the field which abraham purchased of the sons of heth there was abraham buried and sarah his wife 2511 and it came to pass after the death of abraham that god blessed his son isaac and isaac dwelt by the well lahairoi 2512 now these are the generations of ishmael abrahams son whom hagar the egyptian sarahs handmaid bare unto abraham 2513 and these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their names according to their generations the firstborn of ishmael nebajoth and kedar and adbeel and mibsam 2514 and mishma and dumah and massa 2515 hadar and tema jetur naphish and kedemah 2516 these are the sons of ishmael and these are their names by their towns and by their castles twelve princes according to their nations 2517 and these are the years of the life of ishmael an hundred and thirty and seven years and he gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people 2518 and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt as thou goest toward assyria and he died in the presence of all his brethren 2519 and these are the generations of isaac abrahams son abraham begat isaac 2520 and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah to wife the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram the sister to laban the syrian 2521 and isaac intreated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord was intreated of him and rebekah his wife conceived 2522 and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am i thus and she went to enquire of the lord 2523 and the lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger 2524 and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb 2525 and the first came out red all over like an hairy garment and they called his name esau 2526 and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on esaus heel and his name was called jacob and isaac was threescore years old when she bare them 2527 and the boys grew and esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field and jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents 2528 and isaac loved esau because he did eat of his venison but rebekah loved jacob 2529 and jacob sod pottage and esau came from the field and he was faint 2530 and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee with that same red pottage for i am faint therefore was his name called edom 2531 and jacob said sell me this day thy birthright 2532 and esau said behold i am at the point to die and what profit shall this birthright do to me 2533 and jacob said swear to me this day and he sware unto him and he sold his birthright unto jacob 2534 then jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentiles and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way thus esau despised his birthright 261 and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that was in the days of abraham and isaac went unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar 262 and the lord appeared unto him and said go not down into egypt dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of 263 sojourn in this land and i will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee and unto thy seed i will give all these countries and i will perform the oath which i sware unto abraham thy father 264 and i will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed 265 because that abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws 266 and isaac dwelt in gerar 267 and the men of the place asked him of his wife and he said she is my sister for he feared to say she is my wife lest said he the men of the place should kill me for rebekah because she was fair to look upon 268 and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold isaac was sporting with rebekah his wife 269 and abimelech called isaac and said behold of a surety she is thy wife and how saidst thou she is my sister and isaac said unto him because i said lest i die for her 2610 and abimelech said what is this thou hast done unto us one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us 2611 and abimelech charged all his people saying he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death 2612 then isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year an hundredfold and the lord blessed him 2613 and the man waxed great and went forward and grew until he became very great 2614 for he had possession of flocks and possession of herds and great store of servants and the philistines envied him 2615 for all the wells which his fathers servants had digged in the days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth 2616 and abimelech said unto isaac go from us for thou art much mightier than we 2617 and isaac departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of gerar and dwelt there 2618 and isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them 2619 and isaacs servants digged in the valley and found there a well of springing water 2620 and the herdmen of gerar did strive with isaacs herdmen saying the water is ours and he called the name of the well esek because they strove with him 2621 and they digged another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitnah 2622 and he removed from thence and digged another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it rehoboth and he said for now the lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land 2623 and he went up from thence to beersheba 2624 and the lord appeared unto him the same night and said i am the god of abraham thy father fear not for i am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant abrahams sake 2625 and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the lord and pitched his tent there and there isaacs servants digged a well 2626 then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath one of his friends and phichol the chief captain of his army 2627 and isaac said unto them wherefore come ye to me seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you 2628 and they said we saw certainly that the lord was with thee and we said let there be now an oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make a covenant with thee 2629 that thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace thou art now the blessed of the lord 2630 and he made them a feast and they did eat and drink 2631 and they rose up betimes in the morning and sware one to another and isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace 2632 and it came to pass the same day that isaacs servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged and said unto him we have found water 2633 and he called it shebah therefore the name of the city is beersheba unto this day 2634 and esau was forty years old when he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and bashemath the daughter of elon the hittite 2635 which were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah 271 and it came to pass that when isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called esau his eldest son and said unto him my son and he said unto him behold here am i 272 and he said behold now i am old i know not the day of my death 273 now therefore take i pray thee thy weapons thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venison 274 and make me savoury meat such as i love and bring it to me that i may eat that my soul may bless thee before i die 275 and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son and esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it 276 and rebekah spake unto jacob her son saying behold i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother saying 277 bring me venison and make me savoury meat that i may eat and bless thee before the lord before my death 278 now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which i command thee 279 go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats and i will make them savoury meat for thy father such as he loveth 2710 and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death 2711 and jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man 2712 my father peradventure will feel me and i shall seem to him as a deceiver and i shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing 2713 and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son only obey my voice and go fetch me them 2714 and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made savoury meat such as his father loved 2715 and rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son esau which were with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son 2716 and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck 2717 and she gave the savoury meat and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob 2718 and he came unto his father and said my father and he said here am i who art thou my son 2719 and jacob said unto his father i am esau thy first born i have done according as thou badest me arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me 2720 and isaac said unto his son how is it that thou hast found it so quickly my son and he said because the lord thy god brought it to me 2721 and isaac said unto jacob come near i pray thee that i may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son esau or not 2722 and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau 2723 and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother esaus hands so he blessed him 2724 and he said art thou my very son esau and he said i am 2725 and he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my sons venison that my soul may bless thee and he brought it near to him and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank 2726 and his father isaac said unto him come near now and kiss me my son 2727 and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the lord hath blessed 2728 therefore god give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine 2729 let people serve thee and nations bow down to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy mothers sons bow down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be he that blesseth thee 2730 and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting 2731 and he also had made savoury meat and brought it unto his father and said unto his father let my father arise and eat of his sons venison that thy soul may bless me 2732 and isaac his father said unto him who art thou and he said i am thy son thy firstborn esau 2733 and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said who where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him yea and he shall be blessed 2734 and when esau heard the words of his father he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father bless me even me also o my father 2735 and he said thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken away thy blessing 2736 and he said is not he rightly named jacob for he hath supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and behold now he hath taken away my blessing and he said hast thou not reserved a blessing for me 2737 and isaac answered and said unto esau behold i have made him thy lord and all his brethren have i given to him for servants and with corn and wine have i sustained him and what shall i do now unto thee my son 2738 and esau said unto his father hast thou but one blessing my father bless me even me also o my father and esau lifted up his voice and wept 2739 and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above 2740 and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck 2741 and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him and esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand then will i slay my brother jacob 2742 and these words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah and she sent and called jacob her younger son and said unto him behold thy brother esau as touching thee doth comfort himself purposing to kill thee 2743 now therefore my son obey my voice arise flee thou to laban my brother to haran 2744 and tarry with him a few days until thy brothers fury turn away 2745 until thy brothers anger turn away from thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him then i will send and fetch thee from thence why should i be deprived also of you both in one day 2746 and rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth if jacob take a wife of the daughters of heth such as these which are of the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me 281 and isaac called jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan 282 arise go to padanaram to the house of bethuel thy mothers father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of laban thy mothers brother 283 and god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou mayest be a multitude of people 284 and give thee the blessing of abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which god gave unto abraham 285 and isaac sent away jacob and he went to padanaram unto laban son of bethuel the syrian the brother of rebekah jacobs and esaus mother 286 when esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to padanaram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge saying thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of canaan 287 and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to padanaram 288 and esau seeing that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father 289 then went esau unto ishmael and took unto the wives which he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael abrahams son the sister of nebajoth to be his wife 2810 and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran 2811 and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep 2812 and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it 2813 and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed 2814 and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed 2815 and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of 2816 and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not 2817 and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven 2818 and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it 2819 and he called the name of that place bethel but the name of that city was called luz at the first 2820 and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on 2821 so that i come again to my fathers house in peace then shall the lord be my god 2822 and this stone which i have set for a pillar shall be gods house and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee 291 then jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the east 292 and he looked and behold a well in the field and lo there were three flocks of sheep lying by it for out of that well they watered the flocks and a great stone was upon the wells mouth 293 and thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone again upon the wells mouth in his place 294 and jacob said unto them my brethren whence be ye and they said of haran are we 295 and he said unto them know ye laban the son of nahor and they said we know him 296 and he said unto them is he well and they said he is well and behold rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep 297 and he said lo it is yet high day neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep and go and feed them 298 and they said we cannot until all the flocks be gathered together and till they roll the stone from the wells mouth then we water the sheep 299 and while he yet spake with them rachel came with her fathers sheep for she kept them 2910 and it came to pass when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mothers brother and the sheep of laban his mothers brother that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the flock of laban his mothers brother 2911 and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept 2912 and jacob told rachel that he was her fathers brother and that he was rebekahs son and she ran and told her father 2913 and it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob his sisters son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house and he told laban all these things 2914 and laban said to him surely thou art my bone and my flesh and he abode with him the space of a month 2915 and laban said unto jacob because thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thy wages be 2916 and laban had two daughters the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel 2917 leah was tender eyed but rachel was beautiful and well favoured 2918 and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter 2919 and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than that i should give her to another man abide with me 2920 and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her 2921 and jacob said unto laban give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that i may go in unto her 2922 and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast 2923 and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her 2924 and laban gave unto his daughter leah zilpah his maid for an handmaid 2925 and it came to pass that in the morning behold it was leah and he said to laban what is this thou hast done unto me did not i serve with thee for rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled me 2926 and laban said it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn 2927 fulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years 2928 and jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife also 2929 and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her maid 2930 and he went in also unto rachel and he loved also rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years 2931 and when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened her womb but rachel was barren 2932 and leah conceived and bare a son and she called his name reuben for she said surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love me 2933 and she conceived again and bare a son and said because the lord hath heard i was hated he hath therefore given me this son also and she called his name simeon 2934 and she conceived again and bare a son and said now this time will my husband be joined unto me because i have born him three sons therefore was his name called levi 2935 and she conceived again and bare a son and she said now will i praise the lord therefore she called his name judah and left bearing 301 and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children rachel envied her sister and said unto jacob give me children or else i die 302 and jacobs anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i in gods stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb 303 and she said behold my maid bilhah go in unto her and she shall bear upon my knees that i may also have children by her 304 and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife and jacob went in unto her 305 and bilhah conceived and bare jacob a son 306 and rachel said god hath judged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son therefore called she his name dan 307 and bilhah rachels maid conceived again and bare jacob a second son 308 and rachel said with great wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and i have prevailed and she called his name naphtali 309 when leah saw that she had left bearing she took zilpah her maid and gave her jacob to wife 3010 and zilpah leahs maid bare jacob a son 3011 and leah said a troop cometh and she called his name gad 3012 and zilpah leahs maid bare jacob a second son 3013 and leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me blessed and she called his name asher 3014 and reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother leah then rachel said to leah give me i pray thee of thy sons mandrakes 3015 and she said unto her is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband and wouldest thou take away my sons mandrakes also and rachel said therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy sons mandrakes 3016 and jacob came out of the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said thou must come in unto me for surely i have hired thee with my sons mandrakes and he lay with her that night 3017 and god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bare jacob the fifth son 3018 and leah said god hath given me my hire because i have given my maiden to my husband and she called his name issachar 3019 and leah conceived again and bare jacob the sixth son 3020 and leah said god hath endued me with a good dowry now will my husband dwell with me because i have born him six sons and she called his name zebulun 3021 and afterwards she bare a daughter and called her name dinah 3022 and god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened her womb 3023 and she conceived and bare a son and said god hath taken away my reproach 3024 and she called his name joseph and said the lord shall add to me another son 3025 and it came to pass when rachel had born joseph that jacob said unto laban send me away that i may go unto mine own place and to my country 3026 give me my wives and my children for whom i have served thee and let me go for thou knowest my service which i have done thee 3027 and laban said unto him i pray thee if i have found favour in thine eyes tarry for i have learned by experience that the lord hath blessed me for thy sake 3028 and he said appoint me thy wages and i will give it 3029 and he said unto him thou knowest how i have served thee and how thy cattle was with me 3030 for it was little which thou hadst before i came and it is now increased unto a multitude and the lord hath blessed thee since my coming and now when shall i provide for mine own house also 3031 and he said what shall i give thee and jacob said thou shalt not give me any thing if thou wilt do this thing for me i will again feed and keep thy flock 3032 i will pass through all thy flock to day removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such shall be my hire 3033 so shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come when it shall come for my hire before thy face every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and brown among the sheep that shall be counted stolen with me 3034 and laban said behold i would it might be according to thy word 3035 and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted and every one that had some white in it and all the brown among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons 3036 and he set three days journey betwixt himself and jacob and jacob fed the rest of labans flocks 3037 and jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel and chesnut tree and pilled white strakes in them and made the white appear which was in the rods 3038 and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink that they should conceive when they came to drink 3039 and the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forth cattle ringstraked speckled and spotted 3040 and jacob did separate the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked and all the brown in the flock of laban and he put his own flocks by themselves and put them not unto labans cattle 3041 and it came to pass whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods 3042 but when the cattle were feeble he put them not in so the feebler were labans and the stronger jacobs 3043 and the man increased exceedingly and had much cattle and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses 311 and he heard the words of labans sons saying jacob hath taken away all that was our fathers and of that which was our fathers hath he gotten all this glory 312 and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it was not toward him as before 313 and the lord said unto jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee 314 and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock 315 and said unto them i see your fathers countenance that it is not toward me as before but the god of my father hath been with me 316 and ye know that with all my power i have served your father 317 and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times but god suffered him not to hurt me 318 if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the cattle bare speckled and if he said thus the ringstraked shall be thy hire then bare all the cattle ringstraked 319 thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father and given them to me 3110 and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived that i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked speckled and grisled 3111 and the angel of god spake unto me in a dream saying jacob and i said here am i 3112 and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked speckled and grisled for i have seen all that laban doeth unto thee 3113 i am the god of bethel where thou anointedst the pillar and where thou vowedst a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred 3114 and rachel and leah answered and said unto him is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house 3115 are we not counted of him strangers for he hath sold us and hath quite devoured also our money 3116 for all the riches which god hath taken from our father that is ours and our childrens now then whatsoever god hath said unto thee do 3117 then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon camels 3118 and he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he had gotten the cattle of his getting which he had gotten in padanaram for to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan 3119 and laban went to shear his sheep and rachel had stolen the images that were her fathers 3120 and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian in that he told him not that he fled 3121 so he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed over the river and set his face toward the mount gilead 3122 and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled 3123 and he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven days journey and they overtook him in the mount gilead 3124 and god came to laban the syrian in a dream by night and said unto him take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad 3125 then laban overtook jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in the mount and laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of gilead 3126 and laban said to jacob what hast thou done that thou hast stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives taken with the sword 3127 wherefore didst thou flee away secretly and steal away from me and didst not tell me that i might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp 3128 and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters thou hast now done foolishly in so doing 3129 it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the god of your father spake unto me yesternight saying take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad 3130 and now though thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sore longedst after thy fathers house yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods 3131 and jacob answered and said to laban because i was afraid for i said peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me 3132 with whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to thee for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them 3133 and laban went into jacobs tent and into leahs tent and into the two maidservants tents but he found them not then went he out of leahs tent and entered into rachels tent 3134 now rachel had taken the images and put them in the camels furniture and sat upon them and laban searched all the tent but found them not 3135 and she said to her father let it not displease my lord that i cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me and he searched but found not the images 3136 and jacob was wroth and chode with laban and jacob answered and said to laban what is my trespass what is my sin that thou hast so hotly pursued after me 3137 whereas thou hast searched all my stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set it here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us both 3138 this twenty years have i been with thee thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flock have i not eaten 3139 that which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee i bare the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by day or stolen by night 3140 thus i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep departed from mine eyes 3141 thus have i been twenty years in thy house i served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy cattle and thou hast changed my wages ten times 3142 except the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been with me surely thou hadst sent me away now empty god hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands and rebuked thee yesternight 3143 and laban answered and said unto jacob these daughters are my daughters and these children are my children and these cattle are my cattle and all that thou seest is mine and what can i do this day unto these my daughters or unto their children which they have born 3144 now therefore come thou let us make a covenant i and thou and let it be for a witness between me and thee 3145 and jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar 3146 and jacob said unto his brethren gather stones and they took stones and made an heap and they did eat there upon the heap 3147 and laban called it jegarsahadutha but jacob called it galeed 3148 and laban said this heap is a witness between me and thee this day therefore was the name of it called galeed 3149 and mizpah for he said the lord watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another 3150 if thou shalt afflict my daughters or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters no man is with us see god is witness betwixt me and thee 3151 and laban said to jacob behold this heap and behold this pillar which i have cast betwixt me and thee 3152 this heap be witness and this pillar be witness that i will not pass over this heap to thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me for harm 3153 the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge betwixt us and jacob sware by the fear of his father isaac 3154 then jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount and called his brethren to eat bread and they did eat bread and tarried all night in the mount 3155 and early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them and laban departed and returned unto his place 321 and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him 322 and when jacob saw them he said this is gods host and he called the name of that place mahanaim 323 and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the land of seir the country of edom 324 and he commanded them saying thus shall ye speak unto my lord esau thy servant jacob saith thus i have sojourned with laban and stayed there until now 325 and i have oxen and asses flocks and menservants and womenservants and i have sent to tell my lord that i may find grace in thy sight 326 and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thy brother esau and also he cometh to meet thee and four hundred men with him 327 then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands 328 and said if esau come to the one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape 329 and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac the lord which saidst unto me return unto thy country and to thy kindred and i will deal well with thee 3210 i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast shewed unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan and now i am become two bands 3211 deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children 3212 and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude 3213 and he lodged there that same night and took of that which came to his hand a present for esau his brother 3214 two hundred she goats and twenty he goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams 3215 thirty milch camels with their colts forty kine and ten bulls twenty she asses and ten foals 3216 and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove by themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me and put a space betwixt drove and drove 3217 and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou and whither goest thou and whose are these before thee 3218 then thou shalt say they be thy servant jacobs it is a present sent unto my lord esau and behold also he is behind us 3219 and so commanded he the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esau when ye find him 3220 and say ye moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us for he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward i will see his face peradventure he will accept of me 3221 so went the present over before him and himself lodged that night in the company 3222 and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford jabbok 3223 and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had 3224 and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day 3225 and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacobs thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him 3226 and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me 3227 and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob 3228 and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed 3229 and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there 3230 and jacob called the name of the place peniel for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved 3231 and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh 3232 therefore the children of israel eat not of the sinew which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of jacobs thigh in the sinew that shrank 331 and jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau came and with him four hundred men and he divided the children unto leah and unto rachel and unto the two handmaids 332 and he put the handmaids and their children foremost and leah and her children after and rachel and joseph hindermost 333 and he passed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother 334 and esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept 335 and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said who are those with thee and he said the children which god hath graciously given thy servant 336 then the handmaidens came near they and their children and they bowed themselves 337 and leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves and after came joseph near and rachel and they bowed themselves 338 and he said what meanest thou by all this drove which i met and he said these are to find grace in the sight of my lord 339 and esau said i have enough my brother keep that thou hast unto thyself 3310 and jacob said nay i pray thee if now i have found grace in thy sight then receive my present at my hand for therefore i have seen thy face as though i had seen the face of god and thou wast pleased with me 3311 take i pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee because god hath dealt graciously with me and because i have enough and he urged him and he took it 3312 and he said let us take our journey and let us go and i will go before thee 3313 and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children are tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men should overdrive them one day all the flock will die 3314 let my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant and i will lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure until i come unto my lord unto seir 3315 and esau said let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me and he said what needeth it let me find grace in the sight of my lord 3316 so esau returned that day on his way unto seir 3317 and jacob journeyed to succoth and built him an house and made booths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is called succoth 3318 and jacob came to shalem a city of shechem which is in the land of canaan when he came from padanaram and pitched his tent before the city 3319 and he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of hamor shechems father for an hundred pieces of money 3320 and he erected there an altar and called it eleloheisrael 341 and dinah the daughter of leah which she bare unto jacob went out to see the daughters of the land 342 and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite prince of the country saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled her 343 and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob and he loved the damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel 344 and shechem spake unto his father hamor saying get me this damsel to wife 345 and jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter now his sons were with his cattle in the field and jacob held his peace until they were come 346 and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune with him 347 and the sons of jacob came out of the field when they heard it and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had wrought folly in israel in lying with jacobs daughter which thing ought not to be done 348 and hamor communed with them saying the soul of my son shechem longeth for your daughter i pray you give her him to wife 349 and make ye marriages with us and give your daughters unto us and take our daughters unto you 3410 and ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you dwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions therein 3411 and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren let me find grace in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me i will give 3412 ask me never so much dowry and gift and i will give according as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife 3413 and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father deceitfully and said because he had defiled dinah their sister 3414 and they said unto them we cannot do this thing to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us 3415 but in this will we consent unto you if ye will be as we be that every male of you be circumcised 3416 then will we give our daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people 3417 but if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then will we take our daughter and we will be gone 3418 and their words pleased hamor and shechem hamors son 3419 and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had delight in jacobs daughter and he was more honourable than all the house of his father 3420 and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city and communed with the men of their city saying 3421 these men are peaceable with us therefore let them dwell in the land and trade therein for the land behold it is large enough for them let us take their daughters to us for wives and let us give them our daughters 3422 only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us to be one people if every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised 3423 shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours only let us consent unto them and they will dwell with us 3424 and unto hamor and unto shechem his son hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city and every male was circumcised all that went out of the gate of his city 3425 and it came to pass on the third day when they were sore that two of the sons of jacob simeon and levi dinahs brethren took each man his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males 3426 and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took dinah out of shechems house and went out 3427 the sons of jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city because they had defiled their sister 3428 they took their sheep and their oxen and their asses and that which was in the city and that which was in the field 3429 and all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives took they captive and spoiled even all that was in the house 3430 and jacob said to simeon and levi ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land among the canaanites and the perizzites and i being few in number they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me and i shall be destroyed i and my house 3431 and they said should he deal with our sister as with an harlot 351 and god said unto jacob arise go up to bethel and dwell there and make there an altar unto god that appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of esau thy brother 352 then jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments 353 and let us arise and go up to bethel and i will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went 354 and they gave unto jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their ears and jacob hid them under the oak which was by shechem 355 and they journeyed and the terror of god was upon the cities that were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of jacob 356 so jacob came to luz which is in the land of canaan that is bethel he and all the people that were with him 357 and he built there an altar and called the place elbethel because there god appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his brother 358 but deborah rebekahs nurse died and she was buried beneath bethel under an oak and the name of it was called allonbachuth 359 and god appeared unto jacob again when he came out of padanaram and blessed him 3510 and god said unto him thy name is jacob thy name shall not be called any more jacob but israel shall be thy name and he called his name israel 3511 and god said unto him i am god almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee and kings shall come out of thy loins 3512 and the land which i gave abraham and isaac to thee i will give it and to thy seed after thee will i give the land 3513 and god went up from him in the place where he talked with him 3514 and jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him even a pillar of stone and he poured a drink offering thereon and he poured oil thereon 3515 and jacob called the name of the place where god spake with him bethel 3516 and they journeyed from bethel and there was but a little way to come to ephrath and rachel travailed and she had hard labour 3517 and it came to pass when she was in hard labour that the midwife said unto her fear not thou shalt have this son also 3518 and it came to pass as her soul was in departing for she died that she called his name benoni but his father called him benjamin 3519 and rachel died and was buried in the way to ephrath which is bethlehem 3520 and jacob set a pillar upon her grave that is the pillar of rachels grave unto this day 3521 and israel journeyed and spread his tent beyond the tower of edar 3522 and it came to pass when israel dwelt in that land

isaac were an hundred and fourscore years 3529 and isaac gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people being old and full of days and his sons esau and jacob buried him 361 now these are

land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of canaan 372 these are the generations of jacob joseph being seventeen years old was feeding the flock with his brethren and the lad was with the sons of bilhah and with the sons of zilpah his fathers wives and joseph brought unto his father their evil report 373 now israel loved joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colours 374 and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him 375 and joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren and they hated him yet the more 376 and he said unto them hear i pray you this dream which i have dreamed 377 for behold we were binding sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf arose and also stood upright and behold your sheaves stood round about and made obeisance to my sheaf 378 and his brethren said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words 379 and he dreamed yet another dream and told it his brethren and said behold i have dreamed a dream more and behold the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me 3710 and he told it to his father and to his brethren and his father rebuked him and said unto him what is this dream that thou hast dreamed shall i and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth 3711 and his brethren envied him but his father observed the saying 3712 and his brethren went to feed their fathers flock in shechem 3713 and israel said unto joseph do not thy brethren feed the flock in shechem come and i will send thee unto them and he said to him here am i 3714 and he said to him go i pray thee see whether it be well with thy brethren and well with the flocks and bring me word again so he sent him out of the vale of hebron and he came to shechem 3715 and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field and the man asked him saying what seekest thou 3716 and he said i seek my brethren tell me i pray thee where they feed their flocks 3717 and the man said they are departed hence for i heard them say let us go to dothan and joseph went after his brethren and found them in dothan 3718 and when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him 3719 and they said one to another behold this dreamer cometh 3720 come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some pit and we will say some evil beast hath devoured him and we shall see what will become of his dreams 3721 and reuben heard it and he delivered him out of their hands and said let us not kill him 3722 and reuben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again 3723 and it came to pass when joseph was come unto his brethren that they stript joseph out of his coat his coat of many colours that was on him 3724 and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it 3725 and they sat down to eat bread and they lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of ishmeelites came from gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh going to carry it down to egypt 3726 and judah said unto his brethren what profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood 3727 come and let us sell him to the ishmeelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his brethren were content 3728 then there passed by midianites merchantmen and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver and they brought joseph into egypt 3729 and reuben returned unto the pit and behold joseph was not in the pit and he rent his clothes 3730 and he returned unto his brethren and said the child is not and i whither shall i go 3731 and they took josephs coat and killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood 3732 and they sent the coat of many colours and they brought it to their father and said this have we found know now whether it be thy sons coat or no 3733 and he knew it and said it is my sons coat an evil beast hath devoured him joseph is without doubt rent in pieces 3734 and jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many days 3735 and all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said for i will go down into the grave unto my son mourning thus his father wept for him 3736 and the midianites sold him into egypt unto potiphar an officer of pharaohs and captain of the guard 381 and it came to pass at that time that judah went down from his brethren and turned in to a certain adullamite whose name was hirah 382 and judah saw there a daughter of a certain canaanite whose name was shuah and he took her and went in unto her 383 and she conceived and bare a son and he called his name er 384 and she conceived again and bare a son and she called his name onan 385 and she yet again conceived and bare a son and called his name shelah and he was at chezib when she bare him 386 and judah took a wife for er his firstborn whose name was tamar 387 and er judahs firstborn was wicked in the sight of the lord and the lord slew him 388 and judah said unto onan go in unto thy brothers wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother 389 and onan knew that the seed should not be his and it came to pass when he went in unto his brothers wife that he spilled it on the ground lest that he should give seed to his brother 3810 and the thing which he did displeased the lord wherefore he slew him also 3811 then said judah to tamar his daughter in law remain a widow at thy fathers house till shelah my son be grown for he said lest peradventure he die also as his brethren did and tamar went and dwelt in her fathers house 3812 and in process of time the daughter of shuah judahs wife died and judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to timnath he and his friend hirah the adullamite 3813 and it was told tamar saying behold thy father in law goeth up to timnath to shear his sheep 3814 and she put her widows garments off from her and covered her with a vail and wrapped herself and sat in an open place which is by the way to timnath for she saw that shelah was grown and she was not given unto him to wife 3815 when judah saw her he thought her to be an harlot because she had covered her face 3816 and he turned unto her by the way and said go to i pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter in law and she said what wilt thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me 3817 and he said i will send thee a kid from the flock and she said wilt thou give me a pledge till thou send it 3818 and he said what pledge shall i give thee and she said thy signet and thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand and he gave it her and came in unto her and she conceived by him 3819 and she arose and went away and laid by her vail from her and put on the garments of her widowhood 3820 and judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the adullamite to receive his pledge from the womans hand but he found her not 3821 then he asked the men of that place saying where is the harlot that was openly by the way side and they said there was no harlot in this place 3822 and he returned to judah and said i cannot find her and also the men of the place said that there was no harlot in this place 3823 and judah said let her take it to her lest we be shamed behold i sent this kid and thou hast not found her 3824 and it came to pass about three months after that it was told judah saying tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot and also behold she is with child by whoredom and judah said bring her forth and let her be burnt 3825 when she was brought forth she sent to her father in law saying by the man whose these are am i with child and she said discern i pray thee whose are these the signet and bracelets and staff 3826 and judah acknowledged them and said she hath been more righteous than i because that i gave her not to shelah my son and he knew her again no more 3827 and it came to pass in the time of her travail that behold twins were in her womb 3828 and it came to pass when she travailed that the one put out his hand and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread saying this came out first 3829 and it came to pass as he drew back his hand that behold his brother came out and she said how hast thou broken forth this breach be upon thee therefore his name was called pharez 3830 and afterward came out his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand and his name was called zarah 391 and joseph was brought down to egypt and potiphar an officer of pharaoh captain of the guard an egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmeelites which had brought him down thither 392 and the lord was with joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the egyptian 393 and his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand 394 and joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand 395 and it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the lord blessed the egyptians house for josephs sake and the blessing of the lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field 396 and he left all that he had in josephs hand and he knew not ought he had save the bread which he did eat and joseph was a goodly person and well favoured 397 and it came to pass after these things that his masters wife cast her eyes upon joseph and she said lie with me 398 but he refused and said unto his masters wife behold my master wotteth not what is with me in the house and he hath committed all that he hath to my hand 399 there is none greater in this house than i neither hath he kept back any thing from me but thee because thou art his wife how then can i do this great wickedness and sin against god 3910 and it came to pass as she spake to joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her 3911 and it came to pass about this time that joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there within 3912 and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out 3913 and it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and was fled forth 3914 that she called unto the men of her house and spake unto them saying see he hath brought in an hebrew unto us to mock us he came in unto me to lie with me and i cried with a loud voice 3915 and it came to pass when he heard that i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled and got him out 3916 and she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home 3917 and she spake unto him according to these words saying the hebrew servant which thou hast brought unto us came in unto me to mock me 3918 and it came to pass as i lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled out 3919 and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife which she spake unto him saying after this manner did thy servant to me that his wrath was kindled 3920 and josephs master took him and put him into the prison a place where the kings prisoners were bound and he was there in the prison 3921 but the lord was with joseph and shewed him mercy and gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison 3922 and the keeper of the prison committed to josephs hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it 3923 the keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was under his hand because the lord was with him and that which he did the lord made it to prosper 401 and it came to pass after these things that the butler of the king of egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king of egypt 402 and pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers 403 and he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the guard into the prison the place where joseph was bound 404 and the captain of the guard charged joseph with them and he served them and they continued a season in ward 405 and they dreamed a dream both of them each man his dream in one night each man according to the interpretation of his dream the butler and the baker of the king of egypt which were bound in the prison 406 and joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon them and behold they were sad 407 and he asked pharaohs officers that were with him in the ward of his lords house saying wherefore look ye so sadly to day 408 and they said unto him we have dreamed a dream and there is no interpreter of it and joseph said unto them do not interpretations belong to god tell me them i pray you 409 and the chief butler told his dream to joseph and said to him in my dream behold a vine was before me 4010 and in the vine were three branches and it was as though it budded and her blossoms shot forth and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes 4011 and pharaohs cup was in my hand and i took the grapes and pressed them into pharaohs cup and i gave the cup into pharaohs hand 4012 and joseph said unto him this is the interpretation of it the three branches are three days 4013 yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thine head and restore thee unto thy place and thou shalt deliver pharaohs cup into his hand after the former manner when thou wast his butler 4014 but think on me when it shall be well with thee and shew kindness i pray thee unto me and make mention of me unto pharaoh and bring me out of this house 4015 for indeed i was stolen away out of the land of the hebrews and here also have i done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon 4016 when the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good he said unto joseph i also was in my dream and behold i had three white baskets on my head 4017 and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of bakemeats for pharaoh and the birds did eat them out of the basket upon my head 4018 and joseph answered and said this is the interpretation thereof the three baskets are three days 4019 yet within three days shall pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on a tree and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee 4020 and it came to pass the third day which was pharaohs birthday that he made a feast unto all his servants and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his servants 4021 and he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again and he gave the cup into pharaohs hand 4022 but he hanged the chief baker as joseph had interpreted to them 4023 yet did not the chief butler remember joseph but forgat him 411 and it came to pass at the end of two full years that pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river 412 and behold there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed and they fed in a meadow 413 and behold seven other kine came up after them out of the river ill favoured and leanfleshed and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river 414 and the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine so pharaoh awoke 415 and he slept and dreamed the second time and behold seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good 416 and behold seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them 417 and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears and pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream 418 and it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled and he sent and called for all the magicians of egypt and all the wise men thereof and pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them unto pharaoh 419 then spake the chief butler unto pharaoh saying i do remember my faults this day 4110 pharaoh was wroth with his servants and put me in ward in the captain of the guards house both me and the chief baker 4111 and we dreamed a dream in one night i and he we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream 4112 and there was there with us a young man an hebrew servant to the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpreted to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret 4113 and it came to pass as he interpreted to us so it was me he restored unto mine office and him he hanged 4114 then pharaoh sent and called joseph and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his raiment and came in unto pharaoh 4115 and pharaoh said unto joseph i have dreamed a dream and there is none that can interpret it and i have heard say of thee that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it 4116 and joseph answered pharaoh saying it is not in me god shall give pharaoh an answer of peace 4117 and pharaoh said unto joseph in my dream behold i stood upon the bank of the river 4118 and behold there came up out of the river seven kine fatfleshed and well favoured and they fed in a meadow 4119 and behold seven other kine came up after them poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed such as i never saw in all the land of egypt for badness 4120 and the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine 4121 and when they had eaten them up it could not be known that they had eaten them but they were still ill favoured as at the beginning so i awoke 4122 and i saw in my dream and behold seven ears came up in one stalk full and good 4123 and behold seven ears withered thin and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them 4124 and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears and i told this unto the magicians but there was none that could declare it to me 4125 and joseph said unto pharaoh the dream of pharaoh is one god hath shewed pharaoh what he is about to do 4126 the seven good kine are seven years and the seven good ears are seven years the dream is one 4127 and the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine 4128 this is the thing which i have spoken unto pharaoh what god is about to do he sheweth unto pharaoh 4129 behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of egypt 4130 and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of egypt and the famine shall consume the land 4131 and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shall be very grievous 4132 and for that the dream was doubled unto pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by god and god will shortly bring it to pass 4133 now therefore let pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise and set him over the land of egypt 4134 let pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of egypt in the seven plenteous years 4135 and let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities 4136 and that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of egypt that the land perish not through the famine 4137 and the thing was good in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants 4138 and pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the spirit of god is 4139 and pharaoh said unto joseph forasmuch as god hath shewed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou art 4140 thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will i be greater than thou 4141 and pharaoh said unto joseph see i have set thee over all the land of egypt 4142 and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon josephs hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck 4143 and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of egypt 4144 and pharaoh said unto joseph i am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of egypt 4145 and pharaoh called josephs name zaphnathpaaneah and he gave him to wife asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on and joseph went out over all the land of egypt 4146 and joseph was thirty years old when he stood before pharaoh king of egypt and joseph went out from the presence of pharaoh and went throughout all the land of egypt 4147 and in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls 4148 and he gathered up all the food of the seven years which were in the land of egypt and laid up the food in the cities the food of the field which was round about every city laid he up in the same 4149 and joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea very much until he left numbering for it was without number 4150 and unto joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto him 4151 and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for god said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my fathers house 4152 and the name of the second called he ephraim for god hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction 4153 and the seven years of plenteousness that was in the land of egypt were ended 4154 and the seven years of dearth began to come according as joseph had said and the dearth was in all lands but in all the land of egypt there was bread 4155 and when all the land of egypt was famished the people cried to pharaoh for bread and pharaoh said unto all the egyptians go unto joseph what he saith to you do 4156 and the famine was over all the face of the earth and joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the egyptians and the famine waxed sore in the land of egypt 4157 and all countries came into egypt to joseph for to buy corn because that the famine was so sore in all lands 421 now when jacob saw that there was corn in egypt jacob said unto his sons why do ye look one upon another 422 and he said behold i have heard that there is corn in egypt get you down thither and buy for us from thence that we may live and not die 423 and josephs ten brethren went down to buy corn in egypt 424 but benjamin josephs brother jacob sent not with his brethren for he said lest peradventure mischief befall him 425 and the sons of israel came to buy corn among those that came for the famine was in the land of canaan 426 and joseph was the governor over the land and he it was that sold to all the people of the land and josephs brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth 427 and joseph saw his brethren and he knew them but made himself strange unto them and spake roughly unto them and he said unto them whence come ye and they said from the land of canaan to buy food 428 and joseph knew his brethren but they knew not him 429 and joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and said unto them ye are spies to see the nakedness of the land ye are come 4210 and they said unto him nay my lord but to buy food are thy servants come 4211 we are all one mans sons we are true men thy servants are no spies 4212 and he said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come 4213 and they said thy servants are twelve brethren the sons of one man in the land of canaan and behold the youngest is this day with our father and one is not 4214 and joseph said unto them that is it that i spake unto you saying ye are spies 4215 hereby ye shall be proved by the life of pharaoh ye shall not go forth hence except your youngest brother come hither 4216 send one of you and let him fetch your brother and ye shall be kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be any truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely ye are spies 4217 and he put them all together into ward three days 4218 and joseph said unto them the third day this do and live for i fear god 4219 if ye be true men let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison go ye carry corn for the famine of your houses 4220 but bring your youngest brother unto me so shall your words be verified and ye shall not die and they did so 4221 and they said one to another we are verily guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us 4222 and reuben answered them saying spake i not unto you saying do not sin against the child and ye would not hear therefore behold also his blood is required 4223 and they knew not that joseph understood them for he spake unto them by an interpreter 4224 and he turned himself about from them and wept and returned to them again and communed with them and took from them simeon and bound him before their eyes 4225 then joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn and to restore every mans money into his sack and to give them provision for the way and thus did he unto them 4226 and they laded their asses with the corn and departed thence 4227 and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender in the inn he espied his money for behold it was in his sacks mouth 4228 and he said unto his brethren my money is restored and lo it is even in my sack and their heart failed them and they were afraid saying one to another what is this that god hath done unto us 4229 and they came unto jacob their father unto the land of canaan and told him all that befell unto them saying 4230 the man who is the lord of the land spake roughly to us and took us for spies of the country 4231 and we said unto him we are true men we are no spies 4232 we be twelve brethren sons of our father one is not and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of canaan 4233 and the man the lord of the country said unto us hereby shall i know that ye are true men leave one of your brethren here with me and take food for the famine of your households and be gone 4234 and bring your youngest brother unto me then shall i know that ye are no spies but that ye are true men so will i deliver you your brother and ye shall traffick in the land 4235 and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every mans bundle of money was in his sack and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money they were afraid 4236 and jacob their father said unto them me have ye bereaved of my children joseph is not and simeon is not and ye will take benjamin away all these things are against me 4237 and reuben spake unto his father saying slay my two sons if i bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and i will bring him to thee again 4238 and he said my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he is left alone if mischief befall him by the way in the which ye go then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave 431 and the famine was sore in the land 432 and it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of egypt their father said unto them go again buy us a little food 433 and judah spake unto him saying the man did solemnly protest unto us saying ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you 434 if thou wilt send our brother with us we will go down and buy thee food 435 but if thou wilt not send him we will not go down for the man said unto us ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you 436 and israel said wherefore dealt ye so ill with me as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother 437 and they said the man asked us straitly of our state and of our kindred saying is your father yet alive have ye another brother and we told him according to the tenor of these words could we certainly know that he would say bring your brother down 438 and judah said unto israel his father send the lad with me and we will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones 439 i will be surety for him of my hand shalt thou require him if i bring him not unto thee and set him before thee then let me bear the blame for ever 4310 for except we had lingered surely now we had returned this second time 4311 and their father israel said unto them if it must be so now do this take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels and carry down the man a present a little balm and a little honey spices and myrrh nuts and almonds 4312 and take double money in your hand and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks carry it again in your hand peradventure it was an oversight 4313 take also your brother and arise go again unto the man 4314 and god almighty give you mercy before the man that he may send away your other brother and benjamin if i be bereaved of my children i am bereaved 4315 and the men took that present and they took double money in their hand and benjamin and rose up and went down to egypt and stood before joseph 4316 and when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the ruler of his house bring these men home and slay and make ready for these men shall dine with me at noon 4317 and the man did as joseph bade and the man brought the men into josephs house 4318 and the men were afraid because they were brought into josephs house and they said because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for bondmen and our asses 4319 and they came near to the steward of josephs house and they communed with him at the door of the house 4320 and said o sir we came indeed down at the first time to buy food 4321 and it came to pass when we came to the inn that we opened our sacks and behold every mans money was in the mouth of his sack our money in full weight and we have brought it again in our hand 4322 and other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks 4323 and he said peace be to you fear not your god and the god of your father hath given you treasure in your sacks i had your money and he brought simeon out unto them 4324 and the man brought the men into josephs house and gave them water and they washed their feet and he gave their asses provender 4325 and they made ready the present against joseph came at noon for they heard that they should eat bread there 4326 and when joseph came home they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house and bowed themselves to him to the earth 4327 and he asked them of their welfare and said is your father well the old man of whom ye spake is he yet alive 4328 and they answered thy servant our father is in good health he is yet alive and they bowed down their heads and made obeisance 4329 and he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother benjamin his mothers son and said is this your younger brother of whom ye spake unto me and he said god be gracious unto thee my son 4330 and joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon his brother and he sought where to weep and he entered into his chamber and wept there 4331 and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and said set on bread 4332 and they set on for him by himself and for them by themselves and for the egyptians which did eat with him by themselves because the egyptians might not eat bread with the hebrews for that is an abomination unto the egyptians 4333 and they sat before him the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth and the men marvelled one at another 4334 and he took and sent messes unto them from before him but benjamins mess was five times so much as any of theirs and they drank and were merry with him 441 and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the mens sacks with food as much as they can carry and put every mans money in his sacks mouth 442 and put my cup the silver cup in the sacks mouth of the youngest and his corn money and he did according to the word that joseph had spoken 443 as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away they and their asses 444 and when they were gone out of the city and not yet far off joseph said unto his steward up follow after the men and when thou dost overtake them say unto them wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good 445 is not this it in which my lord drinketh and whereby indeed he divineth ye have done evil in so doing 446 and he overtook them and he spake unto them these same words 447 and they said unto him wherefore saith my lord these words god forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing 448 behold the money which we found in our sacks mouths we brought again unto thee out of the land of canaan how then should we steal out of thy lords house silver or gold 449 with whomsoever of thy servants it be found both let him die and we also will be my lords bondmen 4410 and he said now also let it be according unto your words he with whom it is found shall be my servant and ye shall be blameless 4411 then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground and opened every man his sack 4412 and he searched and began at the eldest and left at the youngest and the cup was found in benjamins sack 4413 then they rent their clothes and laded every man his ass and returned to the city 4414 and judah and his brethren came to josephs house for he was yet there and they fell before him on the ground 4415 and joseph said unto them what deed is this that ye have done wot ye not that such a man as i can certainly divine 4416 and judah said what shall we say unto my lord what shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves god hath found out the iniquity of thy servants behold we are my lords servants both we and he also with whom the cup is found 4417 and he said god forbid that i should do so but the man in whose hand the cup is found he shall be my servant and as for you get you up in peace unto your father 4418 then judah came near unto him and said oh my lord let thy servant i pray thee speak a word in my lords ears and let not thine anger burn against thy servant for thou art even as pharaoh 4419 my lord asked his servants saying have ye a father or a brother 4420 and we said unto my lord we have a father an old man and a child of his old age a little one and his brother is dead and he alone is left of his mother and his father loveth him 4421 and thou saidst unto thy servants bring him down unto me that i may set mine eyes upon him 4422 and we said unto my lord the lad cannot leave his father for if he should leave his father his father would die 4423 and thou saidst unto thy servants except your youngest brother come down with you ye shall see my face no more 4424 and it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father we told him the words of my lord 4425 and our father said go again and buy us a little food 4426 and we said we cannot go down if our youngest brother be with us then will we go down for we may not see the mans face except our youngest brother be with us 4427 and thy servant my father said unto us ye know that my wife bare me two sons 4428 and the one went out from me and i said surely he is torn in pieces and i saw him not since 4429 and if ye take this also from me and mischief befall him ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave 4430 now therefore when i come to thy servant my father and the lad be not with us seeing that his life is bound up in the lads life 4431 it shall come to pass when he seeth that the lad is not with us that he will die and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave 4432 for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father saying if i bring him not unto thee then i shall bear the blame to my father for ever 4433 now therefore i pray thee let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord and let the lad go up with his brethren 4434 for how shall i go up to my father and the lad be not with me lest peradventure i see the evil that shall come on my father 451 then joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him and he cried cause every man to go out from me and there stood no man with him while joseph made himself known unto his brethren 452 and he wept aloud and the egyptians and the house of pharaoh heard 453 and joseph said unto his brethren i am joseph doth my father yet live and his brethren could not answer him for they were troubled at his presence 454 and joseph said unto his brethren come near to me i pray you and they came near and he said i am joseph your brother whom ye sold into egypt 455 now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither for god did send me before you to preserve life 456 for these two years hath the famine been in the land and yet there are five years in the which there shall neither be earing nor harvest 457 and god sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance 458 so now it was not you that sent me hither but god and he hath made me a father to pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of egypt 459 haste ye and go up to my father and say unto him thus saith thy son joseph god hath made me lord of all egypt come down unto me tarry not 4510 and thou shalt dwell in the land of goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and thy childrens children and thy flocks and thy herds and all that thou hast 4511 and there will i nourish thee for yet there are five years of famine lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast come to poverty 4512 and behold your eyes see and the eyes of my brother benjamin that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you 4513 and ye shall tell my father of all my glory in egypt and of all that ye have seen and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither 4514 and he fell upon his brother benjamins neck and wept and benjamin wept upon his neck 4515 moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them and after that his brethren talked with him 4516 and the fame thereof was heard in pharaohs house saying josephs brethren are come and it pleased pharaoh well and his servants 4517 and pharaoh said unto joseph say unto thy brethren this do ye lade your beasts and go get you unto the land of canaan 4518 and take your father and your households and come unto me and i will give you the good of the land of egypt and ye shall eat the fat of the land 4519 now thou art commanded this do ye take you wagons out of the land of egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come 4520 also regard not your stuff for the good of all the land of egypt is yours 4521 and the children of israel did so and joseph gave them wagons according to the commandment of pharaoh and gave them provision for the way 4522 to all of them he gave each man changes of raiment but to benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of raiment 4523 and to his father he sent after this manner ten asses laden with the good things of egypt and ten she asses laden with corn and bread and meat for his father by the way 4524 so he sent his brethren away and they departed and he said unto them see that ye fall not out by the way 4525 and they went up out of egypt and came into the land of canaan unto jacob their father 4526 and told him saying joseph is yet alive and he is governor over all the land of egypt and jacobs heart fainted for he believed them not 4527 and they told him all the words of joseph which he had said unto them and when he saw the wagons which joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of jacob their father revived 4528 and israel said it is enough joseph my son is yet alive i will go and see him before i die 461 and israel took his journey with all that he had and came to beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the god of his father isaac 462 and god spake unto israel in the visions of the night and said jacob jacob and he said here am i 463 and he said i am god the god of thy father fear not to go down into egypt for i will there make of thee a great nation 464 i will go down with thee into egypt and i will also surely bring thee up again and joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes 465 and jacob rose up from beersheba and the sons of israel carried jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which pharaoh had sent to carry him 466 and they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of canaan and came into egypt jacob and all his seed with him 467 his sons and his sons sons with him his daughters and his sons daughters and all his seed brought he with him into egypt 468 and these are the names of the children of israel which came into egypt jacob and his sons reuben jacobs firstborn 469 and the sons of reuben hanoch and phallu and hezron and carmi 4610 and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman 4611 and the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari 4612 and the sons of judah er and onan and shelah and pharez and zarah but er and onan died in the land of canaan and the sons of pharez were hezron and hamul 4613 and the sons of issachar tola and phuvah and job and shimron 4614 and the sons of zebulun sered and elon and jahleel 4615 these be the sons of leah which she bare unto jacob in padanaram with his daughter dinah all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty and three 4616 and the sons of gad ziphion and haggi shuni and ezbon eri and arodi and areli 4617 and the sons of asher jimnah and ishuah and isui and beriah and serah their sister and the sons of beriah heber and malchiel 4618 these are the sons of zilpah whom laban gave to leah his daughter and these she bare unto jacob even sixteen souls 4619 the sons of rachel jacobs wife joseph and benjamin 4620 and unto joseph in the land of egypt were born manasseh and ephraim which asenath the daughter of potipherah priest of on bare unto him 4621 and the sons of benjamin were belah and becher and ashbel gera and naaman ehi and rosh muppim and huppim and ard 4622 these are the sons of rachel which were born to jacob all the souls were fourteen 4623 and the sons of dan hushim 4624 and the sons of naphtali jahzeel and guni and jezer and shillem 4625 these are the sons of bilhah which laban gave unto rachel his daughter and she bare these unto jacob all the souls were seven 4626 all the souls that came with jacob into egypt which came out of his loins besides jacobs sons wives all the souls were threescore and six 4627 and the sons of joseph which were born him in egypt were two souls all the souls of the house of jacob which came into egypt were threescore and ten 4628 and he sent judah before him unto joseph to direct his face unto goshen and they came into the land of goshen 4629 and joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet israel his father to goshen and presented himself unto him and he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while 4630 and israel said unto joseph now let me die since i have seen thy face because thou art yet alive 4631 and joseph said unto his brethren and unto his fathers house i will go up and shew pharaoh and say unto him my brethren and my fathers house which were in the land of canaan are come unto me 4632 and the men are shepherds for their trade hath been to feed cattle and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have 4633 and it shall come to pass when pharaoh shall call you and shall say what is your occupation 4634 that ye shall say thy servants trade hath been about cattle from our youth even until now both we and also our fathers that ye may dwell in the land of goshen for every shepherd is an abomination unto the egyptians 471 then joseph came and told pharaoh and said my father and my brethren and their flocks and their herds and all that they have are come out of the land of canaan and behold they are in the land of goshen 472 and he took some of his brethren even five men and presented them unto pharaoh 473 and pharaoh said unto his brethren what is your occupation and they said unto pharaoh thy servants are shepherds both we and also our fathers 474 they said morever unto pharaoh for to sojourn in the land are we come for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks for the famine is sore in the land of canaan now therefore we pray thee let thy servants dwell in the land of goshen 475 and pharaoh spake unto joseph saying thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee 476 the land of egypt is before thee in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell in the land of goshen let them dwell and if thou knowest any men of activity among them then make them rulers over my cattle 477 and joseph brought in jacob his father and set him before pharaoh and jacob blessed pharaoh 478 and pharaoh said unto jacob how old art thou 479 and jacob said unto pharaoh the days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years few and evil have the days of the years of my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage 4710 and jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from before pharaoh 4711 and joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a possession in the land of egypt in the best of the land in the land of rameses as pharaoh had commanded 4712 and joseph nourished his father and his brethren and all his fathers household with bread according to their families 4713 and there was no bread in all the land for the famine was very sore so that the land of egypt and all the land of canaan fainted by reason of the famine 4714 and joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan for the corn which they bought and joseph brought the money into pharaohs house 4715 and when money failed in the land of egypt and in the land of canaan all the egyptians came unto joseph and said give us bread for why should we die in thy presence for the money faileth 4716 and joseph said give your cattle and i will give you for your cattle if money fail 4717 and they brought their cattle unto joseph and joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for the flocks and for the cattle of the herds and for the asses and he fed them with bread for all their cattle for that year 4718 when that year was ended they came unto him the second year and said unto him we will not hide it from my lord how that our money is spent my lord also hath our herds of cattle there is not ought left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands 4719 wherefore shall we die before thine eyes both we and our land buy us and our land for bread and we and our land will be servants unto pharaoh and give us seed that we may live and not die that the land be not desolate 4720 and joseph bought all the land of egypt for pharaoh for the egyptians sold every man his field because the famine prevailed over them so the land became pharaohs 4721 and as for the people he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of egypt even to the other end thereof 4722 only the land of the priests bought he not for the priests had a portion assigned them of pharaoh and did eat their portion which pharaoh gave them wherefore they sold not their lands 4723 then joseph said unto the people behold i have bought you this day and your land for pharaoh lo here is seed for you and ye shall sow the land 4724 and it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give the fifth part unto pharaoh and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for them of your households and for food for your little ones 4725 and they said thou hast saved our lives let us find grace in the sight of my lord and we will be pharaohs servants 4726 and joseph made it a law over the land of egypt unto this day that pharaoh should have the fifth part except the land of the priests only which became not pharaohs 4727 and israel dwelt in the land of egypt in the country of goshen and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedingly 4728 and jacob lived in the land of egypt seventeen years so the whole age of jacob was an hundred forty and seven years 4729 and the time drew nigh that israel must die and he called his son joseph and said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me bury me not i pray thee in egypt 4730 but i will lie with my fathers and thou shalt carry me out of egypt and bury me in their buryingplace and he said i will do as thou hast said 4731 and he said swear unto me and he sware unto him and israel bowed himself upon the beds head 481 and it came to pass after these things that one told joseph behold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons manasseh and ephraim 482 and one told jacob and said behold thy son joseph cometh unto thee and israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed 483 and jacob said unto joseph god almighty appeared unto me at luz in the land of canaan and blessed me 484 and said unto me behold i will make thee fruitful and multiply thee and i will make of thee a multitude of people and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession 485 and now thy two sons ephraim and manasseh which were born unto thee in the land of egypt before i came unto thee into egypt are mine as reuben and simeon they shall be mine 486 and thy issue which thou begettest after them shall be thine and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance 487 and as for me when i came from padan rachel died by me in the land of canaan in the way when yet there was but a little way to come unto ephrath and i buried her there in the way of ephrath the same is bethlehem 488 and israel beheld josephs sons and said who are these 489 and joseph said unto his father they are my sons whom god hath given me in this place and he said bring them i pray thee unto me and i will bless them 4810 now the eyes of israel were dim for age so that he could not see and he brought them near unto him and he kissed them and embraced them 4811 and israel said unto joseph i had not thought to see thy face and lo god hath shewed me also thy seed 4812 and joseph brought them out from between his knees and he bowed himself with his face to the earth 4813 and joseph took them both ephraim in his right hand toward israels left hand and manasseh in his left hand toward israels right hand and brought them near unto him 4814 and israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon ephraims head who was the younger and his left hand upon manassehs head guiding his hands wittingly for manasseh was the firstborn 4815 and he blessed joseph and said god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac did walk the god which fed me all my life long unto this day 4816 the angel which redeemed me from all evil bless the lads and let my name be named on them and the name of my fathers abraham and isaac and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth 4817 and when joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of ephraim it displeased him and he held up his fathers hand to remove it from ephraims head unto manassehs head 4818 and joseph said unto his father not so my father for this is the firstborn put thy right hand upon his head 4819 and his father refused and said i know it my son i know it he also shall become a people and he also shall be great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of nations 4820 and he blessed them that day saying in thee shall israel bless saying god make thee as ephraim and as manasseh and he set ephraim before manasseh 4821 and israel said unto joseph behold i die but god shall be with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers 4822 moreover i have given to thee one portion above thy brethren which i took out of the hand of the amorite with my sword and with my bow 491 and jacob called unto his sons and said gather yourselves together that i may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days 492 gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of jacob and hearken unto israel your father 493 reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power 494 unstable as water thou shalt not excel because thou wentest up to thy fathers bed then defiledst thou it he went up to my couch 495 simeon and levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their habitations 496 o my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honour be not thou united for in their anger they slew a man and in their selfwill they digged down a wall 497 cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their wrath for it was cruel i will divide them in jacob and scatter them in israel 498 judah thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies thy fathers children shall bow down before thee 499 judah is a lions whelp from the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rouse him up 4910 the sceptre shall not depart from judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be 4911 binding his foal unto the vine and his asss colt unto the choice vine he washed his garments in wine and his clothes in the blood of grapes 4912 his eyes shall be red with wine and his teeth white with milk 4913 zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea and he shall be for an haven of ships and his border shall be unto zidon 4914 issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens 4915 and he saw that rest was good and the land that it was pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto tribute 4916 dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of israel 4917 dan shall be a serpent by the way an adder in the path that biteth the horse heels so that his rider shall fall backward 4918 i have waited for thy salvation o lord 4919 gad a troop shall overcome him but he shall overcome at the last 4920 out of asher his bread shall be fat and he shall yield royal dainties 4921 naphtali is a hind let loose he giveth goodly words 4922 joseph is a fruitful bough even a fruitful bough by a well whose branches run over the wall 4923 the archers have sorely grieved him and shot at him and hated him 4924 but his bow abode in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty god of jacob from thence is the shepherd the stone of israel 4925 even by the god of thy father who shall help thee and by the almighty who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above blessings of the deep that lieth under blessings of the breasts and of the womb 4926 the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of joseph and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren 4927 benjamin shall ravin as a wolf in the morning he shall devour the prey and at night he shall divide the spoil 4928 all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them every one according to his blessing he blessed them 4929 and he charged them and said unto them i am to be gathered unto my people bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of ephron the hittite 4930 in the cave that is in the field of machpelah which is before mamre in the land of canaan which abraham bought with the field of ephron the hittite for a possession of a buryingplace 4931 there they buried abraham and sarah his wife there they buried isaac and rebekah his wife and there i buried leah 4932 the purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of heth 4933 and when jacob had made an end of commanding his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was gathered unto his people 501 and joseph fell upon his fathers face and wept upon him and kissed him 502 and joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed israel 503 and forty days were fulfilled for him for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed and the egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days 504 and when the days of his mourning were past joseph spake unto the house of pharaoh saying if now i have found grace in your eyes speak i pray you in the ears of pharaoh saying 505 my father made me swear saying lo i die in my grave which i have digged for me in the land of canaan there shalt thou bury me now therefore let me go up i pray thee and bury my father and i will come again 506 and pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear 507 and joseph went up to bury his father and with him went up all the servants of pharaoh the elders of his house and all the elders of the land of egypt 508 and all the house of joseph and his brethren and his fathers house only their little ones and their flocks and their herds they left in the land of goshen 509 and there went up with him both chariots and horsemen and it was a very great company 5010 and they came to the threshingfloor of atad which is beyond jordan and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation and he made a mourning for his father seven days 5011 and when the inhabitants of the land the canaanites saw the mourning in the floor of atad they said this is a grievous mourning to the egyptians wherefore the name of it was called abelmizraim which is beyond jordan 5012 and his sons did unto him according as he commanded them 5013 for his sons carried him into the land of canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of machpelah which abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of ephron the hittite before mamre 5014 and joseph returned into egypt he and his brethren and all that went up with him to bury his father after he had buried his father 5015 and when josephs brethren saw that their father was dead they said joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him 5016 and they sent a messenger unto joseph saying thy father did command before he died saying 5017 so shall ye say unto joseph forgive i pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin for they did unto thee evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of the servants of the god of thy father and joseph wept when they spake unto him 5018 and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said behold we be thy servants 5019 and joseph said unto them fear not for am i in the place of god 5020 but as for you ye thought evil against me but god meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive 5021 now therefore fear ye not i will nourish you and your little ones and he comforted them and spake kindly unto them 5022 and joseph dwelt in egypt he and his fathers house and joseph lived an hundred and ten years 5023 and joseph saw ephraims children of the third generation the children also of machir the son of manasseh were brought up upon josephs knees 5024 and joseph said unto his brethren i die and god will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to abraham to isaac and to jacob 5025 and joseph took an oath of the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones from hence 5026 so joseph died being an hundred and ten years old and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in egypt the second book of moses called exodus 11 now these are the names of the children of israel which came into egypt every man and his household came with jacob 12 reuben simeon levi and judah 13 issachar zebulun and benjamin 14 dan and naphtali gad and asher 15 and all the souls that came out of the loins of jacob were seventy souls for joseph was in egypt already 16 and joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation 17 and the children of israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty and the land was filled with them 18 now there arose up a new king over egypt which knew not joseph 19 and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of israel are more and mightier than we 110 come on let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when there falleth out any war they join also unto our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land 111 therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens and they built for pharaoh treasure cities pithom and raamses 112 but the more they afflicted them the more they multiplied and grew and they were grieved because of the children of israel 113 and the egyptians made the children of israel to serve with rigour 114 and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage in morter and in brick and in all manner of service in the field all their service wherein they made them serve was with rigour 115 and the king of egypt spake to the hebrew midwives of which the name of the one was shiphrah and the name of the other puah 116 and he said when ye do the office of a midwife to the hebrew women and see them upon the stools if it be a son then ye shall kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall live 117 but the midwives feared god and did not as the king of egypt commanded them but saved the men children alive 118 and the king of egypt called for the midwives and said unto them why have ye done this thing and have saved the men children alive 119 and the midwives said unto pharaoh because the hebrew women are not as the egyptian women for they are lively and are delivered ere the midwives come in unto them 120 therefore god dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty 121 and it came to pass because the midwives feared god that he made them houses 122 and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save alive 21 and there went a man of the house of levi and took to wife a daughter of levi 22 and the woman conceived and bare a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months 23 and when she could not longer hide him she took for him an ark of bulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and put the child therein and she laid it in the flags by the rivers brink 24 and his sister stood afar off to wit what would be done to him 25 and the daughter of pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river and her maidens walked along by the rivers side and when she saw the ark among the flags she sent her maid to fetch it 26 and when she had opened it she saw the child and behold the babe wept and she had compassion on him and said this is one of the hebrews children 27 then said his sister to pharaohs daughter shall i go and call to thee a nurse of the hebrew women that she may nurse the child for thee 28 and pharaohs daughter said to her go and the maid went and called the childs mother 29 and pharaohs daughter said unto her take this child away and nurse it for me and i will give thee thy wages and the women took the child and nursed it 210 and the child grew and she brought him unto pharaohs daughter and he became her son and she called his name moses and she said because i drew him out of the water 211 and it came to pass in those days when moses was grown that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens and he spied an egyptian smiting an hebrew one of his brethren 212 and he looked this way and that way and when he saw that there was no man he slew the egyptian and hid him in the sand 213 and when he went out the second day behold two men of the hebrews strove together and he said to him that did the wrong wherefore smitest thou thy fellow 214 and he said who made thee a prince and a judge over us intendest thou to kill me as thou killedst the egyptian and moses feared and said surely this thing is known 215 now when pharaoh heard this thing he sought to slay moses but moses fled from the face of pharaoh and dwelt in the land of midian and he sat down by a well 216 now the priest of midian had seven daughters and they came and drew water and filled the troughs to water their fathers flock 217 and the shepherds came and drove them away but moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock 218 and when they came to reuel their father he said how is it that ye are come so soon to day 219 and they said an egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds and also drew water enough for us and watered the flock 220 and he said unto his daughters and where is he why is it that ye have left the man call him that he may eat bread 221 and moses was content to dwell with the man and he gave moses zipporah his daughter 222 and she bare him a son and he called his name gershom for he said i have been a stranger in a strange land 223 and it came to pass in process of time that the king of egypt died and the children of israel sighed by reason of the bondage and they cried and their cry came up unto god by reason of the bondage 224 and god heard their groaning and god remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob 225 and god looked upon the children of israel and god had respect unto them 31 now moses kept the flock of jethro his father in law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to the mountain of god even to horeb 32 and the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush and he looked and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed 33 and moses said i will now turn aside and see this great sight why the bush is not burnt 34 and when the lord saw that he turned aside to see god called unto him out of the midst of the bush and said moses moses and he said here am i 35 and he said draw not nigh hither put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground 36 moreover he said i am the god of thy father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob and moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon god 37 and the lord said i have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for i know their sorrows 38 and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites 39 now therefore behold the cry of the children of israel is come unto me and i have also seen the oppression wherewith the egyptians oppress them 310 come now therefore and i will send thee unto pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of israel out of egypt 311 and moses said unto god who am i that i should go unto pharaoh and that i should bring forth the children of israel out of egypt 312 and he said certainly i will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that i have sent thee when thou hast brought forth the people out of egypt ye shall serve god upon this mountain 313 and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them 314 and god said unto moses i am that i am and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you 315 and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name for ever and this is my memorial unto all generations 316 go and gather the elders of israel together and say unto them the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham of isaac and of jacob appeared unto me saying i have surely visited you and seen that which is done to you in egypt 317 and i have said i will bring you up out of the affliction of egypt unto the land of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites unto a land flowing with milk and honey 318 and they shall hearken to thy voice and thou shalt come thou and the elders of israel unto the king of egypt and ye shall say unto him the lord god of the hebrews hath met with us and now let us go we beseech thee three days journey into the wilderness that we may sacrifice to the lord our god 319 and i am sure that the king of egypt will not let you go no not by a mighty hand 320 and i will stretch out my hand and smite egypt with all my wonders which i will do in the midst thereof and after that he will let you go 321 and i will give this people favour in the sight of the egyptians and it shall come to pass that when ye go ye shall not go empty 322 but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour and of her that sojourneth in her house jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters and ye shall spoil the egyptians 41 and moses answered and said but behold they will not believe me nor hearken unto my voice for they will say the lord hath not appeared unto thee 42 and the lord said unto him what is that in thine hand and he said a rod 43 and he said cast it on the ground and he cast it on the ground and it became a serpent and moses fled from before it 44 and the lord said unto moses put forth thine hand and take it by the tail and he put forth his hand and caught it and it became a rod in his hand 45 that they may believe that the lord god of their fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath appeared unto thee 46 and the lord said furthermore unto him put now thine hand into thy bosom and he put his hand into his bosom and when he took it out behold his hand was leprous as snow 47 and he said put thine hand into thy bosom again and he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom and behold it was turned again as his other flesh 48 and it shall come to pass if they will not believe thee neither hearken to the voice of the first sign that they will believe the voice of the latter sign 49 and it shall come to pass if they will not believe also these two signs neither hearken unto thy voice that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land 410 and moses said unto the lord o my lord i am not eloquent neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant but i am slow of speech and of a slow tongue 411 and the lord said unto him who hath made mans mouth or who maketh the dumb or deaf or the seeing or the blind have not i the lord 412 now therefore go and i will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say 413 and he said o my lord send i pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt send 414 and the anger of the lord was kindled against moses and he said is not aaron the levite thy brother i know that he can speak well and also behold he cometh forth to meet thee and when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart 415 and thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth and i will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye shall do 416 and he shall be thy spokesman unto the people and he shall be even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth and thou shalt be to him instead of god 417 and thou shalt take this rod in thine hand wherewith thou shalt do signs 418 and moses went and returned to jethro his father in law and said unto him let me go i pray thee and return unto my brethren which are in egypt and see whether they be yet alive and jethro said to moses go in peace 419 and the lord said unto moses in midian go return into egypt for all the men are dead which sought thy life 420 and moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass and he returned to the land of egypt and moses took the rod of god in his hand 421 and the lord said unto moses when thou goest to return into egypt see that thou do all those wonders before pharaoh which i have put in thine hand but i will harden his heart that he shall not let the people go 422 and thou shalt say unto pharaoh thus saith the lord israel is my son even my firstborn 423 and i say unto thee let my son go that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go behold i will slay thy son even thy firstborn 424 and it came to pass by the way in the inn that the lord met him and sought to kill him 425 then zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet and said surely a bloody husband art thou to me 426 so he let him go then she said a bloody husband thou art because of the circumcision 427 and the lord said to aaron go into the wilderness to meet moses and he went and met him in the mount of god and kissed him 428 and moses told aaron all the words of the lord who had sent him and all the signs which he had commanded him 429 and moses and aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the children of israel 430 and aaron spake all the words which the lord had spoken unto moses and did the signs in the sight of the people 431 and the people believed and when they heard that the lord had visited the children of israel and that he had looked upon their affliction then they bowed their heads and worshipped 51 and afterward moses and aaron went in and told pharaoh thus saith the lord god of israel let my people go that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness 52 and pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey his voice to let israel go i know not the lord neither will i let israel go 53 and they said the god of the hebrews hath met with us let us go we pray thee three days journey into the desert and sacrifice unto the lord our god lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with the sword 54 and the king of egypt said unto them wherefore do ye moses and aaron let the people from their works get you unto your burdens 55 and pharaoh said behold the people of the land now are many and ye make them rest from their burdens 56 and pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people and their officers saying 57 ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as heretofore let them go and gather straw for themselves 58 and the tale of the bricks which they did make heretofore ye shall lay upon them ye shall not diminish ought thereof for they be idle therefore they cry saying let us go and sacrifice to our god 59 let there more work be laid upon the men that they may labour therein and let them not regard vain words 510 and the taskmasters of the people went out and their officers and they spake to the people saying thus saith pharaoh i will not give you straw 511 go ye get you straw where ye can find it yet not ought of your work shall be diminished 512 so the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of egypt to gather stubble instead of straw 513 and the taskmasters hasted them saying fulfil your works your daily tasks as when there was straw 514 and the officers of the children of israel which pharaohs taskmasters had set over them were beaten and demanded wherefore have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick both yesterday and to day as heretofore 515 then the officers of the children of israel came and cried unto pharaoh saying wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants 516 there is no straw given unto thy servants and they say to us make brick and behold thy servants are beaten but the fault is in thine own people 517 but he said ye are idle ye are idle therefore ye say let us go and do sacrifice to the lord 518 go therefore now and work for there shall no straw be given you yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks 519 and the officers of the children of israel did see that they were in evil case after it was said ye shall not minish ought from your bricks of your daily task 520 and they met moses and aaron who stood in the way as they came forth from pharaoh 521 and they said unto them the lord look upon you and judge because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants to put a sword in their hand to slay us 522 and moses returned unto the lord and said lord wherefore hast thou so evil entreated this people why is it that thou hast sent me 523 for since i came to pharaoh to speak in thy name he hath done evil to this people neither hast thou delivered thy people at all 61 then the lord said unto moses now shalt thou see what i will do to pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he let them go and with a strong hand shall he drive them out of his land 62 and god spake unto moses and said unto him i am the lord 63 and i appeared unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob by the name of god almighty but by my name jehovah was i not known to them 64 and i have also established my covenant with them to give them the land of canaan the land of their pilgrimage wherein they were strangers 65 and i have also heard the groaning of the children of israel whom the egyptians keep in bondage and i have remembered my covenant 66 wherefore say unto the children of israel i am the lord and i will bring you out from under the burdens of the egyptians and i will rid you out of their bondage and i will redeem you with a stretched out arm and with great judgments 67 and i will take you to me for a people and i will be to you a god and ye shall know that i am the lord your god which bringeth you out from under the burdens of the egyptians 68 and i will bring you in unto the land concerning the which i did swear to give it to abraham to isaac and to jacob and i will give it you for an heritage i am the lord 69 and moses spake so unto the children of israel but they hearkened not unto moses for anguish of spirit and for cruel bondage 610 and the lord spake unto moses saying 611 go in speak unto pharaoh king of egypt that he let the children of israel go out of his land 612 and moses spake before the lord saying behold the children of israel have not hearkened unto me how then shall pharaoh hear me who am of uncircumcised lips 613 and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron and gave them a charge unto the children of israel and unto pharaoh king of egypt to bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt 614 these be the heads of their fathers houses the sons of reuben the firstborn of israel hanoch and pallu hezron and carmi these be the families of reuben 615 and the sons of simeon jemuel and jamin and ohad and jachin and zohar and shaul the son of a canaanitish woman these are the families of simeon 616 and these are the names of the sons of levi according to their generations gershon and kohath and merari and the years of the life of levi were an hundred thirty and seven years 617 the sons of gershon libni and shimi according to their families 618 and the sons of kohath amram and izhar and hebron and uzziel and the years of the life of kohath were an hundred thirty and three years 619 and the sons of merari mahali and mushi these are the families of levi according to their generations 620 and amram took him jochebed his fathers sister to wife and she bare him aaron and moses and the years of the life of amram were an hundred and thirty and seven years 621 and the sons of izhar korah and nepheg and zichri 622 and the sons of uzziel mishael and elzaphan and zithri 623 and aaron took him elisheba daughter of amminadab sister of naashon to wife and she bare him nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar 624 and the sons of korah assir and elkanah and abiasaph these are the families of the korhites 625 and eleazar aarons son took him one of the daughters of putiel to wife and she bare him phinehas these are the heads of the fathers of the levites according to their families 626 these are that aaron and moses to whom the lord said bring out the children of israel from the land of egypt according to their armies 627 these are they which spake to pharaoh king of egypt to bring out the children of israel from egypt these are that moses and aaron 628 and it came to pass on the day when the lord spake unto moses in the land of egypt 629 that the lord spake unto moses saying i am the lord speak thou unto pharaoh king of egypt all that i say unto thee 630 and moses said before the lord behold i am of uncircumcised lips and how shall pharaoh hearken unto me 71 and the lord said unto moses see i have made thee a god to pharaoh and aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet 72 thou shalt speak all that i command thee and aaron thy brother shall speak unto pharaoh that he send the children of israel out of his land 73 and i will harden pharaohs heart and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of egypt 74 but pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that i may lay my hand upon egypt and bring forth mine armies and my people the children of israel out of the land of egypt by great judgments 75 and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i stretch forth mine hand upon egypt and bring out the children of israel from among them 76 and moses and aaron did as the lord commanded them so did they 77 and moses was fourscore years old and aaron fourscore and three years old when they spake unto pharaoh 78 and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying 79 when pharaoh shall speak unto you saying shew a miracle for you then thou shalt say unto aaron take thy rod and cast it before pharaoh and it shall become a serpent 710 and moses and aaron went in unto pharaoh and they did so as the lord had commanded and aaron cast down his rod before pharaoh and before his servants and it became a serpent 711 then pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers now the magicians of egypt they also did in like manner with their enchantments 712 for they cast down every man his rod and they became serpents but aarons rod swallowed up their rods 713 and he hardened pharaohs heart that he hearkened not unto them as the lord had said 714 and the lord said unto moses pharaohs heart is hardened he refuseth to let the people go 715 get thee unto pharaoh in the morning lo he goeth out unto the water and thou shalt stand by the rivers brink against he come and the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand 716 and thou shalt say unto him the lord god of the hebrews hath sent me unto thee saying let my people go that they may serve me in the wilderness and behold hitherto thou wouldest not hear 717 thus saith the lord in this thou shalt know that i am the lord behold i will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters which are in the river and they shall be turned to blood 718 and the fish that is in the river shall die and the river shall stink and the egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the river 719 and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron take thy rod and stretch out thine hand upon the waters of egypt upon their streams upon their rivers and upon their ponds and upon all their pools of water that they may become blood and that there may be blood throughout all the land of egypt both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone 720 and moses and aaron did so as the lord commanded and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river in the sight of pharaoh and in the sight of his servants and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood 721 and the fish that was in the river died and the river stank and the egyptians could not drink of the water of the river and there was blood throughout all the land of egypt 722 and the magicians of egypt did so with their enchantments and pharaohs heart was hardened neither did he hearken unto them as the lord had said 723 and pharaoh turned and went into his house neither did he set his heart to this also 724 and all the egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink for they could not drink of the water of the river 725 and seven days were fulfilled after that the lord had smitten the river 81 and the lord spake unto moses go unto pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me 82 and if thou refuse to let them go behold i will smite all thy borders with frogs 83 and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up and come into thine house and into thy bedchamber and upon thy bed and into the house of thy servants and upon thy people and into thine ovens and into thy kneadingtroughs 84 and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants 85 and the lord spake unto moses say unto aaron stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams over the rivers and over the ponds and cause frogs to come up upon the land of egypt 86 and aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of egypt 87 and the magicians did so with their enchantments and brought up frogs upon the land of egypt 88 then pharaoh called for moses and aaron and said intreat the lord that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people and i will let the people go that they may do sacrifice unto the lord 89 and moses said unto pharaoh glory over me when shall i intreat for thee and for thy servants and for thy people to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses that they may remain in the river only 810 and he said to morrow and he said be it according to thy word that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the lord our god 811 and the frogs shall depart from thee and from thy houses and from thy servants and from thy people they shall remain in the river only 812 and moses and aaron went out from pharaoh and moses cried unto the lord because of the frogs which he had brought against pharaoh 813 and the lord did according to the word of moses and the frogs died out of the houses out of the villages and out of the fields 814 and they gathered them together upon heaps and the land stank 815 but when pharaoh saw that there was respite he hardened his heart and hearkened not unto them as the lord had said 816 and the lord said unto moses say unto aaron stretch out thy rod and smite the dust of the land that it may become lice throughout all the land of egypt 817 and they did so for aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth and it became lice in man and in beast all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of egypt 818 and the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice but they could not so there were lice upon man and upon beast 819 then the magicians said unto pharaoh this is the finger of god and pharaohs heart was hardened and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had said 820 and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh lo he cometh forth to the water and say unto him thus saith the lord let my people go that they may serve me 821 else if thou wilt not let my people go behold i will send swarms of flies upon thee and upon thy servants and upon thy people and into thy houses and the houses of the egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies and also the ground whereon they are 822 and i will sever in that day the land of goshen in which my people dwell that no swarms of flies shall be there to the end thou mayest know that i am the lord in the midst of the earth 823 and i will put a division between my people and thy people to morrow shall this sign be 824 and the lord did so and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of pharaoh and into his servants houses and into all the land of egypt the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies 825 and pharaoh called for moses and for aaron and said go ye sacrifice to your god in the land 826 and moses said it is not meet so to do for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians to the lord our god lo shall we sacrifice the abomination of the egyptians before their eyes and will they not stone us 827 we will go three days journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the lord our god as he shall command us 828 and pharaoh said i will let you go that ye may sacrifice to the lord your god in the wilderness only ye shall not go very far away intreat for me 829 and moses said behold i go out from thee and i will intreat the lord that the swarms of flies may depart from pharaoh from his servants and from his people to morrow but let not pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the lord 830 and moses went out from pharaoh and intreated the lord 831 and the lord did according to the word of moses and he removed the swarms of flies from pharaoh from his servants and from his people there remained not one 832 and pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also neither would he let the people go 91 then the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh and tell him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me 92 for if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still 93 behold the hand of the lord is upon thy cattle which is in the field upon the horses upon the asses upon the camels upon the oxen and upon the sheep there shall be a very grievous murrain 94 and the lord shall sever between the cattle of israel and the cattle of egypt and there shall nothing die of all that is the childrens of israel 95 and the lord appointed a set time saying to morrow the lord shall do this thing in the land 96 and the lord did that thing on the morrow and all the cattle of egypt died but of the cattle of the children of israel died not one 97 and pharaoh sent and behold there was not one of the cattle of the israelites dead and the heart of pharaoh was hardened and he did not let the people go 98 and the lord said unto moses and unto aaron take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace and let moses sprinkle it toward the heaven in the sight of pharaoh 99 and it shall become small dust in all the land of egypt and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast throughout all the land of egypt 910 and they took ashes of the furnace and stood before pharaoh and moses sprinkled it up toward heaven and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man and upon beast 911 and the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils for the boil was upon the magicians and upon all the egyptians 912 and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh and he hearkened not unto them as the lord had spoken unto moses 913 and the lord said unto moses rise up early in the morning and stand before pharaoh and say unto him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews let my people go that they may serve me 914 for i will at this time send all my plagues upon thine heart and upon thy servants and upon thy people that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth 915 for now i will stretch out my hand that i may smite thee and thy people with pestilence and thou shalt be cut off from the earth 916 and in very deed for this cause have i raised thee up for to shew in thee my power and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth 917 as yet exaltest thou thyself against my people that thou wilt not let them go 918 behold to morrow about this time i will cause it to rain a very grievous hail such as hath not been in egypt since the foundation thereof even until now 919 send therefore now and gather thy cattle and all that thou hast in the field for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home the hail shall come down upon them and they shall die 920 he that feared the word of the lord among the servants of pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses 921 and he that regarded not the word of the lord left his servants and his cattle in the field 922 and the lord said unto moses stretch forth thine hand toward heaven that there may be hail in all the land of egypt upon man and upon beast and upon every herb of the field throughout the land of egypt 923 and moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven and the lord sent thunder and hail and the fire ran along upon the ground and the lord rained hail upon the land of egypt 924 so there was hail and fire mingled with the hail very grievous such as there was none like it in all the land of egypt since it became a nation 925 and the hail smote throughout all the land of egypt all that was in the field both man and beast and the hail smote every herb of the field and brake every tree of the field 926 only in the land of goshen where the children of israel were was there no hail 927 and pharaoh sent and called for moses and aaron and said unto them i have sinned this time the lord is righteous and i and my people are wicked 928 intreat the lord for it is enough that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail and i will let you go and ye shall stay no longer 929 and moses said unto him as soon as i am gone out of the city i will spread abroad my hands unto the lord and the thunder shall cease neither shall there be any more hail that thou mayest know how that the earth is the lords 930 but as for thee and thy servants i know that ye will not yet fear the lord god 931 and the flax and the barley was smitten for the barley was in the ear and the flax was bolled 932 but the wheat and the rie were not smitten for they were not grown up 933 and moses went out of the city from pharaoh and spread abroad his hands unto the lord and the thunders and hail ceased and the rain was not poured upon the earth 934 and when pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased he sinned yet more and hardened his heart he and his servants 935 and the heart of pharaoh was hardened neither would he let the children of israel go as the lord had spoken by moses 101 and the lord said unto moses go in unto pharaoh for i have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants that i might shew these my signs before him 102 and that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son and of thy sons son what things i have wrought in egypt and my signs which i have done among them that ye may know how that i am the lord 103 and moses and aaron came in unto pharaoh and said unto him thus saith the lord god of the hebrews how long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me let my people go that they may serve me 104 else if thou refuse to let my people go behold to morrow will i bring the locusts into thy coast 105 and they shall cover the face of the earth that one cannot be able to see the earth and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped which remaineth unto you from the hail and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field 106 and they shall fill thy houses and the houses of all thy servants and the houses of all the egyptians which neither thy fathers nor thy fathers fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day and he turned himself and went out from pharaoh 107 and pharaohs servants said unto him how long shall this man be a snare unto us let the men go that they may serve the lord their god knowest thou not yet that egypt is destroyed 108 and moses and aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them go serve the lord your god but who are they that shall go 109 and moses said we will go with our young and with our old with our sons and with our daughters with our flocks and with our herds will we go for we must hold a feast unto the lord 1010 and he said unto them let the lord be so with you as i will let you go and your little ones look to it for evil is before you 1011 not so go now ye that are men and serve the lord for that ye did desire and they were driven out from pharaohs presence 1012 and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over the land of egypt for the locusts that they may come up upon the land of egypt and eat every herb of the land even all that the hail hath left 1013 and moses stretched forth his rod over the land of egypt and the lord brought an east wind upon the land all that day and all that night and when it was morning the east wind brought the locusts 1014 and the locust went up over all the land of egypt and rested in all the coasts of egypt very grievous were they before them there were no such locusts as they neither after them shall be such 1015 for they covered the face of the whole earth so that the land was darkened and they did eat every herb of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left and there remained not any green thing in the trees or in the herbs of the field through all the land of egypt 1016 then pharaoh called for moses and aaron in haste and he said i have sinned against the lord your god and against you 1017 now therefore forgive i pray thee my sin only this once and intreat the lord your god that he may take away from me this death only 1018 and he went out from pharaoh and intreated the lord 1019 and the lord turned a mighty strong west wind which took away the locusts and cast them into the red sea there remained not one locust in all the coasts of egypt 1020 but the lord hardened pharaohs heart so that he would not let the children of israel go 1021 and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand toward heaven that there may be darkness over the land of egypt even darkness which may be felt 1022 and moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven and there was a thick darkness in all the land of egypt three days 1023 they saw not one another neither rose any from his place for three days but all the children of israel had light in their dwellings 1024 and pharaoh called unto moses and said go ye serve the lord only let your flocks and your herds be stayed let your little ones also go with you 1025 and moses said thou must give us also sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice unto the lord our god 1026 our cattle also shall go with us there shall not an hoof be left behind for thereof must we take to serve the lord our god and we know not with what we must serve the lord until we come thither 1027 but the lord hardened pharaohs heart and he would not let them go 1028 and pharaoh said unto him get thee from me take heed to thyself see my face no more for in that day thou seest my face thou shalt die 1029 and moses said thou hast spoken well i will see thy face again no more 111 and the lord said unto moses yet will i bring one plague more upon pharaoh and upon egypt afterwards he will let you go hence when he shall let you go he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether 112 speak now in the ears of the people and let every man borrow of his neighbour and every woman of her neighbour jewels of silver and jewels of gold 113 and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians moreover the man moses was very great in the land of egypt in the sight of pharaohs servants and in the sight of the people 114 and moses said thus saith the lord about midnight will i go out into the midst of egypt 115 and all the firstborn in the land of egypt shall die from the first born of pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill and all the firstborn of beasts 116 and there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of egypt such as there was none like it nor shall be like it any more 117 but against any of the children of israel shall not a dog move his tongue against man or beast that ye may know how that the lord doth put a difference between the egyptians and israel 118 and all these thy servants shall come down unto me and bow down themselves unto me saying get thee out and all the people that follow thee and after that i will go out and he went out from pharaoh in a great anger 119 and the lord said unto moses pharaoh shall not hearken unto you that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of egypt 1110 and moses and aaron did all these wonders before pharaoh and the lord hardened pharaohs heart so that he would not let the children of israel go out of his land 121 and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in the land of egypt saying 122 this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you 123 speak ye unto all the congregation of israel saying in the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb according to the house of their fathers a lamb for an house 124 and if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb 125 your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year ye shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats 126 and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole assembly of the congregation of israel shall kill it in the evening 127 and they shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses wherein they shall eat it 128 and they shall eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it 129 eat not of it raw nor sodden at all with water but roast with fire his head with his legs and with the purtenance thereof 1210 and ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire 1211 and thus shall ye eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet and your staff in your hand and ye shall eat it in haste it is the lords passover 1212 for i will pass through the land of egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord 1213 and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the land of egypt 1214 and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and ye shall keep it a feast to the lord throughout your generations ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever 1215 seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses for whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day that soul shall be cut off from israel 1216 and in the first day there shall be an holy convocation and in the seventh day there shall be an holy convocation to you no manner of work shall be done in them save that which every man must eat that only may be done of you 1217 and ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread for in this selfsame day have i brought your armies out of the land of egypt therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever 1218 in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month at even ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and twentieth day of the month at even 1219 seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses for whosoever eateth that which is leavened even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of israel whether he be a stranger or born in the land 1220 ye shall eat nothing leavened in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread 1221 then moses called for all the elders of israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the passover 1222 and ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the bason and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning 1223 for the lord will pass through to smite the egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel and on the two side posts the lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you 1224 and ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever 1225 and it shall come to pass when ye be come to the land which the lord will give you according as he hath promised that ye shall keep this service 1226 and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you what mean ye by this service 1227 that ye shall say it is the sacrifice of the lords passover who passed over the houses of the children of israel in egypt when he smote the egyptians and delivered our houses and the people bowed the head and worshipped 1228 and the children of israel went away and did as the lord had commanded moses and aaron so did they 1229 and it came to pass that at midnight the lord smote all the firstborn in the land of egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon and all the firstborn of cattle 1230 and pharaoh rose up in the night he and all his servants and all the egyptians and there was a great cry in egypt for there was not a house where there was not one dead 1231 and he called for moses and aaron by night and said rise up and get you forth from among my people both ye and the children of israel and go serve the lord as ye have said 1232 also take your flocks and your herds as ye have said and be gone and bless me also 1233 and the egyptians were urgent upon the people that they might send them out of the land in haste for they said we be all dead men 1234 and the people took their dough before it was leavened their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders 1235 and the children of israel did according to the word of moses and they borrowed of the egyptians jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment 1236 and the lord gave the people favour in the sight of the egyptians so that they lent unto them such things as they required and they spoiled the egyptians 1237 and the children of israel journeyed from rameses to succoth about six hundred thousand on foot that were men beside children 1238 and a mixed multitude went up also with them and flocks and herds even very much cattle 1239 and they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of egypt for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of egypt and could not tarry neither had they prepared for themselves any victual 1240 now the sojourning of the children of israel who dwelt in egypt was four hundred and thirty years 1241 and it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years even the selfsame day it came to pass that all the hosts of the lord went out from the land of egypt 1242 it is a night to be much observed unto the lord for bringing them out from the land of egypt this is that night of the lord to be observed of all the children of israel in their generations 1243 and the lord said unto moses and aaron this is the ordinance of the passover there shall no stranger eat thereof 1244 but every mans servant that is bought for money when thou hast circumcised him then shall he eat thereof 1245 a foreigner and an hired servant shall not eat thereof 1246 in one house shall it be eaten thou shalt not carry forth ought of the flesh abroad out of the house neither shall ye break a bone thereof 1247 all the congregation of israel shall keep it 1248 and when a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep the passover to the lord let all his males be circumcised and then let him come near and keep it and he shall be as one that is born in the land for no uncircumcised person shall eat thereof 1249 one law shall be to him that is homeborn and unto the stranger that sojourneth among you 1250 thus did all the children of israel as the lord commanded moses and aaron so did they 1251 and it came to pass the selfsame day that the lord did bring the children of israel out of the land of egypt by their armies 131 and the lord spake unto moses saying 132 sanctify unto me all the firstborn whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of israel both of man and of beast it is mine 133 and moses said unto the people remember this day in which ye came out from egypt out of the house of bondage for by strength of hand the lord brought you out from this place there shall no leavened bread be eaten 134 this day came ye out in the month abib 135 and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the hivites and the jebusites which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee a land flowing with milk and honey that thou shalt keep this service in this month 136 seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the lord 137 unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters 138 and thou shalt shew thy son in that day saying this is done because of that which the lord did unto me when i came forth out of egypt 139 and it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand and for a memorial between thine eyes that the lords law may be in thy mouth for with a strong hand hath the lord brought thee out of egypt 1310 thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in his season from year to year 1311 and it shall be when the lord shall bring thee into the land of the canaanites as he sware unto thee and to thy fathers and shall give it thee 1312 that thou shalt set apart unto the lord all that openeth the matrix and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast the males shall be the lords 1313 and every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou wilt not redeem it then thou shalt break his neck and all the firstborn of man among thy children shalt thou redeem 1314 and it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what is this that thou shalt say unto him by strength of hand the lord brought us out from egypt from the house of bondage 1315 and it came to pass when pharaoh would hardly let us go that the lord slew all the firstborn in the land of egypt both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of beast therefore i sacrifice to the lord all that openeth the matrix being males but all the firstborn of my children i redeem 1316 and it shall be for a token upon thine hand and for frontlets between thine eyes for by strength of hand the lord brought us forth out of egypt 1317 and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go that god led them not through the way of the land of the philistines although that was near for god said lest peradventure the people repent when they see war and they return to egypt 1318 but god led the people about through the way of the wilderness of the red sea and the children of israel went up harnessed out of the land of egypt 1319 and moses took the bones of joseph with him for he had straitly sworn the children of israel saying god will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you 1320 and they took their journey from succoth and encamped in etham in the edge of the wilderness 1321 and the lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light to go by day and night 1322 he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people 141 and the lord spake unto moses saying 142 speak unto the children of israel that they turn and encamp before pihahiroth between migdol and the sea over against baalzephon before it shall ye encamp by the sea 143 for pharaoh will say of the children of israel they are entangled in the land the wilderness hath shut them in 144 and i will harden pharaohs heart that he shall follow after them and i will be honoured upon pharaoh and upon all his host that the egyptians may know that i am the lord and they did so 145 and it was told the king of egypt that the people fled and the heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people and they said why have we done this that we have let israel go from serving us 146 and he made ready his chariot and took his people with him 147 and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of egypt and captains over every one of them 148 and the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt and he pursued after the children of israel and the children of israel went out with an high hand 149 but the egyptians pursued after them all the horses and chariots of pharaoh and his horsemen and his army and overtook them encamping by the sea beside pihahiroth before baalzephon 1410 and when pharaoh drew nigh the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord 1411 and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of egypt 1412 is not this the word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness 1413 and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will shew to you to day for the egyptians whom ye have seen to day ye shall see them again no more for ever 1414 the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace 1415 and the lord said unto moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward 1416 but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea 1417 and i behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians and they shall follow them and i will get me honour upon pharaoh and upon all his host upon his chariots and upon his horsemen 1418 and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i have gotten me honour upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his horsemen 1419 and the angel of god which went before the camp of israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them 1420 and it came between the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that the one came not near the other all the night 1421 and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided 1422 and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left 1423 and the egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea even all pharaohs horses his chariots and his horsemen 1424 and it came to pass that in the morning watch the lord looked unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and troubled the host of the egyptians 1425 and took off their chariot wheels that they drave them heavily so that the egyptians said let us flee from the face of israel for the lord fighteth for them against the egyptians 1426 and the lord said unto moses stretch out thine hand over the sea that the waters may come again upon the egyptians upon their chariots and upon their horsemen 1427 and moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the egyptians fled against it and the lord overthrew the egyptians in the midst of the sea 1428 and the waters returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of pharaoh that came into the sea after them there remained not so much as one of them 1429 but the children of israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left 1430 thus the lord saved israel that day out of the hand of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians dead upon the sea shore 1431 and israel saw that great work which the lord did upon the egyptians and the people feared the lord and believed the lord and his servant moses 151 then sang moses and the children of israel this song unto the lord and spake saying i will sing unto the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea 152 the lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvation he is my god and i will prepare him an habitation my fathers god and i will exalt him 153 the lord is a man of war the lord is his name 154 pharaohs chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea his chosen captains also are drowned in the red sea 155 the depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a stone 156 thy right hand o lord is become glorious in power thy right hand o lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy 157 and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sentest forth thy wrath which consumed them as stubble 158 and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together the floods stood upright as an heap and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea 159 the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them 1510 thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in the mighty waters 1511 who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders 1512 thou stretchedst out thy right hand the earth swallowed them 1513 thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation 1514 the people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of palestina 1515 then the dukes of edom shall be amazed the mighty men of moab trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaan shall melt away 1516 fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone till thy people pass over o lord till the people pass over which thou hast purchased 1517 thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance in the place o lord which thou hast made for thee to dwell in in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands have established 1518 the lord shall reign for ever and ever 1519 for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea and the lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them but the children of israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea 1520 and miriam the prophetess the sister of aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances 1521 and miriam answered them sing ye to the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea 1522 so moses brought israel from the red sea and they went out into the wilderness of shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water 1523 and when they came to marah they could not drink of the waters of marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called marah 1524 and the people murmured against moses saying what shall we drink 1525 and he cried unto the lord and the lord shewed him a tree which when he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet there he made for them a statute and an ordinance and there he proved them 1526 and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the lord thy god and wilt do that which is right in his sight and wilt give ear to his commandments and keep all his statutes i will put none of these diseases upon thee which i have brought upon the egyptians for i am the lord that healeth thee 1527 and they came to elim where were twelve wells of water and threescore and ten palm trees and they encamped there by the waters 161 and they took their journey from elim and all the congregation of the children of israel came unto the wilderness of sin which is between elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of egypt 162 and the whole congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and aaron in the wilderness 163 and the children of israel said unto them would to god we had died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger 164 then said the lord unto moses behold i will rain bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day that i may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no 165 and it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily 166 and moses and aaron said unto all the children of israel at even then ye shall know that the lord hath brought you out from the land of egypt 167 and in the morning then ye shall see the glory of the lord for that he heareth your murmurings against the lord and what are we that ye murmur against us 168 and moses said this shall be when the lord shall give you in the evening flesh to eat and in the morning bread to the full for that the lord heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him and what are we your murmurings are not against us but against the lord 169 and moses spake unto aaron say unto all the congregation of the children of israel come near before the lord for he hath heard your murmurings 1610 and it came to pass as aaron spake unto the whole congregation of the children of israel that they looked toward the wilderness and behold the glory of the lord appeared in the cloud 1611 and the lord spake unto moses saying 1612 i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel speak unto them saying at even ye shall eat flesh and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread and ye shall know that i am the lord your god 1613 and it came to pass that at even the quails came up and covered the camp and in the morning the dew lay round about the host 1614 and when the dew that lay was gone up behold upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing as small as the hoar frost on the ground 1615 and when the children of israel saw it they said one to another it is manna for they wist not what it was and moses said unto them this is the bread which the lord hath given you to eat 1616 this is the thing which the lord hath commanded gather of it every man according to his eating an omer for every man according to the number of your persons take ye every man for them which are in his tents 1617 and the children of israel did so and gathered some more some less 1618 and when they did mete it with an omer he that gathered much had nothing over and he that gathered little had no lack they gathered every man according to his eating 1619 and moses said let no man leave of it till the morning 1620 notwithstanding they hearkened not unto moses but some of them left of it until the morning and it bred worms and stank and moses was wroth with them 1621 and they gathered it every morning every man according to his eating and when the sun waxed hot it melted 1622 and it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two omers for one man and all the rulers of the congregation came and told moses 1623 and he said unto them this is that which the lord hath said to morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the lord bake that which ye will bake to day and seethe that ye will seethe and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning 1624 and they laid it up till the morning as moses bade and it did not stink neither was there any worm therein 1625 and moses said eat that to day for to day is a sabbath unto the lord to day ye shall not find it in the field 1626 six days ye shall gather it but on the seventh day which is the sabbath in it there shall be none 1627 and it came to pass that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather and they found none 1628 and the lord said unto moses how long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws 1629 see for that the lord hath given you the sabbath therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days abide ye every man in his place let no man go out of his place on the seventh day 1630 so the people rested on the seventh day 1631 and the house of israel called the name thereof manna and it was like coriander seed white and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey 1632 and moses said this is the thing which the lord commandeth fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations that they may see the bread wherewith i have fed you in the wilderness when i brought you forth from the land of egypt 1633 and moses said unto aaron take a pot and put an omer full of manna therein and lay it up before the lord to be kept for your generations 1634 as the lord commanded moses so aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept 1635 and the children of israel did eat manna forty years until they came to a land inhabited they did eat manna until they came unto the borders of the land of canaan 1636 now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah 171 and all the congregation of the children of israel journeyed from the wilderness of sin after their journeys according to the commandment of the lord and pitched in rephidim and there was no water for the people to drink 172 wherefore the people did chide with moses and said give us water that we may drink and moses said unto them why chide ye with me wherefore do ye tempt the lord 173 and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against moses and said wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst 174 and moses cried unto the lord saying what shall i do unto this people they be almost ready to stone me 175 and the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of israel and thy rod wherewith thou smotest the river take in thine hand and go 176 behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and moses did so in the sight of the elders of israel 177 and he called the name of the place massah and meribah because of the chiding of the children of israel and because they tempted the lord saying is the lord among us or not 178 then came amalek and fought with israel in rephidim 179 and moses said unto joshua choose us out men and go out fight with amalek to morrow i will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of god in mine hand 1710 so joshua did as moses had said to him and fought with amalek and moses aaron and hur went up to the top of the hill 1711 and it came to pass when moses held up his hand that israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalek prevailed 1712 but moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat thereon and aaron and hur stayed up his hands the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun 1713 and joshua discomfited amalek and his people with the edge of the sword 1714 and the lord said unto moses write this for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of joshua for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven 1715 and moses built an altar and called the name of it jehovahnissi 1716 for he said because the lord hath sworn that the lord will have war with amalek from generation to generation 181 when jethro the priest of midian moses father in law heard of all that god had done for moses and for israel his people and that the lord had brought israel out of egypt 182 then jethro moses father in law took zipporah moses wife after he had sent her back 183 and her two sons of which the name of the one was gershom for he said i have been an alien in a strange land 184 and the name of the other was eliezer for the god of my father said he was mine help and delivered me from the sword of pharaoh 185 and jethro moses father in law came with his sons and his wife unto moses into the wilderness where he encamped at the mount of god 186 and he said unto moses i thy father in law jethro am come unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with her 187 and moses went out to meet his father in law and did obeisance and kissed him and they asked each other of their welfare and they came into the tent 188 and moses told his father in law all that the lord had done unto pharaoh and to the egyptians for israels sake and all the travail that had come upon them by the way and how the lord delivered them 189 and jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the lord had done to israel whom he had delivered out of the hand of the egyptians 1810 and jethro said blessed be the lord who hath delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of pharaoh who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the egyptians 1811 now i know that the lord is greater than all gods for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them 1812 and jethro moses father in law took a burnt offering and sacrifices for god and aaron came and all the elders of israel to eat bread with moses father in law before god 1813 and it came to pass on the morrow that moses sat to judge the people and the people stood by moses from the morning unto the evening 1814 and when moses father in law saw all that he did to the people he said what is this thing that thou doest to the people why sittest thou thyself alone and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even 1815 and moses said unto his father in law because the people come unto me to enquire of god 1816 when they have a matter they come unto me and i judge between one and another and i do make them know the statutes of god and his laws 1817 and moses father in law said unto him the thing that thou doest is not good 1818 thou wilt surely wear away both thou and this people that is with thee for this thing is too heavy for thee thou art not able to perform it thyself alone 1819 hearken now unto my voice i will give thee counsel and god shall be with thee be thou for the people to godward that thou mayest bring the causes unto god 1820 and thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws and shalt shew them the way wherein they must walk and the work that they must do 1821 moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men such as fear god men of truth hating covetousness and place such over them to be rulers of thousands and rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens 1822 and let them judge the people at all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee but every small matter they shall judge so shall it be easier for thyself and they shall bear the burden with thee 1823 if thou shalt do this thing and god command thee so then thou shalt be able to endure and all this people shall also go to their place in peace 1824 so moses hearkened to the voice of his father in law and did all that he had said 1825 and moses chose able men out of all israel and made them heads over the people rulers of thousands rulers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of tens 1826 and they judged the people at all seasons the hard causes they brought unto moses but every small matter they judged themselves 1827 and moses let his father in law depart and he went his way into his own land 191 in the third month when the children of israel were gone forth out of the land of egypt the same day came they into the wilderness of sinai 192 for they were departed from rephidim and were come to the desert of sinai and had pitched in the wilderness and there israel camped before the mount 193 and moses went up unto god and the lord called unto him out of the mountain saying thus shalt thou say to the house of jacob and tell the children of israel 194 ye have seen what i did unto the egyptians and how i bare you on eagles wings and brought you unto myself 195 now therefore if ye will obey my voice indeed and keep my covenant then ye shall be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the earth is mine 196 and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and an holy nation these are the words which thou shalt speak unto the children of israel 197 and moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the lord commanded him 198 and all the people answered together and said all that the lord hath spoken we will do and moses returned the words of the people unto the lord 199 and the lord said unto moses lo i come unto thee in a thick cloud that the people may hear when i speak with thee and believe thee for ever and moses told the words of the people unto the lord 1910 and the lord said unto moses go unto the people and sanctify them to day and to morrow and let them wash their clothes 1911 and be ready against the third day for the third day the lord will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount sinai 1912 and thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about saying take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death 1913 there shall not an hand touch it but he shall surely be stoned or shot through whether it be beast or man it shall not live when the trumpet soundeth long they shall come up to the mount 1914 and moses went down from the mount unto the people and sanctified the people and they washed their clothes 1915 and he said unto the people be ready against the third day come not at your wives 1916 and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that was in the camp trembled 1917 and moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with god and they stood at the nether part of the mount 1918 and mount sinai was altogether on a smoke because the lord descended upon it in fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mount quaked greatly 1919 and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and waxed louder and louder moses spake and god answered him by a voice 1920 and the lord came down upon mount sinai on the top of the mount and the lord called moses up to the top of the mount and moses went up 1921 and the lord said unto moses go down charge the people lest they break through unto the lord to gaze and many of them perish 1922 and let the priests also which come near to the lord sanctify themselves lest the lord break forth upon them 1923 and moses said unto the lord the people cannot come up to mount sinai for thou chargedst us saying set bounds about the mount and sanctify it 1924 and the lord said unto him away get thee down and thou shalt come up thou and aaron with thee but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the lord lest he break forth upon them 1925 so moses went down unto the people and spake unto them 201 and god spake all these words saying 202 i am the lord thy god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage 203 thou shalt have no other gods before me 204 thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth 205 thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me 206 and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments 207 thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain 208 remember the sabbath day to keep it holy 209 six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work 2010 but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates 2011 for in six days the lord made heaven and earth the sea and all that in them is and rested the seventh day wherefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it 2012 honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee 2013 thou shalt not kill 2014 thou shalt not commit adultery 2015 thou shalt not steal 2016 thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour 2017 thou shalt not covet thy neighbours house thou shalt not covet thy neighbours wife nor his manservant nor his maidservant nor his ox nor his ass nor any thing that is thy neighbours 2018 and all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afar off 2019 and they said unto moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not god speak with us lest we die 2020 and moses said unto the people fear not for god is come to prove you and that his fear may be before your faces that ye sin not 2021 and the people stood afar off and moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god was 2022 and the lord said unto moses thus thou shalt say unto the children of israel ye have seen that i have talked with you from heaven 2023 ye shall not make with me gods of silver neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold 2024 an altar of earth thou shalt make unto me and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings thy sheep and thine oxen in all places where i record my name i will come unto thee and i will bless thee 2025 and if thou wilt make me an altar of stone thou shalt not build it of hewn stone for if thou lift up thy tool upon it thou hast polluted it 2026 neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon 211 now these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them 212 if thou buy an hebrew servant six years he shall serve and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing 213 if he came in by himself he shall go out by himself if he were married then his wife shall go out with him 214 if his master have given him a wife and she have born him sons or daughters the wife and her children shall be her masters and he shall go out by himself 215 and if the servant shall plainly say i love my master my wife and my children i will not go out free 216 then his master shall bring him unto the judges he shall also bring him to the door or unto the door post and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul and he shall serve him for ever 217 and if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant she shall not go out as the menservants do 218 if she please not her master who hath betrothed her to himself then shall he let her be redeemed to sell her unto a strange nation he shall have no power seeing he hath dealt deceitfully with her 219 and if he have betrothed her unto his son he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters 2110 if he take him another wife her food her raiment and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish 2111 and if he do not these three unto her then shall she go out free without money 2112 he that smiteth a man so that he die shall be surely put to death 2113 and if a man lie not in wait but god deliver him into his hand then i will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee 2114 but if a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour to slay him with guile thou shalt take him from mine altar that he may die 2115 and he that smiteth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death 2116 and he that stealeth a man and selleth him or if he be found in his hand he shall surely be put to death 2117 and he that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death 2118 and if men strive together and one smite another with a stone or with his fist and he die not but keepeth his bed 2119 if he rise again and walk abroad upon his staff then shall he that smote him be quit only he shall pay for the loss of his time and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed 2120 and if a man smite his servant or his maid with a rod and he die under his hand he shall be surely punished 2121 notwithstanding if he continue a day or two he shall not be punished for he is his money 2122 if men strive and hurt a woman with child so that her fruit depart from her and yet no mischief follow he shall be surely punished according as the womans husband will lay upon him and he shall pay as the judges determine 2123 and if any mischief follow then thou shalt give life for life 2124 eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot 2125 burning for burning wound for wound stripe for stripe 2126 and if a man smite the eye of his servant or the eye of his maid that it perish he shall let him go free for his eyes sake 2127 and if he smite out his manservants tooth or his maidservants tooth he shall let him go free for his tooths sake 2128 if an ox gore a man or a woman that they die then the ox shall be surely stoned and his flesh shall not be eaten but the owner of the ox shall be quit 2129 but if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past and it hath been testified to his owner and he hath not kept him in but that he hath killed a man or a woman the ox shall be stoned and his owner also shall be put to death 2130 if there be laid on him a sum of money then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatsoever is laid upon him 2131 whether he have gored a son or have gored a daughter according to this judgment shall it be done unto him 2132 if the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver and the ox shall be stoned 2133 and if a man shall open a pit or if a man shall dig a pit and not cover it and an ox or an ass fall therein 2134 the owner of the pit shall make it good and give money unto the owner of them and the dead beast shall be his 2135 and if one mans ox hurt anothers that he die then they shall sell the live ox and divide the money of it and the dead ox also they shall divide 2136 or if it be known that the ox hath used to push in time past and his owner hath not kept him in he shall surely pay ox for ox and the dead shall be his own 221 if a man shall steal an ox or a sheep and kill it or sell it he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep 222 if a thief be found breaking up and be smitten that he die there shall no blood be shed for him 223 if the sun be risen upon him there shall be blood shed for him for he should make full restitution if he have nothing then he shall be sold for his theft 224 if the theft be certainly found in his hand alive whether it be ox or ass or sheep he shall restore double 225 if a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten and shall put in his beast and shall feed in another mans field of the best of his own field and of the best of his own vineyard shall he make restitution 226 if fire break out and catch in thorns so that the stacks of corn or the standing corn or the field be consumed therewith he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution 227 if a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep and it be stolen out of the mans house if the thief be found let him pay double 228 if the thief be not found then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges to see whether he have put his hand unto his neighbours goods 229 for all manner of trespass whether it be for ox for ass for sheep for raiment or for any manner of lost thing which another challengeth to be his the cause of both parties shall come before the judges and whom the judges shall condemn he shall pay double unto his neighbour 2210 if a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep and it die or be hurt or driven away no man seeing it 2211 then shall an oath of the lord be between them both that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbours goods and the owner of it shall accept thereof and he shall not make it good 2212 and if it be stolen from him he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof 2213 if it be torn in pieces then let him bring it for witness and he shall not make good that which was torn 2214 and if a man borrow ought of his neighbour and it be hurt or die the owner thereof being not with it he shall surely make it good 2215 but if the owner thereof be with it he shall not make it good if it be an hired thing it came for his hire 2216 and if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed and lie with her he shall surely endow her to be his wife 2217 if her father utterly refuse to give her unto him he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins 2218 thou shalt not suffer a witch to live 2219 whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death 2220 he that sacrificeth unto any god save unto the lord only he shall be utterly destroyed 2221 thou shalt neither vex a stranger nor oppress him for ye were strangers in the land of egypt 2222 ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child 2223 if thou afflict them in any wise and they cry at all unto me i will surely hear their cry 2224 and my wrath shall wax hot and i will kill you with the sword and your wives shall be widows and your children fatherless 2225 if thou lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee thou shalt not be to him as an usurer neither shalt thou lay upon him usury 2226 if thou at all take thy neighbours raiment to pledge thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down 2227 for that is his covering only it is his raiment for his skin wherein shall he sleep and it shall come to pass when he crieth unto me that i will hear for i am gracious 2228 thou shalt not revile the gods nor curse the ruler of thy people 2229 thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits and of thy liquors the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me 2230 likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen and with thy sheep seven days it shall be with his dam on the eighth day thou shalt give it me 2231 and ye shall be holy men unto me neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field ye shall cast it to the dogs 231 thou shalt not raise a false report put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness 232 thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil neither shalt thou speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment 233 neither shalt thou countenance a poor man in his cause 234 if thou meet thine enemys ox or his ass going astray thou shalt surely bring it back to him again 235 if thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden and wouldest forbear to help him thou shalt surely help with him 236 thou shalt not wrest the judgment of thy poor in his cause

words of the righteous 239 also thou shalt not oppress a stranger for ye know the heart of a stranger seeing ye were strangers in the land of egypt 2310 and six years thou shalt sow thy land and shalt gather in the fruits thereof 2311 but the seventh year thou shalt let it rest and lie still that the poor of thy people may eat and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat in like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard and with thy oliveyard 2312 six days thou shalt do thy work and on the seventh day thou shalt rest that thine ox and thine ass may rest and the son of thy handmaid and the stranger may be refreshed 2313 and in all things that i have said unto you be circumspect and make no mention of the name of other gods neither let it be heard out of thy mouth 2314 three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year 2315 thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days as i commanded thee in the time appointed of the month abib for in it thou camest out from egypt and none shall appear before me empty 2316 and the feast of harvest the firstfruits of thy labours which thou hast sown in the field and the feast of ingathering which is in the end of the year when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field 2317 three items in the year all thy males shall appear before the lord god 2318 thou shalt not

lord thy god thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mothers milk 2320 behold i send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which i have prepared 2321 beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him 2322 but if thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that i speak then i will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries 2323 for mine angel shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites and the hittites and the perizzites and the canaanites the hivites and the jebusites and i will cut them off 2324 thou shalt not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images

cassia five hundred shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary and of oil olive an hin 3025 and thou shalt make it an oil of holy ointment an ointment compound after the art of the apothecary it shall be an holy anointing oil 3026 and thou shalt anoint the tabernacle of the congregation therewith and the ark of the testimony 3027 and the table and all his vessels and the candlestick and his vessels and the altar of incense 3028 and the altar of burnt offering with all his vessels and the laver and his foot 3029 and thou shalt sanctify them that they may be most holy whatsoever toucheth them shall be holy 3030 and thou shalt anoint aaron and his sons and consecrate them that they may minister unto me in the priests office 3031 and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel saying this shall be an holy anointing oil unto me throughout your generations 3032 upon mans flesh shall it not be poured neither shall ye make any other like it after the composition of it it is holy and it shall be holy unto you 3033 whosoever compoundeth any like it or whosoever putteth any of it upon a stranger shall even be cut off from his people 3034 and the lord said unto moses take unto thee sweet spices stacte and onycha and galbanum these sweet spices with pure frankincense of each shall there be a like weight 3035 and thou shalt make it a perfume a confection after the art of the apothecary tempered together pure and holy 3036 and thou shalt beat some of it very small and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation where i will meet with thee it shall be unto you most holy 3037 and as for the perfume which thou shalt make ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof it shall be unto thee holy for the lord 3038 whosoever shall make like unto that to smell thereto shall even be cut off from his people 311 and the lord spake unto moses saying 312 see i have called by name bezaleel the son of uri the son of hur of the tribe of judah 313 and i have filled him with the spirit of god in wisdom and in understanding and in knowledge and in all manner of workmanship 314 to devise cunning works to work in gold and in silver and in brass 315 and in cutting of stones to set them and in carving of timber to work in all manner of workmanship 316 and i behold i have given with him aholiab the son of ahisamach of the tribe of dan and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted i have put wisdom that they may make all that i have commanded thee 317 the tabernacle of the congregation and the ark of the testimony and the mercy seat that is thereupon and all the furniture of the tabernacle 318 and the table and his furniture and the pure candlestick with all his furniture and the altar of incense 319 and the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture and the laver and his foot 3110 and the cloths of service and the holy garments for aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to minister in the priests office 3111 and the anointing oil and sweet incense for the holy place according to all that i have commanded thee shall they do 3112 and the lord spake unto moses saying 3113 speak thou also unto the children of israel saying verily my sabbaths ye shall keep for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations that ye may know that i am the lord that doth sanctify you 3114 ye shall keep the sabbath therefore for it is holy unto you every one that defileth it shall surely be put to death for whosoever doeth any work therein that soul shall be cut off from among his people 3115 six days may work be done but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest holy to the lord whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day he shall surely be put to death 3116 wherefore the children of israel shall keep the sabbath to observe the sabbath throughout their generations for a perpetual covenant 3117 it is a sign between me and the children of israel for ever for in six days the lord made heaven and earth and on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed 3118 and he gave unto moses when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount sinai two tables of testimony tables of stone written with the finger of god 321 and when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and said unto him up make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him 322 and aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters and bring them unto me 323 and all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto aaron 324 and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it a molten calf and they said these be thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt 325 and when aaron saw it he built an altar before it and aaron made proclamation and said to morrow is a feast to the lord 326 and they rose up early on the morrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play 327 and the lord said unto moses go get thee down for thy people which thou broughtest out of the land of egypt have corrupted themselves 328 they have turned aside quickly out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed thereunto and said these be thy gods o israel which have brought thee up out of the land of egypt 329 and the lord said unto moses i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people 3210 now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot against them and that i may consume them and i will make of thee a great nation 3211 and moses besought the lord his god and said lord why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people which thou hast brought forth out of the land of egypt with great power and with a mighty hand 3212 wherefore should the egyptians speak and say for mischief did he bring them out to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from the face of the earth turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of this evil against thy people 3213 remember abraham isaac and israel thy servants to whom thou swarest by thine own self and saidst unto them i will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and all this land that i have spoken of will i give unto your seed and they shall inherit it for ever 3214 and the lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people 3215 and moses turned and went down from the mount and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand the tables were written on both their sides on the one side and on the other were they written 3216 and the tables were the work of god and the writing was the writing of god graven upon the tables 3217 and when joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted he said unto moses there is a noise of war in the camp 3218 and he said it is not the voice of them that shout for mastery neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome but the noise of them that sing do i hear 3219 and it came to pass as soon as he came nigh unto the camp that he saw the calf and the dancing and moses anger waxed hot and he cast the tables out of his hands and brake them beneath the mount 3220 and he took the calf which they had made and burnt it in the fire and ground it to powder and strawed it upon the water and made the children of israel drink of it 3221 and moses said unto aaron what did this people unto thee that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them 3222 and aaron said let not the anger of my lord wax hot thou knowest the people that they are set on mischief 3223 for they said unto me make us gods which shall go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him 3224 and i said unto them whosoever hath any gold let them break it off so they gave it me then i cast it into the fire and there came out this calf 3225 and when moses saw that the people were naked for aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies 3226 then moses stood in the gate of the camp and said who is on the lords side let him come unto me and all the sons of levi gathered themselves together unto him 3227 and he said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel put every man his sword by his side and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp and slay every man his brother and every man his companion and every man his neighbour 3228 and the children of levi did according to the word of moses and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men 3229 for moses had said consecrate yourselves today to the lord even every man upon his son and upon his brother that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day 3230 and it came to pass on the morrow that moses said unto the people ye have sinned a great sin and now i will go up unto the lord peradventure i shall make an atonement for your sin 3231 and moses returned unto the lord and said oh this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold 3232 yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin and if not blot me i pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written 3233 and the lord said unto moses whosoever hath sinned against me him will i blot out of my book 3234 therefore now go lead the people unto the place of which i have spoken unto thee behold mine angel shall go before thee nevertheless in the day when i visit i will visit their sin upon them 3235 and the lord plagued the people because they made the calf which aaron made 331 and the lord said unto moses depart and go up hence thou and the people which thou hast brought up out of the land of egypt unto the land which i sware unto abraham to isaac and to jacob saying unto thy seed will i give it 332 and i will send an angel before thee and i will drive out the canaanite the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite 333 unto a land flowing with milk and honey for i will not go up in the midst of thee for thou art a stiffnecked people lest i consume thee in the way 334 and when the people heard these evil tidings they mourned and no man did put on him his ornaments 335 for the lord had said unto moses say unto the children of israel ye are a stiffnecked people i will come up into the midst of thee in a moment and consume thee therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee that i may know what to do unto thee 336 and the children of israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount horeb 337 and moses took the tabernacle and pitched it without the camp afar off from the camp and called it the tabernacle of the congregation and it came to pass that every one which sought the lord went out unto the tabernacle of the congregation which was without the camp 338 and it came to pass when moses went out unto the tabernacle that all the people rose up and stood every man at his tent door and looked after moses until he was gone into the tabernacle 339 and it came to pass as moses entered into the tabernacle the cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the tabernacle and the lord talked with moses 3310 and all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshipped every man in his tent door 3311 and the lord spake unto moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the tabernacle 3312 and moses said unto the lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me yet thou hast said i know thee by name and thou hast also found grace in my sight 3313 now therefore i pray thee if i have found grace in thy sight shew me now thy way that i may know thee that i may find grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people 3314 and he said my presence shall go with thee and i will give thee rest 3315 and he said unto him if thy presence go not with me carry us not up hence 3316 for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth 3317 and the lord said unto moses i will do this thing also that thou hast spoken for thou hast found grace in my sight and i know thee by name 3318 and he said i beseech thee shew me thy glory 3319 and he said i will make all my goodness pass before thee and i will proclaim the name of the lord before thee and will be gracious to whom i will be gracious and will shew mercy on whom i will shew mercy 3320 and he said thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and live 3321 and the lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock 3322 and it shall come to pass while my glory passeth by that i will put thee in a clift of the rock and will cover thee with my hand while i pass by 3323 and i will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall not be seen 341 and the lord said unto moses hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and i will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest 342 and be ready in the morning and come up in the morning unto mount sinai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount 343 and no man shall come up with thee neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount 344 and he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and moses rose up early in the morning and went up unto mount sinai as the lord had commanded him and took in his hand the two tables of stone 345 and the lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there and proclaimed the name of the lord 346 and the lord passed by before him and proclaimed the lord the lord god merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth 347 keeping mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the childrens children unto the third and to the fourth generation 348 and moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped 349 and he said if now i have found grace in thy sight o lord let my lord i pray thee go among us for it is a stiffnecked people and pardon our iniquity and our sin and take us for thine inheritance 3410 and he said behold i make a covenant before all thy people i will do marvels such as have not been done in all the earth nor in any nation and all the people among which thou art shall see the work of the lord for it is a terrible thing that i will do with thee 3411 observe thou that which i command thee this day behold i drive out before thee the amorite and the canaanite and the hittite and the perizzite and the hivite and the jebusite 3412 take heed to thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee 3413 but ye shall destroy their altars break their images and cut down their groves 3414 for thou shalt worship no other god for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god 3415 lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they go a whoring after their gods and do sacrifice unto their gods and one call thee and thou eat of his sacrifice 3416 and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons and their daughters go a whoring after their gods and make thy sons go a whoring after their gods 3417 thou shalt make thee no molten gods 3418 the feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread as i commanded thee in the time of the month abib for in the month abib thou camest out from egypt 3419 all that openeth the matrix is mine and every firstling among thy cattle whether ox or sheep that is male 3420 but the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb and if thou redeem him not then shalt thou break his neck all the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt redeem and none shall appear before me empty 3421 six days thou shalt work but on the seventh day thou shalt rest in earing time and in harvest thou shalt rest 3422 and thou shalt observe the feast of weeks of the firstfruits of wheat harvest and the feast of ingathering at the years end 3423 thrice in the year shall all your menchildren appear before the lord god the god of israel 3424 for i will cast out the nations before thee and enlarge thy borders neither shall any man desire thy land when thou shalt go up to appear before the lord thy god thrice in the year 3425 thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning 3426 the first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the lord thy god thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mothers milk 3427 and the lord said unto moses write thou these words for after the tenor of these words i have made a covenant with thee and with israel 3428 and he was there with the lord forty days and forty nights he did neither eat bread nor drink water and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant the ten commandments 3429 and it came to pass when moses came down from mount sinai with the two tables of testimony in moses hand when he came down from the mount that moses wist not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him 3430 and when aaron and all the children of israel saw moses behold the skin of his face shone and they were afraid to come nigh him 3431 and moses called unto them and aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned unto him and moses talked with them 3432 and afterward all the children of israel came nigh and he gave them in commandment all that the lord had spoken with him in mount sinai 3433 and till moses had done speaking with them he put a vail on his face 3434 but when moses went in before the lord to speak with him he took the vail off until he came out and he came out and spake unto the children of israel that which he was commanded 3435 and the children of israel saw the face of moses that the skin of moses face shone and moses put the vail upon his face again until he went in to speak with him 351 and moses gathered all the congregation of the children of israel together and said unto them these are the words which the lord hath commanded that ye should do them 352 six days shall work be done but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day a sabbath of rest to the lord whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death 353 ye shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations upon the sabbath day 354 and moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of israel saying this is the thing which the lord commanded saying 355 take ye from among you an offering unto the lord whosoever is of a willing heart let him bring it an offering of the lord gold and silver and brass 356 and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goats hair 357 and rams skins dyed red and badgers skins and shittim wood 358 and oil for the light and spices for anointing oil and for the sweet incense 359 and onyx stones and stones to

made by the hand of moses 3530 and moses said unto the children of israel see the lord hath called by name bezaleel the son of uri the son of hur of the tribe of judah 3531 and he hath filled him with

and a bullock for the sin offering and two rams and a basket of unleavened bread 83 and gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation 84 and moses did as the lord commanded him and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation 85 and moses said unto the congregation this is the thing which the lord commanded to be done 86 and moses brought aaron and his sons and washed them with water 87 and he put upon him the coat and girded him with the girdle and clothed him with the robe and put the ephod upon him and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod and bound it unto him therewith 88 and he put the breastplate upon him also he put in the breastplate the urim and the thummim 89 and he put the mitre upon his head also upon the mitre even upon his forefront did he put the golden plate the holy crown as the lord commanded moses 810 and moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein and sanctified them 811 and he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all his vessels both the laver and his foot to sanctify them 812 and he poured of the anointing oil upon aarons head and anointed him to sanctify him 813 and moses brought aarons sons and put coats upon them and girded them with girdles and put bonnets upon them as the lord commanded moses 814 and he brought the bullock for the sin offering and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering 815 and he slew it and moses took the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger and purified the altar and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar and sanctified it to make reconciliation upon it 816 and he took all the fat that was upon the inwards and the caul above the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and moses burned it upon the altar 817 but the bullock and his hide his flesh and his dung he burnt with fire without the camp as the lord commanded moses 818 and he brought the ram for the burnt offering and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram 819 and he killed it and moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about 820 and he cut the ram into pieces and moses burnt the head and the pieces and the fat 821 and he washed the inwards and the legs in water and moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar it was a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour and an offering made by fire unto the lord as the lord commanded moses 822 and he brought the other ram the ram of consecration and aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram 823 and he slew it and moses took of the blood of it and put it upon the tip of aarons right ear and upon the thumb of his

upon aaron and upon his garments and upon his sons and upon his sons garments with him and sanctified aaron and his garments and his sons and his sons garments with him 831 and moses said unto aaron and to his sons boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and there eat it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations as i commanded saying aaron and his sons shall eat it 832 and that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire 833 and ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation in seven days until the days of your consecration be at an end for seven days shall he consecrate you 834 as he hath done this day so the lord hath commanded to do to make an atonement for you 835 therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days and keep the charge of the lord that ye die not for so i am commanded 836 so aaron and his sons did all things which the lord commanded by the hand of moses 91 and it came to pass on the eighth day that moses called aaron and his sons and the elders of israel 92 and he said unto aaron take thee a young calf for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering without blemish and offer them before the lord 93 and unto the children of israel thou shalt speak saying take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb both of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering 94 also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice before the lord and a meat offering mingled with oil for to day the lord will appear unto you 95 and they brought that which moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation and all the congregation drew near and stood before the lord 96 and moses said this is the thing which the lord commanded that ye should do and the glory of the lord shall appear unto you 97 and moses said unto aaron go unto the altar and offer thy sin offering and thy burnt offering and make an atonement for thyself and for the people and offer the offering of the people and make an atonement for them as the lord commanded 98 aaron therefore went unto the altar and slew the calf of the sin offering which was for himself 99 and the sons of aaron brought the blood unto him and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar 910 but the fat and the kidneys and the caul above the liver of the sin offering he burnt upon the altar as the lord commanded moses 911 and the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp 912 and he slew the burnt offering and aarons sons presented unto him the blood which he sprinkled round about upon the altar 913 and they presented the burnt offering unto him with the pieces thereof and the head and he burnt them upon the altar 914 and he did wash the inwards and the legs and burnt them upon the burnt offering on the altar 915 and he brought the peoples offering and took the goat which was the sin offering for the people and slew it and offered it for sin as the first 916 and he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the manner 917 and he brought the meat offering and took an handful thereof and burnt it upon the altar beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning 918 he slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people and aarons sons presented unto him the blood which he sprinkled upon the altar round about 919 and the fat of the bullock and of the ram the rump and that which covereth the inwards and the kidneys and the caul above the liver 920 and they put the fat upon the breasts and he burnt the fat upon the altar 921 and the breasts and the right shoulder aaron waved for a wave offering before the lord as moses commanded 922 and aaron lifted up his hand toward the people and blessed them and came down from offering of the sin offering and the burnt offering and peace offerings 923 and moses and aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation and came out and blessed the people and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the people 924 and there came a fire out from before the lord and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat which when all the people saw they shouted and fell on their faces 101 and nadab and abihu the sons of aaron took either of them his censer and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered strange fire before the lord which he commanded them not 102 and there went out fire from the lord and devoured them and they died before the lord 103 then moses said unto aaron this is it that the lord spake saying i will be sanctified in them that come nigh me and before all the people i will be glorified and aaron held his peace 104 and moses called mishael and elzaphan the sons of uzziel the uncle of aaron and said unto them come near carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp 105 so they went near and carried them in their coats out of the camp as moses had said 106 and moses said unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his sons uncover not your heads neither rend your clothes lest ye die and lest wrath come upon all the people but let your brethren the whole house of israel bewail the burning which the lord hath kindled 107 and ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die for the anointing oil of the lord is upon you and they did according to the word of moses 108 and the lord spake unto aaron saying 109 do not drink wine nor strong drink thou nor thy sons with thee when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation lest ye die it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations 1010 and that ye may put difference between holy and unholy and between unclean and clean 1011 and that ye may teach the children of israel all the statutes which the lord hath spoken unto them by the hand of moses 1012 and moses spake unto aaron and unto eleazar and unto ithamar his sons that were left take the meat offering that remaineth of the offerings of the lord made by fire and eat it without leaven beside the altar for it is most holy 1013 and ye shall eat it in the holy place because it is thy due and thy sons due of the sacrifices of the lord made by fire for so i am commanded 1014 and the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place thou and thy sons and thy daughters with thee for they be thy due and thy sons due which are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of israel 1015 the heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat to wave it for a wave offering before the lord and it shall be thine and thy sons with thee by a statute for ever as the lord hath commanded 1016 and moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering and behold it was burnt and he was angry with eleazar and ithamar the sons of aaron which were left alive saying 1017 wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place seeing it is most holy and god hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation to make atonement for them before the lord 1018 behold the blood of it was not brought in within the holy place ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place as i commanded 1019 and aaron said unto moses behold this day have they offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the lord and such things have befallen me and if i had eaten the sin offering to day should it have been accepted in the sight of the lord 1020 and when moses heard that he was content 111 and the lord spake unto moses and to aaron saying unto them 112 speak unto the children of israel saying these are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth 113 whatsoever parteth the hoof and is clovenfooted and cheweth the cud among the beasts that shall ye eat 114 nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud or of them that divide the hoof as the camel because he cheweth the cud but divideth not the hoof he is unclean unto you 115 and the coney because he

between the unclean and the clean and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten 121 and the lord spake unto moses saying 122 speak unto the children of israel saying if a woman have conceived seed and born a man child then she shall be unclean seven days according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean 123 and in the eighth day the flesh

that sojourn among you that eateth any manner of blood i will even set my face against that soul that eateth blood and will cut him off from among his people 1711 for the life of the flesh is in the blood and i have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul 1712 therefore i said unto the children of israel no soul of you shall eat blood neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood 1713 and whatsoever man there be of the children of israel or of the strangers that sojourn among you which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten he shall even pour out the blood thereof and cover it with dust 1714 for it is the life of all flesh the blood of it is for the life thereof

you 1825 and the land is defiled therefore i do visit the iniquity thereof upon it and the land itself vomiteth out her inhabitants 1826 ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments and shall not commit any of these abominations neither any of your own nation nor any stranger that sojourneth among you 1827 for all these abominations have the men of the land done which were before you and the land is defiled 1828 that the land spue not you out also when ye defile it as it spued out the nations that were before you 1829 for whosoever shall commit any of these abominations even the souls

the altar because he hath a blemish that he profane not my sanctuaries for i the lord do sanctify them 2124 and moses told it unto aaron and to his sons and unto all the children of israel 221 and the lord spake unto moses saying 222 speak unto aaron and to his sons that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of israel and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow unto me i am the lord 223 say unto them whosoever he be of all your seed among your generations that goeth unto the holy things which the children of israel hallow unto the lord

the israelitish womans son blasphemed the name of the lord and cursed and they brought him unto moses and his mothers name was shelomith the daughter of dibri of the tribe of dan 2412 and they put him in ward that the mind of the lord might be shewed them 2413 and the lord spake unto moses saying 2414 bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head and let all the congregation stone him 2415 and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel saying whosoever curseth his god shall bear his sin 2416 and he that blasphemeth the name of the

spake to the children of israel that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp and stone him with stones and the children of israel did as the lord commanded moses 251 and the lord spake unto moses in mount sinai saying 252 speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land which i give you then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the lord 253 six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof 254 but in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land a sabbath for the lord thou shalt neither sow thy field nor prune thy vineyard 255 that which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed for it is a year of rest unto the land 256 and the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you for thee and for thy servant and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee 257 and for thy cattle and for the beast that are in thy land shall all the increase thereof be meat 258 and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years 259 then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land 2510 and ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubile unto you and ye shall return every man unto his possession and ye shall return every man unto his family 2511 a jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you ye shall not sow neither reap that which groweth of itself

return every man unto his possession 2514 and if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour or buyest ought of thy neighbours hand ye shall not oppress one another 2515 according to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt buy of thy neighbour and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee 2516 according to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it for according to the number of the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee 2517 ye shall not therefore oppress one another but thou shalt fear thy godfor i am the lord your god 2518 wherefore ye shall do my statutes and keep my judgments and do them and ye shall dwell in the land in safety 2519 and the land shall yield her fruit and ye shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety 2520 and if ye shall say what shall we eat the seventh year behold we shall not sow nor gather in our increase 2521 then i will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year and it shall bring forth fruit for three years 2522 and ye shall sow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit until the ninth year until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store 2523 the land shall not be sold for ever for the land is mine for ye are strangers and sojourners with me 2524 and in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land 2525 if thy brother be waxen poor and hath sold away some of his possession and if any of his kin come to redeem it then shall he redeem that which his brother sold 2526 and if the man have none to redeem it and himself be able to redeem it 2527 then let him count the years of the sale thereof and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it that he may return unto his possession 2528 but if he be not able to restore it to him then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubile and in the jubile it shall go out and he shall return unto his possession 2529 and if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold within a full year may he redeem it 2530 and if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations it shall not go out in the jubile 2531 but the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be redeemed and they shall go out in the jubile 2532 notwithstanding the cities of the levites and the houses of the cities of their possession may the levites redeem at any time 2533 and if a man purchase of the levites then the house that was sold and the city of his possession shall go out in the year of jubile for the houses of the cities of the levites are their possession among the children of israel 2534 but the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold for it is their perpetual possession 2535 and if thy brother be waxen poor and fallen in decay with thee then thou shalt relieve him yea though he be a stranger or a sojourner that he may live with thee 2536 take thou no usury of him or increase but fear thy god that thy brother may live with thee 2537 thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury nor lend him thy victuals for increase 2538 i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land of egypt to give you the land of canaan and to be your god 2539 and if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor and be sold unto thee thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant 2540 but as an hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile 2541 and then shall he depart from thee both he and his children with him and shall return unto his own family and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return 2542 for they are my servants which i brought forth out of the land of egypt they shall not be sold as bondmen 2543 thou shalt not rule over him with rigour but shalt fear thy god 2544 both thy bondmen and thy bondmaids which thou shalt have shall be of the heathen that are round about you of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids 2545 moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you of them shall ye buy and of their families that are with you which they begat in your land and they shall be your possession 2546 and ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you to inherit them for a possession they shall be your bondmen for ever but over your brethren the children of israel ye shall not rule one over another with rigour 2547 and if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner by thee or to the stock of the strangers family 2548 after that he is sold he may be redeemed again one of his brethren may redeem him 2549 either his uncle or his uncles son may redeem him or any that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him or if he be able he may redeem himself 2550 and he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him 2551 if there be yet many years behind according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for 2552 and if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile then he shall count with him and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption 2553 and as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him and the other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight 2554 and if he be not redeemed in these years then he shall go out in the year of jubile both he and his children with him 2555 for unto me the children of israel are servants they are my servants whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god 261 ye shall make you no idols nor graven image neither rear you up a standing image neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your land to bow down unto it for i am the lord your god 262 ye shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary i am the lord 263 if ye walk in my statutes and keep my commandments and do them 264 then i will give you rain in due season and the land shall yield her increase and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit 265 and your threshing shall reach unto the vintage and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time and ye shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land safely 266 and i will give peace in the land and ye shall lie down and none shall make you afraid and i will rid evil beasts out of the land neither shall the sword go through your land 267 and ye shall chase your enemies and they shall fall before you by the sword 268 and five of you shall chase an hundred and an hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword 269 for i will have respect unto you and make you fruitful and multiply you and establish my covenant with you 2610 and ye shall eat old store and bring forth the old because of the new 2611 and i set my tabernacle among you and my soul shall not abhor you 2612 and i will walk among you and will be your god and ye shall be my people 2613 i am the lord your god which brought you forth out of the land of egypt that ye should not be their bondmen and i have broken the bands of your yoke and made you go upright 2614 but if ye will not hearken unto me and will not do all these commandments 2615 and if ye shall despise my statutes or if your soul abhor my judgments so that ye will not do all my commandments but that ye break my covenant 2616 i also will do this unto you i will even appoint over you terror consumption and the burning ague that shall consume the eyes and cause sorrow of heart and ye shall sow your seed in vain for your enemies shall eat it 2617 and i will set my face against you and ye shall be slain before your enemies they that hate you shall reign over you and ye shall flee when none pursueth you 2618 and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me then i will punish you seven times more for your sins 2619 and i will break the pride of your power and i will make your heaven as iron and your earth as brass 2620 and your strength shall be spent in vain for your land shall not yield her increase neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits 2621 and if ye walk contrary unto me and will not hearken unto me i will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins 2622 i will also send wild beasts among you which shall rob you of your children and destroy your cattle and make you few in number and your high ways shall be desolate 2623 and if ye will not be reformed by me by these things but will walk contrary unto me 2624 then will i also walk contrary unto you and will punish you yet seven times for your sins 2625 and i will bring a sword upon you that shall avenge the quarrel of my covenant and when ye are gathered together within your cities i will send the pestilence among you and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy 2626 and when i have broken the staff of your bread ten women shall bake your bread in one oven and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight and ye shall eat and not be satisfied 2627 and if ye will not for all this hearken unto me but walk contrary unto me 2628 then i will walk contrary unto you also in fury and i even i will chastise you seven times for your sins 2629 and ye shall eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat 2630 and i will destroy your high places and cut down your images and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols and my soul shall abhor you 2631 and i will make your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation and i will not smell the savour of your sweet odours 2632 and i will bring the land into desolation and your enemies which dwell therein shall be astonished at it 2633 and i will scatter you among the heathen and will draw out a sword after you and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste 2634 then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths as long as it lieth desolate and ye be in your enemies land even then shall the land rest and enjoy her sabbaths 2635 as long as it lieth desolate it shall rest because it did not rest in your sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it 2636 and upon them that are left alive of you i will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them and they shall flee as fleeing from a sword and they shall fall when none pursueth 2637 and they shall fall one upon another as it were before a sword when none pursueth and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies 2638 and ye shall perish among the heathen and the land of your enemies shall eat you up 2639 and they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies lands and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them 2640 if they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers with their trespass which they trespassed against me and that also they have walked contrary unto me 2641 and that i also have walked contrary unto them and have brought them into the land of their enemies if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity 2642 then will i remember my covenant with jacob and also my covenant with isaac and also my covenant with abraham will i remember and i will remember the land 2643 the land also shall be left of them and shall enjoy her sabbaths while she lieth desolate without them and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity because even because they despised my judgments and because their soul abhorred my statutes 2644 and yet for all that when they be in the land of their enemies i will not cast them away neither will i abhor them to destroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them for i am the lord their god 2645 but i will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors whom i brought forth out of the land of egypt in the sight of the heathen that i might be their god i am the lord 2646 these are the statutes and judgments and laws which the lord made between him and the children of israel in mount sinai by the hand of moses 271 and the lord spake unto moses saying 272 speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when a man shall make a singular vow the persons shall be for the lord by thy estimation 273 and thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver after the shekel of the sanctuary 274 and if it be a female then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels 275 and if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels 276 and if it be from a month old even unto five years old then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver 277 and if it be from sixty years old and above if it be a male then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels and for the female ten shekels 278 but if he be poorer than thy estimation then he shall present himself before the priest and the priest shall value him according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him 279 and if it be a beast whereof men bring an offering unto the lord all that any man giveth of such unto the lord shall be holy 2710 he shall not alter it nor change it a good for a bad or a bad for a good and if he shall at all change beast for beast then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy 2711 and if it be any unclean beast of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the lord then he shall present the beast before the priest 2712 and the priest shall value it whether it be good or bad as thou valuest it who art the priest so shall it be 2713 but if he will at all redeem it then he shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation 2714 and when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the lord then the priest shall estimate it whether it be good or bad as the priest shall estimate it so shall it stand 2715 and if he that sanctified it will redeem his house then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it and it shall be his 2716 and if a man shall sanctify unto the lord some part of a field of his possession then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver 2717 if he sanctify his field from the year of jubile according to thy estimation it shall stand 2718 but if he sanctify his field after the jubile then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain even unto the year of the jubile and it shall be abated from thy estimation 2719 and if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it and it shall be assured to him 2720 and if he will not redeem the field or if he have sold the field to another man it shall not be redeemed any more 2721 but the field when it goeth out in the jubile shall be holy unto the lord as a field devoted the possession thereof shall be the priests 2722 and if a man sanctify unto the lord a field which he hath bought which is not of the fields of his possession 2723 then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation even unto the year of the jubile and he shall give thine estimation in that day as a holy thing unto the lord 2724 in the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong 2725 and all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary twenty gerahs shall be the shekel 2726 only the firstling of the beasts which should be the lords firstling no man shall sanctify it whether it be ox or sheep it is the lords 2727 and if it be of an unclean beast then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation and shall add a fifth part of it thereto or if it be not redeemed then it shall be sold according to thy estimation 2728 notwithstanding no devoted thing that a man shall devote unto the lord of all that he hath both of man and beast and of the field of his possession shall be sold or redeemed every devoted thing is most holy unto the lord 2729 none devoted which shall be devoted of men shall be redeemed but shall surely be put to death 2730 and all the tithe of the land whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree is the lords it is holy unto the lord 2731 and if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof 2732 and concerning the tithe of the herd or of the flock even of whatsoever passeth under the rod the tenth shall be holy unto the lord 2733 he shall not search whether it be good or bad neither shall he change it and if he change it at all then both it and the change thereof shall be holy it shall not be redeemed 2734 these are the commandments which the lord commanded moses

unto it the fifth part thereof and give it unto him against whom he hath trespassed 58 but if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto let the trespass be recompensed unto the lord even to the priest beside the ram of the atonement whereby an atonement shall be made for him 59 and every offering of all the holy things of the children of israel which they bring unto the priest shall be his 510 and every mans hallowed things shall be his whatsoever any man giveth the priest it shall be his 511 and the lord spake unto moses saying 512 speak unto the children of israel and say unto them if any mans wife go aside and commit a trespass against him 513 and a man lie with her carnally and it be hid from the eyes of her husband and be kept close and she be defiled and there be no witness against her neither she be taken with the manner 514 and the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be defiled or if the spirit of jealousy come upon him and he be jealous of his wife and she be not defiled 515 then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest and he shall bring her offering for her the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal he shall pour no oil upon it nor put frankincense thereon for it is an offering of jealousy an offering of memorial bringing iniquity to remembrance 516 and the priest shall bring her near and set her before the lord 517 and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take and put it into the water 518 and the priest shall set the woman before the lord and uncover the womans head and put the offering of memorial in her hands which is the jealousy offering and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse 519 and the priest shall charge her by an oath and say unto the woman if no man have lain with thee and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse 520 but if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband and if thou be defiled and some man have lain with thee beside thine husband 521 then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing and the priest shall say unto the woman the lord make thee a curse and an oath among thy people when the lord doth make thy thigh to rot and thy belly to swell 522 and this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels to make thy belly to swell and thy thigh to rot and the woman shall say amen amen 523 and the priest shall write these curses in a book and he shall blot them out with the bitter water 524 and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter 525 then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the womans hand and shall wave the offering before the lord and offer it upon the altar 526 and the priest shall take an handful of the offering even the memorial thereof and burn it upon the altar and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water 527 and when he hath made her to drink the water then it shall come to pass that if she be defiled and have done trespass against her husband that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her and become bitter and her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot and the woman shall be a curse among her people 528 and if the woman be not defiled but be clean then she shall be free and shall conceive seed 529 this is the law of jealousies when a wife goeth aside to another instead of her husband and is defiled 530 or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him and he be jealous over his wife and shall set the woman before the lord and the priest shall execute upon her all this law 531 then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity and this woman shall bear her iniquity 61 and the lord spake unto moses saying 62 speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a nazarite to separate themselves unto the lord 63 he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist grapes or dried 64 all the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made of the vine tree from the kernels even to the husk 65 all the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head until the days be fulfilled in the which he separateth himself unto the lord he shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow 66 all the days that he separateth himself unto the lord he shall come at no dead body 67 he shall not make himself unclean for his father or for his mother for his brother or for his sister when they die because the consecration of his god is upon his head 68 all the days of his separation he is holy unto the lord 69 and if any man die very suddenly by him and he hath defiled the head of his consecration then he shall shave his head in the day of his cleansing on the seventh day shall he shave it 610 and on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles or two young pigeons to the priest to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation 611 and the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering and make an atonement for him for that he sinned by the dead and shall hallow his head that same day 612 and he shall consecrate unto the lord the days of his separation and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass offering but the days that were before shall be lost because his separation was defiled 613 and this is the law of the nazarite when the days of his separation are fulfilled he shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation 614 and he shall offer his offering unto the lord one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering and one ram without blemish for peace offerings 615 and a basket of unleavened bread cakes of fine flour mingled with oil and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil and their meat offering and their drink offerings 616 and the priest shall bring them before the lord and shall offer his sin offering and his burnt offering 617 and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the lord with the basket of unleavened bread the priest shall offer also his meat offering and his drink offering 618 and the nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and shall take the hair of the head of his separation and put it in the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings 619 and the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer and shall put them upon the hands of the nazarite after the hair of his separation is shaven 620 and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the lord this is holy for the priest with the wave breast and heave shoulder and after that the nazarite may drink wine 621 this is the law of the nazarite who hath vowed and of his offering unto the lord for his separation beside that that his hand shall get according to the vow which he vowed so he must do after the law of his separation 622 and the lord spake unto moses saying 623 speak unto aaron and unto his sons saying on this wise ye shall bless the children of israel saying unto them 624 the lord bless thee and keep thee 625 the lord make his face shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee 626 the lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace 627 and they shall put my name upon the children of israel and i will bless them 71 and it came to pass on the day that moses had fully set up the tabernacle and had anointed it

sons of gershon according to their service 78 and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of merari according unto their service under the hand of ithamar the son of aaron the priest 79 but

that was upon the ark of testimony from between the two cherubims and he spake unto him 81 and the lord spake unto moses saying 82 speak unto aaron and say unto him when thou lightest the lamps the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick 83 and aaron did so he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick as the lord commanded moses 84 and this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold unto the shaft thereof unto the flowers thereof was beaten work according unto the pattern which the lord had shewed moses so he made the candlestick 85 and the lord spake unto moses saying 86 take the levites from among the children of israel and cleanse them 87 and thus shalt thou do unto them to cleanse them sprinkle water of purifying upon them and let them shave all their flesh and let them wash their clothes and so make themselves clean 88 then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering even fine flour mingled with oil and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering 89 and thou shalt bring the levites before the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of israel together 810 and thou shalt bring the levites before the lord and the children of israel shall put their hands upon the levites 811 and aaron shall offer the levites before the lord for an offering of the children of israel that they may execute the service of the lord 812 and the levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering unto the lord to make an atonement for the levites 813 and thou shalt set the levites before aaron and before his sons and offer them for an offering unto the lord 814 thus shalt thou separate the levites from among the children of israel and the levites shall be mine 815 and after that shall the levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and thou shalt cleanse them and offer them for an offering 816 for they are wholly given unto me from among the children of israel instead of such as open every womb even instead of the firstborn of all the children of israel have i taken them unto me 817 for all the firstborn of the children of israel are mine both man and beast on the day that i smote every firstborn in the land of egypt i sanctified them for myself 818 and i have taken the levites for all the firstborn of the children of israel 819 and i have given the levites as a gift to aaron and to his sons from among the children of israel to do the service of the children of israel in the tabernacle of the congregation and to make an atonement for the children of israel that there be no plague among the children of israel when the children of israel come nigh unto the sanctuary 820 and moses and aaron and all the congregation of the children of israel did to the levites according unto all that the lord commanded moses concerning the levites so did the children of israel unto them 821 and the levites were purified and they washed their clothes and aaron offered them as an offering before the lord and aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them 822 and after that went the levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before aaron and before his sons as the lord had commanded moses concerning the levites so did they unto them 823 and the lord spake unto moses saying 824 this is it that belongeth unto the levites from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation 825 and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof and shall serve no more 826 but shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation to keep the charge and shall do no service thus shalt thou do unto the levites touching their charge 91 and the lord spake unto moses in the wilderness of sinai in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of egypt saying 92 let the children of israel also keep the passover at his appointed season 93 in the fourteenth day of this month at even ye shall keep it in his appointed season according to all the rites of it and according to all the ceremonies thereof shall ye keep it 94 and moses spake unto the children of israel that they should keep the passover 95 and they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at even in the wilderness of sinai according to all that the lord commanded moses so did the children of israel 96 and there were certain men who were defiled by the dead body of a man that they could not keep the passover on that day and they came before moses and before aaron on that day 97 and those men said unto him we are defiled by the dead body of a man wherefore are we kept back that we may not offer an offering of the lord in his appointed season among the children of israel 98 and moses said unto them stand still and i will hear what the lord will command concerning you 99 and the lord spake unto moses saying 910 speak unto the children of israel saying if any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body or be in a journey afar off yet he shall keep the passover unto the lord 911 the fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs 912 they shall leave none of it unto the morning nor break any bone of it according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it 913 but the man that is clean and is not in a journey and forbeareth to keep the passover even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people because he brought not the offering of the lord in his appointed season that man shall bear his sin 914 and if a stranger shall sojourn among you and will keep the passover unto the lord according to the ordinance of the passover and according to the manner thereof so shall he do ye shall have one ordinance both for the stranger and for him that was born in the land 915 and on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle namely the tent of the testimony and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire until the morning 916 so it was alway the cloud covered it by day and the appearance of fire by night 917 and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle then after that the children of israel journeyed and in the place where the cloud abode there the children of israel pitched their tents 918 at the commandment of the lord the children of israel journeyed and at the commandment of the lord they pitched as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents 919 and when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days then the children of israel kept the charge of the lord and journeyed not 920 and so it was when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle according to the commandment of the lord they abode in their tents and according to the commandment of the lord they journeyed 921 and so it was when the cloud abode from even unto the morning and that the cloud was taken up in the morning then they journeyed whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up they journeyed 922 or whether it were two days or a month or a year that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle remaining thereon the children of israel abode in their tents and journeyed not but when it was taken up they journeyed 923 at the commandment of the lord they rested in the tents and at the commandment of the lord they journeyed they kept the charge of the lord at the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses 101 and the lord spake unto moses saying 102 make thee two trumpets of silver of a whole piece shalt thou make them that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly and for the journeying of the camps 103 and when they shall blow with them all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation 104 and if they blow but with one trumpet then the princes which are heads of the thousands of israel shall gather themselves unto thee 105 when ye blow an alarm then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward 106 when ye blow an alarm the second time then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey they shall blow an alarm for their journeys 107 but when the congregation is to be gathered together ye shall blow but ye shall not sound an alarm 108 and the sons of aaron the priests shall blow with the trumpets and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations 109 and if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets and ye shall be remembered before the lord your god and ye shall be saved from your enemies 1010 also in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days and in the beginnings of your months ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings that they may be to you for a memorial before your god i am the lord your god 1011 and it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month in the second year that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony 1012 and the children of israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of sinai and the cloud rested in the wilderness of paran 1013 and they first took their journey according to the commandment of the lord by the hand of moses 1014 in the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of judah according to their armies and over his host was nahshon the son of amminadab 1015 and over the host of the tribe of the children of issachar was nethaneel the son of zuar 1016 and over the host of the tribe of the children of zebulun was eliab the son of helon 1017 and the tabernacle was taken down and the sons of gershon and the sons of merari set forward bearing the tabernacle 1018 and the standard of the camp of reuben set forward according to their armies and over his host was elizur the son of shedeur 1019 and over the host of the tribe of the children of simeon was shelumiel the son of zurishaddai 1020 and over the host of the tribe of the children of gad was eliasaph the son of deuel 1021 and the kohathites set forward bearing the sanctuary and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came 1022 and the standard of the camp of the children of ephraim set forward according to their armies and over his host was elishama the son of ammihud 1023 and over the host of the tribe of the children of manasseh was gamaliel the son of pedahzur 1024 and over the host of the tribe of the children of benjamin was abidan the son of gideoni 1025 and the standard of the camp of the children of dan set forward which was the rereward of all the camps throughout their hosts and over his host was ahiezer the son of ammishaddai 1026 and over the host of the tribe of the children of asher was pagiel the son of ocran 1027 and over the host of the tribe of the children of naphtali was ahira the son of enan 1028 thus were the journeyings of the children of israel according to their armies when they set forward 1029 and moses said unto hobab the son of raguel the midianite moses father in law we are journeying unto the place of which the lord said i will give it you come thou with us and we will do thee good for the lord hath spoken good concerning israel 1030 and he said unto him i will not go but i will depart to mine own land and to my kindred 1031 and he said leave us not i pray thee forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes 1032 and it shall be if thou go with us yea it shall be that what goodness the lord shall do unto us the same will we do unto thee 1033 and they departed from the mount of the lord three days journey and the ark of the covenant of the lord went before them in the three days journey to search out a resting place for them 1034 and the cloud of the lord was upon them by day when they went out of the camp 1035 and it came to pass when the ark set forward that moses said rise up lord and let thine enemies be scattered and let them that hate thee flee before thee 1036 and when it rested he said return o lord unto the many thousands of israel 111 and when the people complained it displeased the lord and the lord heard it and his anger was kindled and the fire of the lord burnt among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp 112 and the people cried unto moses and when moses prayed unto the lord the fire was quenched 113 and he called the name of the place taberah because the fire of the lord burnt among them 114 and the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting and the children of israel also wept again and said who shall give us flesh to eat 115 we remember the fish which we did eat in egypt freely the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlick 116 but now our soul is dried away there is nothing at all beside this manna before our eyes 117 and the manna was as coriander seed and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium 118 and the people went about and gathered it and ground it in mills or beat it in a mortar and baked it in pans and made cakes of it and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil 119 and when the dew fell upon the camp in the night the manna fell upon it 1110 then moses heard the people weep throughout their families every man in the door of his tent and the anger of the lord was kindled greatly moses also was displeased 1111 and moses said unto the lord wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant and wherefore have i not found favour in thy sight that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me 1112 have i conceived all this people have i begotten them that thou shouldest say unto me carry them in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth the sucking child unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers 1113 whence should i have flesh to give unto all this people for they weep unto me saying give us flesh that we may eat 1114 i am not able to bear all this people alone because it is too heavy for me 1115 and if thou deal thus with me kill me i pray thee out of hand if i have found favour in thy sight and let me not see my wretchedness 1116 and the lord said unto moses gather unto me seventy men of the elders of israel whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people and officers over them and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation that they may stand there with thee 1117 and i will come down and talk with thee there and i will take of the spirit which is upon thee and will put it upon them and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee that thou bear it not thyself alone 1118 and say thou unto the people sanctify yourselves against to morrow and ye shall eat flesh for ye have wept in the ears of the lord saying who shall give us flesh to eat for it was well with us in egypt therefore the lord will give you flesh and ye shall eat 1119 ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither ten days nor twenty days 1120 but even a whole month until it come out at your nostrils and it be loathsome unto you because that ye have despised the lord which is among you and have wept before him saying why came we forth out of egypt 1121 and moses said the people among whom i am are six hundred thousand footmen and thou hast said i will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month 1122 shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them to suffice them or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them to suffice them 1123 and the lord said unto moses is the lords hand waxed short thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not 1124 and moses went out and told the people the words of the lord and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people and set them round about the tabernacle 1125 and the lord came down in a cloud and spake unto him and took of the spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the seventy elders and it came to pass that when the spirit rested upon them they prophesied and did not cease 1126 but there remained two of the men in the camp the name of the one was eldad and the name of the other medad and the spirit rested upon them and they were of them that were written but went not out unto the tabernacle and they prophesied in the camp 1127 and there ran a young man and told moses and said eldad and medad do prophesy in the camp 1128 and joshua the son of nun the servant of moses one of his young men answered and said my lord moses forbid them 1129 and moses said unto him enviest thou for my sake would god that all the lords people were prophets and that the lord would put his spirit upon them 1130 and moses gat him into the camp he and the elders of israel 1131 and there went forth a wind from the lord and brought quails from the sea and let them fall by the camp as it were a days journey on this side and as it were a days journey on the other side round about the camp and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth 1132 and the people stood up all that day and all that night and all the next day and they gathered the quails he that gathered least gathered ten homers and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp 1133 and while the flesh was yet between their teeth ere it was chewed the wrath of the lord was kindled against the people and the lord smote the people with a very great plague 1134 and he called the name of that place kibrothhattaavah because there they buried the people that lusted 1135 and the people journeyed from kibrothhattaavah unto hazeroth and abode at hazeroth 121 and miriam and aaron spake against moses because of the ethiopian woman whom he had married for he had married an ethiopian woman 122 and they said hath the lord indeed spoken only by moses hath he not spoken also by us and the lord heard it 123 now the man moses was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth 124 and the lord spake suddenly unto moses and unto aaron and unto miriam come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out 125 and the lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle and called aaron and miriam and they both came forth 126 and he said hear now my words if there be a prophet among you i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream 127 my servant moses is not so who is faithful in all mine house 128 with him will i speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the lord shall he behold wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant moses 129 and the anger of the lord was kindled against them and he departed 1210 and the cloud departed from off the tabernacle and behold miriam became leprous white as snow and aaron looked upon miriam and behold she was leprous 1211 and aaron said unto moses alas my lord i beseech thee lay not the sin upon us wherein we have done foolishly and wherein we have sinned 1212 let her not be as one dead of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mothers womb 1213 and moses cried unto the lord saying heal her now o god i beseech thee 1214 and the lord said unto moses if her father had but spit in her face should she not be ashamed seven days let her be shut out from the camp seven days and after that let her be received in again 1215 and miriam was shut out from the camp seven days and the people journeyed not till miriam was brought in again 1216 and afterward the people removed from hazeroth and pitched in the wilderness of paran 131 and the lord spake unto moses saying 132 send thou men that they may search the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man every one a ruler among them 133 and moses by the commandment of the lord sent them from the wilderness of paran all those men were heads of the children of israel 134 and these were their names of the tribe of reuben shammua the son of zaccur 135 of the tribe of simeon shaphat the son of hori 136 of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh 137 of the tribe of issachar igal the son of joseph 138 of the tribe of ephraim oshea the son of nun 139 of the tribe of benjamin palti the son of raphu 1310 of the tribe of zebulun gaddiel the son of sodi 1311 of the tribe of joseph namely of the tribe of manasseh gaddi the son of susi 1312 of the tribe of dan ammiel the son of gemalli 1313 of the tribe of asher sethur the son of michael 1314 of the tribe of naphtali nahbi the son of vophsi 1315 of the tribe of gad geuel the son of machi 1316 these are the names of the men which moses sent to spy out the land and moses called oshea the son of nun jehoshua 1317 and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said unto them get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain 1318 and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein whether they be strong or weak few or many 1319 and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what cities they be that they dwell in whether in tents or in strong holds 1320 and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether there be wood therein or not and be ye of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes 1321 so they went up and searched the land from the wilderness of zin unto rehob as men come to hamath 1322 and they ascended by the south and came unto hebron where ahiman sheshai and talmai the children of anak were now hebron was built seven years before zoan in egypt 1323 and they came unto the brook of eshcol and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bare it between two upon a staff and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs 1324 the place was called the brook eshcol because of the cluster of grapes which the children of israel cut down from thence 1325 and they returned from searching of the land after forty days 1326 and they went and came to moses and to aaron and to all the congregation of the children of israel unto the wilderness of paran to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and shewed them the fruit of the land 1327 and they told him and said we came unto the land whither thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it 1328 nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there 1329 the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan 1330 and caleb stilled the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it 1331 but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we 1332 and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature 1333 and there we saw the giants the sons of anak which come of the giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight 141 and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night 142 and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would god that we had died in the land of egypt or would god we had died in this wilderness 143 and wherefore hath the lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey were it not better for us to return into egypt 144 and they said one to another let us make a captain and let us return into egypt 145 then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of israel 146 and joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes 147 and they spake unto all the company of the children of israel saying the land which we passed through to search it is an exceeding good land 148 if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us a land which floweth with milk and honey 149 only rebel not ye against the lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bread for us their defence is departed from them and the lord is with us fear them not 1410 but all the congregation bade stone them with stones and the glory of the lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of israel 1411 and the lord said unto moses how long will this people provoke me and how long will it be ere they believe me for all the signs which i have shewed among them 1412 i will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they 1413 and moses said unto the lord then the egyptians shall hear it for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them 1414 and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land for they have heard that thou lord art among this people that thou lord art seen face to face and that thy cloud standeth over them and that thou goest before them by day time in a pillar of a cloud and in a pillar of fire by night 1415 now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak saying 1416 because the lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness 1417 and now i beseech thee let the power of my lord be great according as thou hast spoken saying 1418 the lord is longsuffering and of great mercy forgiving iniquity and transgression and by no means clearing the guilty visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation 1419 pardon i beseech thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven this people from egypt even until now 1420 and the lord said i have pardoned according to thy word 1421 but as truly as i live all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the lord 1422 because all those men which have seen my glory and my miracles which i did in egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice 1423 surely they shall not see the land which i sware unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see it 1424 but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully him will i bring into the land whereinto he went and his seed shall possess it 1425 now the amalekites and the canaanites dwelt in the valley tomorrow turn you and get you into the wilderness by the way of the red sea 1426 and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying 1427 how long shall i bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel which they murmur against me 1428 say unto them as truly as i live saith the lord as ye have spoken in mine ears so will i do to you 1429 your carcases shall fall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from twenty years old and upward which have murmured against me 1430 doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which i sware to make you dwell therein save caleb the son of jephunneh and joshua the son of nun 1431 but your little ones which ye said should be a prey them will i bring in and they shall know the land which ye have despised 1432 but as for you your carcases they shall fall in this wilderness 1433 and your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years and bear your whoredoms until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness 1434 after the number of the days in which ye searched the land even forty days each day for a year shall ye bear your iniquities even forty years and ye shall know my breach of promise 1435 i the lord have said i will surely do it unto all this evil congregation that are gathered together against me in this wilderness they shall be consumed and there they shall die 1436 and the men which moses sent to search the land who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander upon the land 1437 even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land died by the plague before the lord 1438 but joshua the son of nun and caleb the son of jephunneh which were of the men that went to search the land lived still 1439 and moses told these sayings unto all the children of israel and the people mourned greatly 1440 and they rose up early in the morning and gat them up into the top of the mountain saying lo we be here and will go up unto the place which the lord hath promised for we have sinned 1441 and moses said wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the lord but it shall not prosper 1442 go not up for the lord is not among you that ye be not smitten before your enemies 1443 for the amalekites and the canaanites are there before you and ye shall fall by the sword because ye are turned away from the lord therefore the lord will not be with you 1444 but they presumed to go up unto the hill top nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the lord and moses departed not out of the camp 1445 then the amalekites came down and the canaanites which dwelt in that hill and smote them and discomfited them even unto hormah 151 and the lord spake unto moses saying 152 speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye be come into the land of your habitations which i give unto you 153 and will make an offering by fire unto the lord a burnt offering or a sacrifice in performing a vow or in a freewill offering or in your solemn feasts to make a sweet savour unto the lord of the herd or of the flock 154 then shall he that offereth his offering unto the lord bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil 155 and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice for one lamb 156 or for a ram thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil 157 and for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an hin of wine for a sweet savour unto the lord 158 and when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice in performing a vow or peace offerings unto the lord 159 then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil 1510 and thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine for an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord 1511 thus shall it be done for one bullock or for one ram or for a lamb or a kid 1512 according to the number that ye shall prepare so shall ye do to every one according to their number 1513 all that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner in offering an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord 1514 and if a stranger sojourn with you or whosoever be among you in your generations and will offer an offering made by fire of a sweet savour unto the lord as ye do so he shall do 1515 one ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation and also for the stranger that sojourneth with you an ordinance for ever in your generations as ye are so shall the stranger be before the lord 1516 one law and one manner shall be for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with you 1517 and the lord spake unto moses saying 1518 speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land whither i bring you 1519 then it shall be that when ye eat of the bread of the land ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the lord 1520 ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering as ye do the heave offering of the threshingfloor so shall ye heave it 1521 of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the lord an heave offering in your generations 1522 and if ye have erred and not observed all these commandments which the lord hath spoken unto moses 1523 even all that the lord hath commanded you by the hand of moses from the day that the lord commanded moses and henceforward among your generations 1524 then it shall be if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the lord with his meat offering and his drink offering according to the manner and one kid of the goats for a sin offering 1525 and the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of israel and it shall be forgiven them for it is ignorance and they shall bring their offering a sacrifice made by fire unto the lord and their sin offering before the lord for their ignorance 1526 and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of israel and the stranger that sojourneth among them seeing all the people were in ignorance 1527 and if any soul sin through ignorance then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering 1528 and the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sinneth ignorantly when he sinneth by ignorance before the lord to make an atonement for him and it shall be forgiven him 1529 ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance both for him that is born among the children of israel and for the stranger that sojourneth among them 1530 but the soul that doeth ought presumptuously whether he be born in the land or a stranger the same reproacheth the lord and that soul shall be cut off from among his people 1531 because he hath despised the word of the lord and hath broken his commandment that soul shall utterly be cut off his iniquity shall be upon him 1532 and while the children of israel were in the wilderness they found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day 1533 and they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto moses and aaron and unto all the congregation 1534 and they put him in ward because it was not declared what should be done to him 1535 and the lord said unto moses the man shall be surely put to death all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp 1536 and all the congregation brought him without the camp and stoned him with stones and he died as the lord commanded moses 1537 and the lord spake unto moses saying 1538 speak unto the children of israel and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue 1539 and it shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the lord and do them and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes after which ye use to go a whoring 1540 that ye may remember and do all my commandments and be holy unto your god 1541 i am the lord your god which brought you out of the land of egypt to be your god i am the lord your god 161 now korah the son of izhar the son of kohath the son of levi and dathan and abiram the sons of eliab and on the son of peleth sons of reuben took men 162 and they rose up before moses with certain of the children of israel two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly famous in the congregation men of renown 163 and they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron and said unto them ye take too much upon you seeing all the congregation are holy every one of them and the lord is among them wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the lord 164 and when moses heard it he fell upon his face 165 and he spake unto korah and unto all his company saying even to morrow the lord will shew who are his and who is holy and will cause him to come near unto him even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him 166 this do take you censers korah and all his company 167 and put fire therein and put incense in them before the lord to morrow and it shall be that the man whom the lord doth choose he shall be holy ye take too much upon you ye sons of levi 168 and moses said unto korah hear i pray you ye sons of levi 169 seemeth it but a small thing unto you that the god of israel hath separated you from the congregation of israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them 1610 and he hath brought thee near to him and all thy brethren the sons of levi with thee and seek ye the priesthood also 1611 for which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the lord and what is aaron that ye murmur against him 1612 and moses sent to call dathan and abiram the sons of eliab which said we will not come up 1613 is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us 1614 moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards wilt thou put out the eyes of these men we will not come up 1615 and moses was very wroth and said unto the lord respect not thou their offering i have not taken one ass from them neither have i hurt one of them 1616 and moses said unto korah be thou and all thy company before the lord thou and they and aaron to morrow 1617 and take every man his censer and put incense in them and bring ye before the lord every man his censer two hundred and fifty censers thou also and aaron each of you his censer 1618 and they took every man his censer and put fire in them and laid incense thereon and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with moses and aaron 1619 and korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the glory of the lord appeared unto all the congregation 1620 and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying 1621 separate yourselves from among this congregation that i may consume them in a moment 1622 and they fell upon their faces and said o god the god of the spirits of all flesh shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation 1623 and the lord spake unto moses saying 1624 speak unto the congregation saying get you up from about the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram 1625 and moses rose up and went unto dathan and abiram and the elders of israel followed him 1626 and he spake unto the congregation saying depart i pray you from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest ye be consumed in all their sins 1627 so they gat up from the tabernacle of korah dathan and abiram on every side and dathan and abiram came out and stood in the door of their tents and their wives and their sons and their little children 1628 and moses said hereby ye shall know that the lord hath sent me to do all these works for i have not done them of mine own mind 1629 if these men die the common death of all men or if they be visited after the visitation of all men then the lord hath not sent me 1630 but if the lord make a new thing and the earth open her mouth and swallow them up with all that appertain unto them and they go down quick into the pit then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the lord 1631 and it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking all these words that the ground clave asunder that was under them 1632 and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their houses and all the men that appertained unto korah and all their goods 1633 they and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit and the earth closed upon them and they perished from among the congregation 1634 and all israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them for they said lest the earth swallow us up also 1635 and there came out a fire from the lord and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense 1636 and the lord spake unto moses saying 1637 speak unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest that he take up the censers out of the burning and scatter thou the fire yonder for they are hallowed 1638 the censers of these sinners against their own souls let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar for they offered them before the lord therefore they are hallowed and they shall be a sign unto the children of israel 1639 and eleazar the priest took the brasen censers wherewith they that were burnt had offered and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar 1640 to be a memorial unto the children of israel that no stranger which is not of the seed of aaron come near to offer incense before the lord that he be not as korah and as his company as the lord said to him by the hand of moses 1641 but on the morrow all the congregation of the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron saying ye have killed the people of the lord 1642 and it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against moses and against aaron that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation and behold the cloud covered it and the glory of the lord appeared 1643 and moses and aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation 1644 and the lord spake unto moses saying 1645 get you up from among this congregation that i may consume them as in a moment and they fell upon their faces 1646 and moses said unto aaron take a censer and put fire therein from off the altar and put on incense and go quickly unto the congregation and make an atonement for them for there is wrath gone out from the lord the plague is begun 1647 and aaron took as moses commanded and ran into the midst of the congregation and behold the plague was begun among the people and he put on incense and made an atonement for the people 1648 and he stood between the dead and the living and the plague was stayed 1649 now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred beside them that died about the matter of korah 1650 and aaron returned unto moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and the plague was stayed 171 and the lord spake unto moses saying 172 speak unto the children of israel and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods write thou every mans name upon his rod 173 and thou shalt write aarons name upon the rod of levi for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers 174 and thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony where i will meet with you 175 and it shall come to pass that the mans rod whom i shall choose shall blossom and i will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of israel whereby they murmur against you 176 and moses spake unto the children of israel and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece for each prince one according to their fathers houses even twelve rods and the rod of aaron was among their rods 177 and moses laid up the rods before the lord in the tabernacle of witness 178 and it came to pass that on the morrow moses went into the tabernacle of witness and behold the rod of aaron for the house of levi was budded and brought forth buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds 179 and moses brought out all the rods from before the lord unto all the children of israel and they looked and took every man his rod 1710 and the lord said unto moses bring aarons rod again before the testimony to be kept for a token against the rebels and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me that they die not 1711 and moses did so as the lord commanded him so did he 1712 and the children of israel spake unto moses saying behold we die we perish we all perish 1713 whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the lord shall die shall we be consumed with dying 181 and the lord said unto aaron thou and thy sons and thy fathers house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood 182 and thy brethren also of the tribe of levi the tribe of thy father bring thou with thee that they may be joined unto thee and minister unto thee but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness 183 and they shall keep thy charge and the charge of all the tabernacle only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar that neither they nor ye also die 184 and they shall be joined unto thee and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation for all the service of the tabernacle and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you 185 and ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar that there be no wrath any more upon the children of israel 186 and i behold i have taken your brethren the levites from among the children of israel to you they are given as a gift for the lord to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation 187 therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priests office for everything of the altar and within the vail and ye shall serve i have given your priests office unto you as a service of gift and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death 188 and the lord spake unto aaron behold i also have given thee the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of israel unto thee have i given them by reason of the anointing and to thy sons by an ordinance for ever 189 this shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire every oblation of theirs every meat offering of theirs and every sin offering of theirs and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render unto me shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons 1810 in the most holy place shalt thou eat it every male shall eat it it shall be holy unto thee 1811 and this is thine the heave offering of their gift with all the wave offerings of the children of israel i have given them unto thee and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee by a statute for ever every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it 1812 all the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of the wheat the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the lord them have i given thee 1813 and whatsoever is first ripe in the land which they shall bring unto the lord shall be thine every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it 1814 every thing devoted in israel shall be thine 1815 every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh which they bring unto the lord whether it be of men or beasts shall be thine nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem 1816 and those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem according to thine estimation for the money of five shekels after the shekel of the sanctuary which is twenty gerahs 1817 but the firstling of a cow or the firstling of a sheep or the firstling of a goat thou shalt not redeem they are holy thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire for a sweet savour unto the lord 1818 and the flesh of them shall be thine as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are thine 1819 all the heave offerings of the holy things which the children of israel offer unto the lord have i given thee and thy sons and thy daughters with thee by a statute for ever it is a covenant of salt for ever before the lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee 1820 and the lord spake unto aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in their land neither shalt thou have any part among them i am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of israel 1821 and behold i have given the children of levi all the tenth in israel for an inheritance for their service which they serve even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation 1822 neither must the children of israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation lest they bear sin and die 1823 but the levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation and they shall bear their iniquity it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations that among the children of israel they have no inheritance 1824 but the tithes of the children of israel which they offer as an heave offering unto the lord i have given to the levites to inherit therefore i have said unto them among the children of israel they shall have no inheritance 1825 and the lord spake unto moses saying 1826 thus speak unto the levites and say unto them when ye take of the children of israel the tithes which i have given you from them for your inheritance then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the lord even a tenth part of the tithe 1827 and this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the corn of the threshingfloor and as the fulness of the winepress 1828 thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the lord of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of israel and ye shall give thereof the lords heave offering to aaron the priest 1829 out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the lord of all the best thereof even the hallowed part thereof out of it 1830 therefore thou shalt say unto them when ye have heaved the best thereof from it then it shall be counted unto the levites as the increase of the threshingfloor and as the increase of the winepress 1831 and ye shall eat it in every place ye and your households for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation 1832 and ye shall bear no sin by reason of it when ye have heaved from it the best of it neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of israel lest ye die 191 and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying 192 this is the ordinance of the law which the lord hath commanded saying speak unto the children of israel that they bring thee a red heifer without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke 193 and ye shall give her unto eleazar the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face 194 and eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times 195 and one shall burn the heifer in his sight her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he burn 196 and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer 197 then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until the even 198 and he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water and shall be unclean until the even 199 and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of separation it is a purification for sin 1910 and he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the children of israel and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them for a statute for ever 1911 he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days 1912 he shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day he shall be clean but if he purify not himself the third day then the seventh day he shall not be clean 1913 whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead and purifieth not himself defileth the tabernacle of the lord and that soul shall be cut off from israel because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him 1914 this is the law when a man dieth in a tent all that come into the tent and all that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days 1915 and every open vessel which hath no covering bound upon it is unclean 1916 and whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields or a dead body or a bone of a man or a grave shall be unclean seven days 1917 and for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel 1918 and a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the vessels and upon the persons that were there and upon him that touched a bone or one slain or one dead or a grave 1919 and the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day and on the seventh day he shall purify himself and wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean at even 1920 but the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the lord the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him he is unclean 1921 and it shall be a perpetual statute unto them that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even 1922 and whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even 201 then came the children of israel even the whole congregation into the desert of zin in the first month and the people abode in kadesh and miriam died there and was buried there 202 and there was no water for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against moses and against aaron 203 and the people chode with moses and spake saying would god that we had died when our brethren died before the lord 204 and why have ye brought up the congregation of the lord into this wilderness that we and our cattle should die there 205 and wherefore have ye made us to come up out of egypt to bring us in unto this evil place it is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates neither is there any water to drink 206 and moses and aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon their faces and the glory of the lord appeared unto them 207 and the lord spake unto moses saying 208 take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink 209 and moses took the rod from before the lord as he commanded him 2010 and moses and aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock and he said unto them hear now ye rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock 2011 and moses lifted up his hand and with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their beasts also 2012 and the lord spake unto moses and aaron because ye believed me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which i have given them 2013 this is the water of meribah because the children of israel strove with the lord and he was sanctified in them 2014 and moses sent messengers from kadesh unto the king of edom thus saith thy brother israel thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us 2015 how our fathers went down into egypt and we have dwelt in egypt a long time and the egyptians vexed us and our fathers 2016 and when we cried unto the lord he heard our voice and sent an angel and hath brought us forth out of egypt and behold we are in kadesh a city in the uttermost of thy border 2017 let us pass i pray thee through thy country we will not pass through the fields or through the vineyards neither will we drink of the water of the wells we will go by the kings high way we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy borders 2018 and edom said unto him thou shalt not pass by me lest i come out against thee with the sword 2019 and the children of israel said unto him we will go by the high way and if i and my cattle drink of thy water then i will pay for it i will only without doing anything else go through on my feet 2020 and he said thou shalt not go through and edom came out against him with much people and with a strong hand 2021 thus edom refused to give israel passage through his border wherefore israel turned away from him 2022 and the children of israel even the whole congregation journeyed from kadesh and came unto mount hor 2023 and the lord spake unto moses and aaron in mount hor by the coast of the land of edom saying 2024 aaron shall be gathered unto his people for he shall not enter into the land which i have given unto the children of israel because ye rebelled against my word at the water of meribah 2025 take aaron and eleazar his son and bring them up unto mount hor 2026 and strip aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die there 2027 and moses did as the lord commanded and they went up into mount hor in the sight of all the congregation 2028 and moses stripped aaron of his garments and put them upon eleazar his son and aaron died there in the top of the mount and moses and eleazar came down from the mount 2029 and when all the congregation saw that aaron was dead they mourned for aaron thirty days even all the house of israel 211 and when king arad the canaanite which dwelt in the south heard tell that israel came by the way of the spies then he fought against israel and took some of them prisoners 212 and israel vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand then i will utterly destroy their cities 213 and the lord hearkened to the voice of israel and delivered up the canaanites and they utterly destroyed them and their cities and he called the name of the place hormah 214 and they journeyed from mount hor by the way of the red sea to compass the land of edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way 215 and the people spake against god and against moses wherefore have ye brought us up out of egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water and our soul loatheth this light bread 216 and the lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of israel died 217 therefore the people came to moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the lord and against thee pray unto the lord that he take away the serpents from us and moses prayed for the people 218 and the lord said unto moses make thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he looketh upon it shall live 219 and moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived 2110 and the children of israel set forward and pitched in oboth 2111 and they journeyed from oboth and pitched at ijeabarim in the wilderness which is before moab toward the sunrising 2112 from thence they removed and pitched in the valley of zared 2113 from thence they removed and pitched on the other side of arnon which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the amorites for arnon is the border of moab between moab and the amorites 2114 wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the lord what he did in the red sea and in the brooks of arnon 2115 and at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of ar and lieth upon the border of moab 2116 and from thence they went to beer that is the well whereof the lord spake unto moses gather the people together and i will give them water 2117 then israel sang this song spring up o well sing ye unto it 2118 the princes digged the well the nobles of the people digged it by the direction of the lawgiver with their staves and from the wilderness they went to mattanah 2119 and from mattanah to nahaliel and from nahaliel to bamoth 2120 and from bamoth in the valley that is in the country of moab to the top of pisgah which looketh toward jeshimon 2121 and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites saying 2122 let me pass through thy land we will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards we will not drink of the waters of the well but we will go along by the kings high way until we be past thy borders 2123 and sihon would not suffer israel to pass through his border but sihon gathered all his people together and went out against israel into the wilderness and he came to jahaz and fought against israel 2124 and israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from arnon unto jabbok even unto the children of ammon for the border of the children of ammon was strong 2125 and israel took all these cities and israel dwelt in all the cities of the amorites in heshbon and in all the villages thereof 2126 for heshbon was the city of sihon the king of the amorites who had fought against the former king of moab and taken all his land out of his hand even unto arnon 2127 wherefore they that speak in proverbs say come into heshbon let the city of sihon be built and prepared 2128 for there is a fire gone out of heshbon a flame from the city of sihon it hath consumed ar of moab and the lords of the high places of arnon 2129 woe to thee moab thou art undone o people of chemosh he hath given his sons that escaped and his daughters into captivity unto sihon king of the amorites 2130 we have shot at them heshbon is perished even unto dibon and we have laid them waste even unto nophah which reacheth unto medeba 2131 thus israel dwelt in the land of the amorites 2132 and moses sent to spy out jaazer and they took the villages thereof and drove out the amorites that were there 2133 and they turned and went up by the way of bashan and og the king of bashan went out against them he and all his people to the battle at edrei 2134 and the lord said unto moses fear him not for i have delivered him into thy hand and all his people and his land and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt at heshbon 2135 so they smote him and his sons and all his people until there was none left him alive and they possessed his land 221 and the children of israel set forward and pitched in the plains of moab on this side jordan by jericho 222 and balak the son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the amorites 223 and moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many and moab was distressed because of the children of israel 224 and moab said unto the elders of midian now shall this company lick up all that are round about us as the ox licketh up the grass of the field and balak the son of zippor was king of the moabites at that time 225 he sent messengers therefore unto balaam the son of beor to pethor which is by the river of the land of the children of his people to call him saying behold there is a people come out from egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over against me 226 come now therefore i pray thee curse me this people for they are too mighty for me peradventure i shall prevail that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land for i wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed and he whom thou cursest is cursed 227 and the elders of moab and the elders of midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand and they came unto balaam and spake unto him the words of balak 228 and he said unto them lodge here this night and i will bring you word again as the lord shall speak unto me and the princes of moab abode with balaam 229 and god came unto balaam and said what men are these with thee 2210 and balaam said unto god balak the son of zippor king of moab hath sent unto me saying 2211 behold there is a people come out of egypt which covereth the face of the earth come now curse me them peradventure i shall be able to overcome them and drive them out 2212 and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed 2213 and balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of balak get you into your land for the lord refuseth to give me leave to go with you 2214 and the princes of moab rose up and they went unto balak and said balaam refuseth to come with us 2215 and balak sent yet again princes more and more honourable than they 2216 and they came to balaam and said to him thus saith balak the son of zippor let nothing i pray thee hinder thee from coming unto me 2217 for i will promote thee unto very great honour and i will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me come therefore i pray thee curse me this people 2218 and balaam answered and said unto the servants of balak if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the word of the lord my god to do less or more 2219 now therefore i pray you tarry ye also here this night that i may know what the lord will say unto me more 2220 and god came unto balaam at night and said unto him if the men come to call thee rise up and go with them but yet the word which i shall say unto thee that shalt thou do 2221 and balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass and went with the princes of moab 2222 and gods anger was kindled because he went and the angel of the lord stood in the way for an adversary against him now he was riding upon his ass and his two servants were with him 2223 and the ass saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and the ass turned aside out of the way and went into the field and balaam smote the ass to turn her into the way 2224 but the angel of the lord stood in a path of the vineyards a wall being on this side and a wall on that side 2225 and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she thrust herself unto the wall and crushed balaams foot against the wall and he smote her again 2226 and the angel of the lord went further and stood in a narrow place where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left 2227 and when the ass saw the angel of the lord she fell down under balaam and balaams anger was kindled and he smote the ass with a staff 2228 and the lord opened the mouth of the ass and she said unto balaam what have i done unto thee that thou hast smitten me these three times 2229 and balaam said unto the ass because thou hast mocked me i would there were a sword in mine hand for now would i kill thee 2230 and the ass said unto balaam am not i thine ass upon which thou hast ridden ever since i was thine unto this day was i ever wont to do so unto thee and he said nay 2231 then the lord opened the eyes of balaam and he saw the angel of the lord standing in the way and his sword drawn in his hand and he bowed down his head and fell flat on his face 2232 and the angel of the lord said unto him wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times behold i went out to withstand thee because thy way is perverse before me 2233 and the ass saw me and turned from me these three times unless she had turned from me surely now also i had slain thee and saved her alive 2234 and balaam said unto the angel of the lord i have sinned for i knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me now therefore if it displease thee i will get me back again 2235 and the angel of the lord said unto balaam go with the men but only the word that i shall speak unto thee that thou shalt speak so balaam went with the princes of balak 2236 and when balak heard that balaam was come he went out to meet him unto a city of moab which is in the border of arnon which is in the utmost coast 2237 and balak said unto balaam did i not earnestly send unto thee to call thee wherefore camest thou not unto me am i not able indeed to promote thee to honour 2238 and balaam said unto balak lo i am come unto thee have i now any power at all to say any thing the word that god putteth in my mouth that shall i speak 2239 and balaam went with balak and they came unto kirjathhuzoth 2240 and balak offered oxen and sheep and sent to balaam and to the princes that were with him 2241 and it came to pass on the morrow that balak took balaam and brought him up into the high places of baal that thence he might see the utmost part of the people 231 and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams 232 and balak did as balaam had spoken and balak and balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram 233 and balaam said unto balak stand by thy burnt offering and i will go peradventure the lord will come to meet me and whatsoever he sheweth me i will tell thee and he went to an high place 234 and god met balaam and he said unto him i have prepared seven altars and i have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram 235 and the lord put a word in balaams mouth and said return unto balak and thus thou shalt speak 236 and he returned unto him and lo he stood by his burnt sacrifice he and all the princes of moab 237 and he took up his parable and said balak the king of moab hath brought me from aram out of the mountains of the east saying come curse me jacob and come defy israel 238 how shall i curse whom god hath not cursed or how shall i defy whom the lord hath not defied 239 for from the top of the rocks i see him and from the hills i behold him lo the people shall dwell alone and shall not be reckoned among the nations 2310 who can count the dust of jacob and the number of the fourth part of israel let me die the death of the righteous and let my last end be like his 2311 and balak said unto balaam what hast thou done unto me i took thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast blessed them altogether 2312 and he answered and said must i not take heed to speak that which the lord hath put in my mouth 2313 and balak said unto him come i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shalt not see them all and curse me them from thence 2314 and he brought him into the field of zophim to the top of pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar 2315 and he said unto balak stand here by thy burnt offering while i meet the lord yonder 2316 and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said go again unto balak and say thus 2317 and when he came to him behold he stood by his burnt offering and the princes of moab with him and balak said unto him what hath the lord spoken 2318 and he took up his parable and said rise up balak and hear hearken unto me thou son of zippor 2319 god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good 2320 behold i have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it 2321 he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in israel the lord his god is with him and the shout of a king is among them 2322 god brought them out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn 2323 surely there is no enchantment against jacob neither is there any divination against israel according to this time it shall be said of jacob and of israel what hath god wrought 2324 behold the people shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a young lion he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain 2325 and balak said unto balaam neither curse them at all nor bless them at all 2326 but balaam answered and said unto balak told not i thee saying all that the lord speaketh that i must do 2327 and balak said unto balaam come i pray thee i will bring thee unto another place peradventure it will please god that thou mayest curse me them from thence 2328 and balak brought balaam unto the top of peor that looketh toward jeshimon 2329 and balaam said unto balak build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams 2330 and balak did as balaam had said and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar 241 and when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel he went not as at other times to seek for enchantments but he set his face toward the wilderness 242 and balaam lifted up his eyes and he saw israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes and the spirit of god came upon him 243 and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath said 244 he hath said which heard the words of god which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open 245 how goodly are thy tents o jacob and thy tabernacles o israel 246 as the valleys are they spread forth as gardens by the rivers side as the trees of lign aloes which the lord hath planted and as cedar trees beside the waters 247 he shall pour the water out of his buckets and his seed shall be in many waters and his king shall be higher than agag and his kingdom shall be exalted 248 god brought him forth out of egypt he hath as it were the strength of an unicorn he shall eat up the nations his enemies and shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows 249 he couched he lay down as a lion and as a great lion who shall stir him up blessed is he that blesseth thee and cursed is he that curseth thee 2410 and balaks anger was kindled against balaam and he smote his hands together and balak said unto balaam i called thee to curse mine enemies and behold thou hast altogether blessed them these three times 2411 therefore now flee thou to thy place i thought to promote thee unto great honour but lo the lord hath kept thee back from honour 2412 and balaam said unto balak spake i not also to thy messengers which thou sentest unto me saying 2413 if balak would give me his house full of silver and gold i cannot go beyond the commandment of the lord to do either good or bad of mine own mind but what the lord saith that will i speak 2414 and now behold i go unto my people come therefore and i will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days 2415 and he took up his parable and said balaam the son of beor hath said and the man whose eyes are open hath said 2416 he hath said which heard the words of god and knew the knowledge of the most high which saw the vision of the almighty falling into a trance but having his eyes open 2417 i shall see him but not now i shall behold him but not nigh there shall come a star out of jacob and a sceptre shall rise out of israel and shall smite the corners of moab and destroy all the children of sheth 2418 and edom shall be a possession seir also shall be a possession for his enemies and israel shall do valiantly 2419 out of jacob shall come he that shall have dominion and shall destroy him that remaineth of the city 2420 and when he looked on amalek he took up his parable and said amalek was the first of the nations but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever 2421 and he looked on the kenites and took up his parable and said strong is thy dwellingplace and thou puttest thy nest in a rock 2422 nevertheless the kenite shall be wasted until asshur shall carry thee away captive 2423 and he took up his parable and said alas who shall live when god doeth this 2424 and ships shall come from the coast of chittim and shall afflict asshur and shall afflict eber and he also shall perish for ever 2425 and balaam rose up and went and returned to his place and balak also went his way 251 and israel abode in shittim and the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters of moab 252 and they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods and the people did eat and bowed down to their gods 253 and israel joined himself unto baalpeor and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel 254 and the lord said unto moses take all the heads of the people and hang them up before the lord against the sun that the fierce anger of the lord may be turned away from israel 255 and moses said unto the judges of israel slay ye every one his men that were joined unto baalpeor 256 and behold one of the children of israel came and brought unto his brethren a midianitish woman in the sight of moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of israel who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation 257 and when phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest saw it he rose up from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand 258 and he went after the man of israel into the tent and thrust both of them through the man of israel and the woman through her belly so the plague was stayed from the children of israel 259 and those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand 2510 and the lord spake unto moses saying 2511 phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest hath turned my wrath away from the children of israel while he was zealous for my sake among them that i consumed not the children of israel in my jealousy 2512 wherefore say behold i give unto him my covenant of peace 2513 and he shall have it and his seed after him even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his god and made an atonement for the children of israel 2514 now the name of the israelite that was slain even that was slain with the midianitish woman was zimri the son of salu a prince of a chief house among the simeonites 2515 and the name of the midianitish woman that was slain was cozbi the daughter of zur he was head over a people and of a chief house in midian 2516 and the lord spake unto moses saying 2517 vex the midianites and smite them 2518 for they vex you with their wiles wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of peor and in the matter of cozbi the daughter of a prince of midian their sister which was slain in the day of the plague for peors sake 261 and it came to pass after the plague that the lord spake unto moses and unto eleazar the son of aaron the priest saying 262 take the sum of all the congregation of the children of israel from twenty years old and upward throughout their fathers house all that are able to go to war in israel 263 and moses and eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying 264 take the sum of the people from twenty years old and upward as the lord commanded moses and the children of israel which went forth out of the land of egypt 265 reuben the eldest son of israel the children of reuben hanoch of whom cometh the family of the hanochites of pallu the family of the palluites 266 of hezron the family of the hezronites of carmi the family of the carmites 267 these are the families of the reubenites and they that were numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven hundred and thirty 268 and the sons of pallu eliab 269 and the sons of eliab nemuel and dathan and abiram this is that dathan and abiram which were famous in the congregation who strove against moses and against aaron in the company of korah when they strove against the lord 2610 and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up together with korah when that company died what time the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men and they became a sign 2611 notwithstanding the children of korah died not 2612 the sons of simeon after their

numbered the children of israel in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho 2664 but among these there was not a man of them whom moses and aaron the priest numbered when they numbered the children

according to all that the lord commanded moses 301 and moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of israel saying this is the thing which the lord hath commanded 302 if a man vow a vow unto the lord or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth 303 if a woman also vow a vow unto the lord and bind herself by a bond being in her fathers house in her youth 304 and her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand 305 but if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth not any of her vows or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand and the lord shall forgive her because her father disallowed her 306 and if she had at all an husband when she vowed or uttered ought out of her lips wherewith she bound her soul 307 and her husband heard it and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it then her vows shall stand and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand 308 but if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it then he shall make her vow which she vowed and that which she uttered with her lips wherewith she bound her soul of none effect and the lord shall forgive her 309 but every vow of a widow and of her that is divorced wherewith they have bound their souls shall stand against her 3010 and if she vowed in her husbands house or bound her soul by a bond with an oath 3011 and her husband heard it and held his peace at her and disallowed her not then all her vows shall stand and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand 3012 but if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning the bond of her soul shall not stand her husband hath made them void and the lord shall forgive her 3013 every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul her husband may establish it or her husband may make it void 3014 but if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day then he establisheth all her vows or all her bonds which are upon her he confirmeth them because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them 3015 but if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them then he shall bear her iniquity 3016 these are the statutes which the lord commanded moses between a man and his wife between the father and his daughter being yet in her youth in her fathers house 311 and the lord spake unto moses saying 312 avenge the children of israel of the midianites afterward shalt thou be gathered unto thy people 313 and moses spake unto the people saying arm some of yourselves unto the war and let them go against the midianites and avenge the lord of midian 314 of every tribe a thousand throughout all the tribes of israel shall ye send to the war 315 so there were delivered out of the thousands of israel a thousand of every tribe twelve thousand armed for war 316 and moses sent them to the war a thousand of every tribe them and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest to the war with the holy instruments and the trumpets to blow in his hand 317 and they warred against the midianites as the lord commanded moses and they slew all the males 318 and they slew the kings of midian beside the rest of them that were slain namely evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba five kings of midian balaam also the son of beor they slew with the sword 319 and the children of israel took all the women of midian captives and their little ones and took the spoil of all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods 3110 and they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt and all their goodly castles with fire 3111 and they took all the spoil and all the prey both of men and of beasts 3112 and they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto moses and eleazar the priest and unto the congregation of the children of israel unto the camp at the plains of moab which are by jordan near jericho 3113 and moses and eleazar the priest and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them without the camp 3114 and moses was wroth with the officers of the host with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds which came from the battle 3115 and moses said unto them have ye saved all the women alive 3116 behold these caused the children of israel through the counsel of balaam to commit trespass against the lord in the matter of peor and there was a plague among the congregation of the lord 3117 now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him 3118 but all the women children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves 3119 and do ye abide without the camp seven days whosoever hath killed any person and whosoever hath touched any slain purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day 3120 and purify all your raiment and all that is made of skins and all work of goats hair and all things made of wood 3121 and eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle this is the ordinance of the law which the lord commanded moses 3122 only the gold and the silver the brass the iron the tin and the lead 3123 every thing that may abide the fire ye shall make it go through the fire and it shall be clean nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water 3124 and ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and ye shall be clean and afterward ye shall come into the camp 3125 and the lord spake unto moses saying 3126 take the sum of the prey that was taken both of man and of beast thou and eleazar the priest and the chief fathers of the congregation 3127 and divide the prey into two parts between them that took the war upon them who went out to battle and between all the congregation 3128 and levy a tribute unto the lord of the men of war which went out to battle one soul of five hundred both of the persons and of the beeves and of the asses and of the sheep 3129 take it of their half and give it unto eleazar the priest for an heave offering of the lord 3130 and of the children of israels half thou shalt take one portion of fifty of the persons of the beeves of the asses and of the flocks of all manner of beasts and give them unto the levites which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the lord 3131 and moses and eleazar the priest did as the lord commanded moses 3132 and the booty being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep 3133 and threescore and twelve thousand beeves 3134 and threescore and one thousand asses 3135 and thirty and two thousand persons in all of women that had not known man by lying with him 3136 and the half which was the portion of them that went out to war was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep 3137 and the lords tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen 3138 and the beeves were thirty and six thousand of which the lords tribute was threescore and twelve 3139 and the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred of which the lords tribute was threescore and one 3140 and the persons were sixteen thousand of which the lords tribute was thirty and two persons 3141 and moses gave the tribute which was the lords heave offering unto eleazar the priest as the lord commanded moses 3142 and of the children of israels half which moses divided from the men that warred 3143 now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep 3144 and thirty and six thousand beeves 3145 and thirty thousand asses and five hundred 3146 and sixteen thousand persons 3147 even of the children of israels half moses took one portion of fifty both of man and of beast and gave them unto the levites which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the lord as the lord commanded moses 3148 and the officers which were over thousands of the host the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds came near unto moses 3149 and they said unto moses thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge and there lacketh not one man of us 3150 we have therefore brought an oblation for the lord what every man hath gotten of jewels of gold chains and bracelets rings earrings and tablets to make an atonement for our souls before the lord 3151 and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of them even all wrought jewels 3152 and all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the lord of the captains of thousands and of the captains of hundreds was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels 3153 for the men of war had taken spoil every man for himself 3154 and moses and eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation for a memorial for the children of israel before the lord 321 now the children of reuben and the children of gad had a very great multitude of cattle and when they saw the land of jazer and the land of gilead that behold the place was a place for cattle 322 the children of gad and the children of reuben came and spake unto moses and to eleazar the priest and unto the princes of the congregation saying 323 ataroth and dibon and jazer and nimrah and heshbon and elealeh and shebam and nebo and beon 324 even the country which the lord smote before the congregation of israel is a land for cattle and thy servants have cattle 325 wherefore said they if we have found grace in thy sight let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession and bring us not over jordan 326 and moses said unto the children of gad and to the children of reuben shall your brethren go to war and shall ye sit here 327 and wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of israel from going over into the land which the lord hath given them 328 thus did your fathers when i sent them from kadeshbarnea to see the land 329 for when they went up unto the valley of eshcol and saw the land they discouraged the heart of the children of israel that they should not go into the land which the lord had given them 3210 and the lords anger was kindled the same time and he sware saying 3211 surely none of the men that came up out of egypt from twenty years old and upward shall see the land which i sware unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob because they have not wholly followed me 3212 save caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite and joshua the son of nun for they have wholly followed the lord 3213 and the lords anger was kindled against israel and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the lord was consumed 3214 and behold ye are risen up in your fathers stead an increase of sinful men to augment yet the fierce anger of the lord toward israel 3215 for if ye turn away from after him he will yet again leave them in the wilderness and ye shall destroy all this people 3216 and they came near unto him and said we will build sheepfolds here for our cattle and cities for our little ones 3217 but we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of israel until we have brought them unto their place and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land 3218 we will not return unto our houses until the children of israel have inherited every man his inheritance 3219 for we will not inherit with them on yonder side jordan or forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side jordan eastward 3220 and moses said unto them if ye will do this thing if ye will go armed before the lord to war 3221 and will go all of you armed over jordan before the lord until he hath driven out his enemies from before him 3222 and the land be subdued before the lord then afterward ye shall return and be guiltless before the lord and before israel and this land shall be your possession before the lord 3223 but if ye will not do so behold ye have sinned against the lord and be sure your sin will find you out 3224 build you cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth 3225 and the children of gad and the children of reuben spake unto moses saying thy servants will do as my lord commandeth 3226 our little ones our wives our flocks and all our cattle shall be there in the cities of gilead 3227 but thy servants will pass over every man armed for war before the lord to battle as my lord saith 3228 so concerning them moses commanded eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of israel 3229 and moses said unto them if the children of gad and the children of reuben will pass with you over jordan every man armed to battle before the lord and the land shall be subdued before you then ye shall give them the land of gilead for a possession 3230 but if they will not pass over with you armed they shall have possessions among you in the land of canaan 3231 and the children of gad and the children of reuben answered saying as the lord hath

out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures and destroy all their molten images and quite pluck down all their high places 3353 and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for i have given you the land to possess it 3354 and ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance every mans inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit 3355 but if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you then it shall come to pass that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell 3356 moreover it shall come to pass that i shall do unto you as i thought to do unto them 341 and the lord spake unto moses saying 342 command the children of israel and say unto them when ye come into the land of canaan this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance even the land of canaan with the coasts thereof 343 then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of zin along by the coast of edom and your south border shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward 344 and your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of akrabbim and pass on to zin and the going forth thereof shall be from the south to kadeshbarnea and shall go on to hazaraddar and pass on to azmon 345 and the border shall fetch a compass

shall be to zedad 349 and the border shall go on to ziphron and the goings out of it shall be at hazarenan this shall be your north border 3410 and ye shall point out your east border from hazarenan to shepham 3411 and the coast shall go down from shepham to riblah on the east side of ain and the border shall descend and shall reach unto the side of the sea of chinnereth eastward 3412 and the border shall go down to jordan and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea this shall be your land with the coasts thereof round about 3413 and moses commanded the children of israel saying this is the land which ye shall inherit by lot which the lord commanded to give unto the nine tribes and to the half tribe 3414 for the tribe of the children of reuben according to the house of their fathers and the tribe of the children of gad according to the house of their fathers have received their inheritance and half the tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance 3415 the two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side jordan near jericho eastward toward the sunrising 3416 and the lord spake unto moses saying 3417 these are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto you eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun 3418 and ye shall take one prince of every tribe to divide the land by inheritance 3419 and the names of the men are these of the tribe of judah caleb the son of jephunneh 3420 and of the tribe of the children of simeon shemuel the son of ammihud 3421 of the tribe of benjamin elidad the son of chislon 3422 and the prince of the tribe of the children of dan bukki the son of jogli 3423 the prince of the children of joseph for the tribe of the children of manasseh hanniel the son of ephod 3424 and the prince of the tribe of the children of ephraim kemuel the son of shiphtan 3425 and the prince of the tribe of the children of zebulun elizaphan the son of parnach 3426 and the prince of the tribe of the children of issachar paltiel the son of azzan 3427 and the prince of the tribe of the children of asher ahihud the son of shelomi 3428 and the prince of the tribe of the children of naphtali pedahel the son of ammihud 3429 these are they whom the lord commanded to divide the inheritance unto the children of israel in the land of canaan 351 and the lord spake unto moses in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho saying 352 command the children of israel that they give unto the levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in and ye shall give also unto the levites suburbs for the cities round about them 353 and the cities shall they have to dwell in and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle and for their goods and for all their beasts 354 and the suburbs of the cities which ye shall give unto the levites shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about 355 and ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits and on the south side two thousand cubits and on the west side two thousand cubits and on the north side two thousand cubits and the city shall be in the midst this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities 356 and among the cities which ye shall give unto the levites there shall be six cities for refuge which ye shall appoint for the manslayer that he may flee thither and to them ye shall add forty and two cities 357 so all the cities which ye shall give to the levites shall be forty and eight cities them shall ye give with their suburbs 358 and the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of israel from them that have many ye shall give many but from them that have few ye shall give few every one shall give of his cities unto the levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth 359 and the lord spake unto moses saying 3510 speak unto the children of israel and say unto them when ye be come over jordan into the land of canaan 3511 then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for you that the slayer may flee thither which killeth any person at unawares 3512 and they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger that the manslayer die not until he stand before the congregation in judgment 3513 and of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye have for refuge 3514 ye shall give three cities on this side jordan and three cities shall ye give in the land of canaan which shall be cities of refuge 3515 these six cities shall be a refuge both for the children of israel and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither 3516 and if he smite him with an instrument of iron so that he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death 3517 and if he smite him with throwing a stone wherewith he may die and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death 3518 or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood wherewith he may die and he die he is a murderer the murderer shall surely be put to death 3519 the revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer when he meeteth him he shall slay him 3520 but if he thrust him of hatred or hurl at him by laying of wait that he die 3521 or in enmity smite him with his hand that he die he that smote him shall surely be put to death for he is a murderer the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer when he meeteth him 3522 but if he thrust him suddenly without enmity or have cast upon him any thing without laying of wait 3523 or with any stone wherewith a man may die seeing him not and cast it upon him that he die and was not his enemy neither sought his harm 3524 then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments 3525 and the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge whither he was fled and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest which was anointed with the holy oil 3526 but if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge whither he was fled 3527 and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge and the revenger of blood kill the slayer he shall not be guilty of blood 3528 because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession 3529 so these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings 3530 whoso killeth any person the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die 3531 moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer which is guilty of death but he shall be surely put to death 3532 and ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge that he should come again to dwell in the land until the death of the priest 3533 so ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are for blood it defileth the land and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein but by the blood of him that shed it 3534 defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit wherein i dwell for i the lord dwell among the children of israel 361 and the chief fathers of the families of the children of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh of the families of the sons of joseph came near and spake before moses and before the princes the chief fathers of the children of israel 362 and they said the lord commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of israel and my lord was commanded by the lord to give the inheritance of zelophehad our brother unto his daughters 363 and if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of israel then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance 364 and when the jubile of the children of israel shall be then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers 365 and moses commanded the children of israel according to the word of the lord saying the tribe of the sons of joseph hath said well 366 this is the thing which the lord doth command concerning the daughters of zelophehad saying let them marry to whom they think best only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry 367 so shall not the inheritance of the children of israel remove from tribe to tribe for every one of the children of israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers 368 and every daughter that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of israel shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father that the children of israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers 369 neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe but every one of the tribes of the children of israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance 3610 even as the lord commanded moses so did the daughters of zelophehad 3611 for mahlah tirzah and hoglah and milcah and noah the daughters of zelophehad were married unto their fathers brothers sons 3612 and they were married into the families of the sons of manasseh the son of joseph and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father 3613 these are the commandments and the judgments which the lord commanded by the hand of moses unto the children of israel in the plains of moab by jordan near jericho the fifth book of moses called deuteronomy 11 these be the words which moses spake unto all israel on this side jordan in the wilderness in the plain over against the red sea between paran and tophel and laban and hazeroth and dizahab 12 there are eleven days journey from horeb by the way of mount seir unto kadeshbarnea 13 and it came to pass in the fortieth year in the eleventh month on the first day of the month that moses spake unto the children of israel according unto all that the lord had given him in commandment unto them 14 after he had slain sihon the king of the amorites which dwelt in heshbon and og the king of bashan which dwelt at astaroth in edrei 15 on this side jordan in the land of moab began moses to declare this law saying 16 the lord our god spake unto us in horeb saying ye have dwelt long enough in this mount 17 turn you and take your journey and go to the mount of the amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto in the plain in the hills and in the vale and in the south and by the sea side to the land of the canaanites and unto lebanon unto the great river the river euphrates 18 behold i have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto your fathers abraham isaac and jacob to give unto them and to their seed after them 19 and i spake unto you at that time saying i am not able to bear you myself alone 110 the lord your god hath multiplied you and behold ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude 111 the lord god of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are and bless you as he hath promised you 112 how can i myself alone bear your cumbrance and your burden and your strife 113 take you wise men and understanding and known among your tribes and i will make them rulers over you 114 and ye answered me and said the thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do 115 so i took the chief of your tribes wise men and known and made them heads over you captains over thousands and captains over hundreds and captains over fifties and captains over tens and officers among your tribes 116 and i charged your judges at that time saying hear the causes between your brethren and judge righteously between every man and his brother and the stranger that is with him 117 ye shall not respect persons in judgment but ye shall hear the small as well as the great ye shall not be afraid of the face of man for the judgment is gods and the cause that is too hard for you bring it unto me and i will hear it 118 and i commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do 119 and when we departed from horeb we went through all that great and terrible wilderness which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the amorites as the lord our god commanded us and we came to kadeshbarnea 120 and i said unto you ye are come unto the mountain of the amorites which the lord our god doth give unto us 121 behold the lord thy god hath set the land before thee go up and possess it as the lord god of thy fathers hath said unto thee fear not neither be discouraged 122 and ye came near unto me every one of you and said we will send men before us and they shall search us out the land and bring us word again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shall come 123 and the saying pleased me well and i took twelve men of you one of a tribe 124 and they turned and went up into the mountain and came unto the valley of eshcol and searched it out 125 and they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down unto us and brought us word again and said it is a good land which the lord our god doth give us 126 notwithstanding ye would not go up but rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god 127 and ye murmured in your tents and said because the lord hated us he hath brought us forth out of the land of egypt to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us 128 whither shall we go up our brethren have discouraged our heart saying the people is greater and taller than we the cities are great and walled up to heaven and moreover we have seen the sons of the anakims there 129 then i said unto you dread not neither be afraid of them 130 the lord your god which goeth before you he shall fight for you according to all that he did for you in egypt before your eyes 131 and in the wilderness where thou hast seen how that the lord thy god bare thee as a man doth bear his son in all the way that ye went until ye came into this place 132 yet in this thing ye did not believe the lord your god 133 who went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents in in fire by night to shew you by what way ye should go and in a cloud by day 134 and the lord heard the voice of your words and was wroth and sware saying 135 surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land which i sware to give unto your fathers 136 save caleb the son of jephunneh he shall see it and to him will i give the land that he hath trodden upon and to his children because he hath wholly followed the lord 137 also the lord was angry with me for your sakes saying thou also shalt not go in thither 138 but joshua the son of nun which standeth before thee he shall go in thither encourage him for he shall cause israel to inherit it 139 moreover your little ones which ye said should be a prey and your children which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil they shall go in thither and unto them will i give it and they shall possess it 140 but as for you turn you and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea 141 then ye answered and said unto me we have sinned against the lord we will go up and fight according to all that the lord our god commanded us and when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war ye were ready to go up into the hill 142 and the lord said unto me say unto them go not up neither fight for i am not among you lest ye be smitten before your enemies 143 so i spake unto you and ye would not hear but rebelled against the commandment of the lord and went presumptuously up into the hill 144 and the amorites which dwelt in that mountain came out against you and chased you as bees do and destroyed you in seir even unto hormah 145 and ye returned and wept before the lord but the lord would not hearken to your voice nor give ear unto you 146 so ye abode in kadesh many days according unto the days that ye abode there 21 then we turned and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the red sea as the lord spake unto me and we compassed mount seir many days 22 and the lord spake unto me saying 23 ye have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward 24 and command thou the people saying ye are to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of esau which dwell in seir and they shall be afraid of you take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore 25 meddle not with them for i will not give you of their land no not so much as a foot breadth because i have given mount seir unto esau for a possession 26 ye shall buy meat of them for money that ye may eat and ye shall also buy water of them for money that ye may drink 27 for the lord thy god hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness these forty years the lord thy god hath been with thee thou hast lacked nothing 28 and when we passed by from our brethren the children of esau which dwelt in seir through the way of the plain from elath and from eziongaber we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of moab 29 and the lord said unto me distress not the moabites neither contend with them in battle for i will not give thee of their land for a possession because i have given ar unto the children of lot for a possession 210 the emims dwelt therein in times past a people great and many and tall as the anakims 211 which also were accounted giants as the anakims but the moabites called them emims 212 the horims also dwelt in seir beforetime but the children of esau succeeded them when they had destroyed them from before them and dwelt in their stead as israel did unto the land of his possession which the lord gave unto them 213 now rise up said i and get you over the brook zered and we went over the brook zered 214 and the space in which we came from kadeshbarnea until we were come over the brook zered was thirty and eight years until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host as the lord sware unto them 215 for indeed the hand of the lord was against them to destroy them from among the host until they were consumed 216 so it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people 217 that the lord spake unto me saying 218 thou art to pass over through ar the coast of moab this day 219 and when thou comest nigh over against the children of ammon distress them not nor meddle with them for i will not give thee of the land of the children of ammon any possession because i have given it unto the children of lot for a possession 220 that also was accounted a land of giants giants dwelt therein in old time and the ammonites call them zamzummims 221 a people great and many and tall as the anakims but the lord destroyed them before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead 222 as he did to the children of esau which dwelt in seir when he destroyed the horims from before them and they succeeded them and dwelt in their stead even unto this day 223 and the avims which dwelt in hazerim even unto azzah the caphtorims which came forth out of caphtor destroyed them and dwelt in their stead 224 rise ye up take your journey and pass over the river arnon behold i have given into thine hand sihon the amorite king of heshbon and his land begin to possess it and contend with him in battle 225 this day will i begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven who shall hear report of thee and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee 226 and i sent messengers out of the wilderness of kedemoth unto sihon king of heshbon with words of peace saying 227 let me pass through thy land i will go along by the high way i will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left 228 thou shalt sell me meat for money that i may eat and give me water for money that i may drink only i will pass through on my feet 229 as the children of esau which dwell in seir and the moabites which dwell in ar did unto me until i shall pass over jordan into the land which the lord our god giveth us 230 but sihon king of heshbon would not let us pass by him for the lord thy god hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate that he might deliver him into thy hand as appeareth this day 231 and the lord said unto me behold i have begun to give sihon and his land before thee begin to possess that thou mayest inherit his land 232 then sihon came out against us he and all his people to fight at jahaz 233 and the lord our god delivered him before us and we smote him and his sons and all his people 234 and we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed the men and the women and the little ones of every city we left none to remain 235 only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we took 236 from aroer which is by the brink of the river of arnon and from the city that is by the river even unto gilead there was not one city too strong for us the lord our god delivered all unto us 237 only unto the land of the children of ammon thou camest not nor unto any place of the river jabbok nor unto the cities in the mountains nor unto whatsoever the lord our god forbad us 31 then we turned and went up the way to bashan and og the king of bashan came out against us he and all his people to battle at edrei 32 and the lord said unto me fear him not for i will deliver him and all his people and his land into thy hand and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto sihon king of the amorites which dwelt at heshbon 33 so the lord our god delivered into our hands og also the king of bashan and all his people and we smote him until none was left to him remaining 34 and we took all his cities at that time there was not a city which we took not from them threescore cities all the region of argob the kingdom of og in bashan 35 all these cities were fenced with high walls gates and bars beside unwalled towns a great many 36 and we utterly destroyed them as we did unto sihon king of heshbon utterly destroying the men women and children of every city 37 but all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for a prey to ourselves 38 and we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the amorites the land that was on this side jordan from the river of arnon unto mount hermon 39 which hermon the sidonians call sirion and the amorites call it shenir 310 all the cities of the plain and all gilead and all bashan unto salchah and edrei cities of the kingdom of og in bashan 311 for only og king of bashan remained of the remnant of giants behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron is it not in rabbath of the children of ammon nine cubits was the length thereof and four cubits the breadth of it after the cubit of a man 312 and this land which we possessed at that time from aroer which is by the river arnon and half mount gilead and the cities thereof gave i unto the reubenites and to the gadites 313 and the rest of gilead and all bashan being the kingdom of og gave i unto the half tribe of manasseh all the region of argob with all bashan which was called the land of giants 314 jair the son of manasseh took all the country of argob unto the coasts of geshuri and maachathi and called them after his own name bashanhavothjair unto this day 315 and i gave gilead unto machir 316 and unto the reubenites and unto the gadites i gave from gilead even unto the river arnon half the valley and the border even unto the river jabbok which is the border of the children of ammon 317 the plain also and jordan and the coast thereof from chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain even the salt sea under ashdothpisgah eastward 318 and i commanded you at that time saying the lord your god hath given you this land to possess it ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of israel all that are meet for the war 319 but your wives and your little ones and your cattle for i know that ye have much cattle shall abide in your cities which i have given you 320 until the lord have given rest unto your brethren as well as unto you and until they also possess the land which the lord your god hath given them beyond jordan and then shall ye return every man unto his possession which i have given you 321 and i commanded joshua at that time saying thine eyes have seen all that the lord your god hath done unto these two kings so shall the lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest 322 ye shall not fear them for the lord your god he shall fight for you 323 and i besought the lord at that time saying 324 o lord god thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand for what god is there in heaven or in earth that can do according to thy works and according to thy might 325 i pray thee let me go over and see the good land that is beyond jordan that goodly mountain and lebanon 326 but the lord was wroth with me for your sakes and would not hear me and the lord said unto me let it suffice thee speak no more unto me of this matter 327 get thee up into the top of pisgah and lift up thine eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward and behold it with thine eyes for thou shalt not go over this jordan 328 but charge joshua and encourage him and strengthen him for he shall go over before this people and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see 329 so we abode in the valley over against bethpeor 41 now therefore hearken o israel unto the statutes and unto the judgments which i teach you for to do them that ye may live and go in and possess the land which the lord god of your fathers giveth you 42 ye shall not add unto the word which i command you neither shall ye diminish ought from it that ye may keep the commandments of the lord your god which i command you 43 your eyes have seen what the lord did because of baalpeor for all the men that followed baalpeor the lord thy god hath destroyed them from among you 44 but ye that did cleave unto the lord your god are alive every one of you this day 45 behold i have taught you statutes and judgments even as the lord my god commanded me that ye should do so in the land whither ye go to possess it 46 keep therefore and do them for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations which shall hear all these statutes and say surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people 47 for what nation is there so great who hath god so nigh unto them as the lord our god is in all things that we call upon him for 48 and what nation is there so great that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which i set before you this day 49 only take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy sons sons 410 specially the day that thou stoodest before the lord thy god in horeb when the lord said unto me gather me the people together and i will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth and that they may teach their children 411 and ye came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven with darkness clouds and thick darkness 412 and the lord spake unto you out of the midst of the fire ye heard the voice of the words but saw no similitude only ye heard a voice 413 and he declared unto you his covenant which he commanded you to perform even ten commandments and he wrote them upon two tables of stone 414 and the lord commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it 415 take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves for ye saw no manner of similitude on the day that the lord spake unto you in horeb out of the midst of the fire 416 lest ye corrupt yourselves and make you a graven image the similitude of any figure the likeness of male or female 417 the likeness of any beast that is on the earth the likeness of any winged fowl that flieth in the air 418 the likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth 419 and lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars even all the host of heaven shouldest be driven to worship them and serve them which the lord thy god hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven 420 but the lord hath taken you and brought you forth out of the iron furnace even out of egypt to be unto him a people of inheritance as ye are this day 421 furthermore the lord was angry with me for your sakes and sware that i should not go over jordan and that i should not go in unto that good land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance 422 but i must die in this land i must not go over jordan but ye shall go over and possess that good land 423 take heed unto yourselves lest ye forget the covenant of the lord your god which he made with you and make you a graven image or the likeness of any thing which the lord thy god hath forbidden thee 424 for the lord thy god is a consuming fire even a jealous god 425 when thou shalt beget children and childrens children and ye shall have remained long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves and make a graven image or the likeness of any thing and shall do evil in the sight of the lord thy god to provoke him to anger 426 i call heaven and earth to witness against you this day that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go over jordan to possess it ye shall not prolong your days upon it but shall utterly be destroyed 427 and the lord shall scatter you among the nations and ye shall be left few in number among the heathen whither the lord shall lead you 428 and there ye shall serve gods the work of mens hands wood and stone which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell 429 but if from thence thou shalt seek the lord thy god thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul 430 when thou art in tribulation and all these things are come upon thee even in the latter days if thou turn to the lord thy god and shalt be obedient unto his voice 431 for the lord thy god is a merciful god he will not forsake thee neither destroy thee nor forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware unto them 432 for ask now of the days that are past which were before thee since the day that god created man upon the earth and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other whether there hath been any such thing as this great thing is or hath been heard like it 433 did ever people hear the voice of god speaking out of the midst of the fire as thou hast heard and live 434 or hath god assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation by temptations by signs and by wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm and by great terrors according to all that the lord your god did for you in egypt before your eyes 435 unto thee it was shewed that thou mightest know that the lord he is god there is none else beside him 436 out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice that he might instruct thee and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire 437 and because he loved thy fathers therefore he chose their seed after them and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of egypt 438 to drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier than thou art to bring thee in to give thee their land for an inheritance as it is this day 439 know therefore this day and consider it in thine heart that the lord he is god in heaven above and upon the earth beneath there is none else 440 thou shalt keep therefore his statutes and his commandments which i command thee this day that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days upon the earth which the lord thy god giveth thee for ever 441 then moses severed three cities on this side jordan toward the sunrising 442 that the slayer might flee thither which should kill his neighbour unawares and hated him not in times past and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live 443 namely bezer in the wilderness in the plain country of the reubenites and ramoth in gilead of the gadites and golan in bashan of the manassites 444 and this is the law which moses set before the children of israel 445 these are the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which moses spake unto the children of israel after they came forth out of egypt 446 on this side jordan in the valley over against bethpeor in the land of sihon king of the amorites who dwelt at heshbon whom moses and the children of israel smote after they were come forth out of egypt 447 and they possessed his land and the land of og king of bashan two kings of the amorites which were on this side jordan toward the sunrising 448 from aroer which is by the bank of the river arnon even unto mount sion which is hermon 449 and all the plain on this side jordan eastward even unto the sea of the plain under the springs of pisgah 51 and moses called all israel and said unto them hear o israel the statutes and judgments which i speak in your ears this day that ye may learn them and keep and do them 52 the lord our god made a covenant with us in horeb 53 the lord made not this covenant with our fathers but with us even us who are all of us here alive this day 54 the lord talked with you face to face in the mount out of the midst of the fire 55 i stood between the lord and you at that time to shew you the word of the lord for ye were afraid by reason of the fire and went not up into the mount saying 56 i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage 57 thou shalt have none other gods before me 58 thou shalt not make thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the waters beneath the earth 59 thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me 510 and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments 511 thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vain for the lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain 512 keep the sabbath day to sanctify it as the lord thy god hath commanded thee 513 six days thou shalt labour and do all thy work 514 but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god in it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter nor thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates that thy manservant and thy maidservant may rest as well as thou 515 and remember that thou wast a servant in the land of egypt and that the lord thy god brought thee out thence through a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm therefore the lord thy god commanded thee to keep the sabbath day 516 honour thy father and thy mother as the lord thy god hath commanded thee that thy days may be prolonged and that it may go well with thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee 517 thou shalt not kill 518 neither shalt thou commit adultery 519 neither shalt thou steal 520 neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour 521 neither shalt thou desire thy neighbours wife neither shalt thou covet thy neighbours house his field or his manservant or his maidservant his ox or his ass or any thing that is thy neighbours 522 these words the lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick darkness with a great voice and he added no more and he wrote them in two tables of stone and delivered them unto me 523 and it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness for the mountain did burn with fire that ye came near unto me even all the heads of your tribes and your elders 524 and ye said behold the lord our god hath shewed us his glory and his greatness and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire we have seen this day that god doth talk with man and he liveth 525 now therefore why should we die for this great fire will consume us if we hear the voice of the lord our god any more then we shall die 526 for who is there of all flesh that hath heard the voice of the living god speaking out of the midst of the fire as we have and lived 527 go thou near and hear all that the lord our god shall say and speak thou unto us all that the lord our god shall speak unto thee and we will hear it and do it 528 and the lord heard the voice of your words when ye spake unto me and the lord said unto me i have heard the voice of the words of this people which they have spoken unto thee they have well said all that they have spoken 529 o that there were such an heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always that it might be well with them and with their children for ever 530 go say to them get you into your tents again 531 but as for thee stand thou here by me and i will speak unto thee all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which thou shalt teach them that they may do them in the land which i give them to possess it 532 ye shall observe to do therefore as the lord your god hath commanded you ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left 533 ye shall walk in all the ways which the lord your god hath commanded you that ye may live and that it may be well with you and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye shall possess 61 now these are the commandments the statutes and the judgments which the lord your god commanded to teach you that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it 62 that thou mightest fear the lord thy god to keep all his statutes and his commandments which i command thee thou and thy son and thy sons son all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolonged 63 hear therefore o israel and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that ye may increase mightily as the lord god of thy fathers hath promised thee in the land that floweth with milk and honey 64 hear o israel the lord our god is one lord 65 and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might 66 and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart 67 and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up 68 and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes 69 and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy gates 610 and it shall be when the lord thy god shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give thee great and goodly cities which thou buildedst not 611 and houses full of all good things which thou filledst not and wells digged which thou diggedst not vineyards and olive trees which thou plantedst not when thou shalt have eaten and be full 612 then beware lest thou forget the lord which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage 613 thou shalt fear the lord thy god and serve him and shalt swear by his name 614 ye shall not go after other gods of the gods of the people which are round about you 615 for the lord thy god is a jealous god among you lest the anger of the lord thy god be kindled against thee and destroy thee from off the face of the earth 616 ye shall not tempt the lord your god as ye tempted him in massah 617 ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the lord your god and his testimonies and his statutes which he hath commanded thee 618 and thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the lord that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the lord sware unto thy fathers 619 to cast out all thine enemies from before thee as the lord hath spoken 620 and when thy son asketh thee in time to come saying what mean the testimonies and the statutes and the judgments which the lord our god hath commanded you 621 then thou shalt say unto thy son we were pharaohs bondmen in egypt and the lord brought us out of egypt with a mighty hand 622 and the lord shewed signs and wonders great and sore upon egypt upon pharaoh and upon all his household before our eyes 623 and he brought us out from thence that he might bring us in to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers 624 and the lord commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the lord our god for our good always that he might preserve us alive as it is at this day 625 and it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these commandments before the lord our god as he hath commanded us 71 when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it and hath cast out many nations before thee the hittites and the girgashites and the amorites and the canaanites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites seven nations greater and mightier than thou 72 and when the lord thy god shall deliver them before thee thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them thou shalt make no covenant with them nor shew mercy unto them 73 neither shalt thou make marriages with them thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son 74 for they will turn away thy son from following me that they may serve other gods so will the anger of the lord be kindled against you and destroy thee suddenly 75 but thus shall ye deal with them ye shall destroy their altars and break down their images and cut down their groves and burn their graven images with fire 76 for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god the lord thy god hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth 77 the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because ye were more in number than any people for ye were the fewest of all people 78 but because the lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers hath the lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt 79 know therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations 710 and repayeth them that hate him to their face to destroy them he will not be slack to him that hateth him he will repay him to his face 711 thou shalt therefore keep the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which i command thee this day to do them 712 wherefore it shall come to pass if ye hearken to these judgments and keep and do them that the lord thy god shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers 713 and he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee he will also bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land thy corn and thy wine and thine oil the increase of thy kine and the flocks of thy sheep in the land which he sware unto thy fathers to give thee 714 thou shalt be blessed above all people there shall not be male or female barren among you or among your cattle 715 and the lord will take away from thee all sickness and will put none of the evil diseases of egypt which thou knowest upon thee but will lay them upon all them that hate thee 716 and thou shalt consume all the people which the lord thy god shall deliver thee thine eye shall have no pity upon them neither shalt thou serve their gods for that will be a snare unto thee 717 if thou shalt say in thine heart these nations are more than i how can i dispossess them 718 thou shalt not be afraid of them but shalt well remember what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh and unto all egypt 719 the great temptations which thine eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the stretched out arm whereby the lord thy god brought thee out so shall the lord thy god do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid 720 moreover the lord thy god will send the hornet among them until they that are left and hide themselves from thee be destroyed 721 thou shalt not be affrighted at them for the lord thy god is among you a mighty god and terrible 722 and the lord thy god will put out those nations before thee by little and little thou mayest not consume them at once lest the beasts of the field increase upon thee 723 but the lord thy god shall deliver them unto thee and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction until they be destroyed 724 and he shall deliver their kings into thine hand and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven there shall no man be able to stand before thee until thou have destroyed them 725 the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them nor take it unto thee lest thou be snared therin for it is an abomination to the lord thy god 726 neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house lest thou be a cursed thing like it but thou shalt utterly detest it and thou shalt utterly abhor it for it is a cursed thing 81 all the commandments which i command thee this day shall ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto your fathers 82 and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or no 83 and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live 84 thy raiment waxed not old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these forty years 85 thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth his son so the lord thy god chasteneth thee 86 therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god to walk in his ways and to fear him 87 for the lord thy god bringeth thee into a good land a land of brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills 88 a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates a land of oil olive and honey 89 a land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness thou shalt not lack any thing in it a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass 810 when thou hast eaten and art full then thou shalt bless the lord thy god for the good land which he hath given thee 811 beware that thou forget not the lord thy god in not keeping his commandments and his judgments and his statutes which i command thee this day 812 lest when thou hast eaten and art full and hast built goodly houses and dwelt therein 813 and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied and all that thou hast is multiplied 814 then thine heart be lifted up and thou forget the lord thy god which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage 815 who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness wherein were fiery serpents and scorpions and drought where there was no water who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint 816 who fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not that he might humble thee and that he might prove thee to do thee good at thy latter end 817 and thou say in thine heart my power and the might of mine hand hath gotten me this wealth 818 but thou shalt remember the lord thy god for it is he that giveth thee power to get wealth that he may establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers as it is this day 819 and it shall be if thou do at all forget the lord thy god and walk after other gods and serve them and worship them i testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish 820 as the nations which the lord destroyeth before your face so shall ye perish because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the lord your god 91 hear o israel thou art to pass over jordan this day to go in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself cities great and fenced up to heaven 92 a people great and tall the children of the anakims whom thou knowest and of whom thou hast heard say who can stand before the children of anak 93 understand therefore this day that the lord thy god is he which goeth over before thee as a consuming fire he shall destroy them and he shall bring them down before thy face so shalt thou drive them out and destroy them quickly as the lord hath said unto thee 94 speak not thou in thine heart after that the lord thy god hath cast them out from before thee saying for my righteousness the lord hath brought me in to possess this land but for the wickedness of these nations the lord doth drive them out from before thee 95 not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart dost thou go to possess their land but for the wickedness of these nations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee and that he may perform the word which the lord sware unto thy fathers abraham isaac and jacob 96 understand therefore that the lord thy god giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness for thou art a stiffnecked people 97 remember and forget not how thou provokedst the lord thy god to wrath in the wilderness from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of egypt until ye came unto this place ye have been rebellious against the lord 98 also in horeb ye provoked the lord to wrath so that the lord was angry with you to have destroyed you 99 when i was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone even the tables of the covenant which the lord made with you then i abode in the mount forty days and forty nights i neither did eat bread nor drink water 910 and the lord delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of god and on them was written according to all the words which the lord spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly 911 and it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that the lord gave me the two tables of stone even the tables of the covenant 912 and the lord said unto me arise get thee down quickly from hence for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of egypt have corrupted themselves they are quickly turned aside out of the way which i commanded them they have made them a molten image 913 furthermore the lord spake unto me saying i have seen this people and behold it is a stiffnecked people 914 let me alone that i may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven and i will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they 915 so i turned and came down from the mount and the mount burned with fire and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands 916 and i looked and behold ye had sinned against the lord your god and had made you a molten calf ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the lord had commanded you 917 and i took the two tables and cast them out of my two hands and brake them before your eyes 918 and i fell down before the lord as at the first forty days and forty nights i did neither eat bread nor drink water because of all your sins which ye sinned in doing wickedly in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger 919 for i was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure wherewith the lord was wroth against you to destroy you but the lord hearkened unto me at that time also 920 and the lord was very angry with aaron to have destroyed him and i prayed for aaron also the same time 921 and i took your sin the calf which ye had made and burnt it with fire and stamped it and ground it very small even until it was as small as dust and i cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount 922 and at taberah and at massah and at kibrothhattaavah ye provoked the lord to wrath 923 likewise when the lord sent you from kadeshbarnea saying go up and possess the land which i have given you then ye rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god and ye believed him not nor hearkened to his voice 924 ye have been rebellious against the lord from the day that i knew you 925 thus i fell down before the lord forty days and forty nights as i fell down at the first because the lord had said he would destroy you 926 i prayed therefore unto the lord and said o lord god destroy not thy people and thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness which thou hast brought forth out of egypt with a mighty hand 927 remember thy servants abraham isaac and jacob look not unto the stubbornness of this people nor to their wickedness nor to their sin 928 lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say because the lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them and because he hated them he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness 929 yet they are thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm 101 at that time the lord said unto me hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first and come up unto me into the mount and make thee an ark of wood 102 and i will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest and thou shalt put them in the ark 103 and i made an ark of shittim wood and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first and went up into the mount having the two tables in mine hand 104 and he wrote on the tables according to the first writing the ten commandments which the lord spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly and the lord gave them unto me 105 and i turned myself and came down from the mount and put the tables in the ark which i had made and there they be as the lord commanded me 106 and the children of israel took their journey from beeroth of the children of jaakan to mosera there aaron died and there he was buried and eleazar his son ministered in the priests office in his stead 107 from thence they journeyed unto gudgodah and from gudgodah to jotbath a land of rivers of waters 108 at that time the lord separated the tribe of levi to bear the ark of the covenant of the lord to stand before the lord to minister unto him and to bless in his name unto this day 109 wherefore levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren the lord is his inheritance according as the lord thy god promised him 1010 and i stayed in the mount according to the first time forty days and forty nights and the lord hearkened unto me at that time also and the lord would not destroy thee 1011 and the lord said unto me arise take thy journey before the people that they may go in and possess the land which i sware unto their fathers to give unto them 1012 and now israel what doth the lord thy god require of thee but to fear the lord thy god to walk in all his ways and to love him and to serve the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul 1013 to keep the commandments of the lord and his statutes which i command thee this day for thy good 1014 behold the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the lords thy god the earth also with all that therein is 1015 only the lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them and he chose their seed after them even you above all people as it is this day 1016 circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart and be no more stiffnecked 1017 for the lord your god is god of gods and lord of lords a great god a mighty and a terrible which regardeth not persons nor taketh reward 1018 he doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow and loveth the stranger in giving him food and raiment 1019 love ye therefore the stranger for ye were strangers in the land of egypt 1020 thou shalt fear the lord thy god him shalt thou serve and to him shalt thou cleave and swear by his name 1021 he is thy praise and he is thy god that hath done for thee these great and terrible things which thine eyes have seen 1022 thy fathers went down into egypt with threescore and ten persons and now the lord thy god hath made thee as the stars of heaven for multitude 111 therefore thou shalt love the lord thy god and keep his charge and his statutes and his judgments and his commandments alway 112 and know ye this day for i speak not with your children which have not known and which have not seen the chastisement of the lord your god his greatness his mighty hand and his stretched out arm 113 and his miracles and his acts which he did in the midst of egypt unto pharaoh the king of egypt and unto all his land 114 and what he did unto the army of egypt unto their horses and to their chariots how he made the water of the red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you and how the lord hath destroyed them unto this day 115 and what he did unto you in the wilderness until ye came into this place 116 and what he did unto dathan and abiram the sons of eliab the son of reuben how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their households and their tents and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all israel 117 but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the lord which he did 118 therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which i command you this day that ye may be strong and go in and possess the land whither ye go to possess it 119 and that ye may prolong your days in the land which the lord sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed a land that floweth with milk and honey 1110 for the land whither thou goest in to possess it is not as the land of egypt from whence ye came out where thou sowedst thy seed and wateredst it with thy foot as a garden of herbs 1111 but the land whither ye go to possess it is a land of hills and valleys and drinketh water of the rain of heaven 1112 a land which the lord thy god careth for the eyes of the lord thy god are always upon it from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year 1113 and it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which i command you this day to love the lord your god and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul 1114 that i will give you the rain of your land in his due season the first rain and the latter rain that thou mayest gather in thy corn and thy wine and thine oil 1115 and i will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and be full 1116 take heed to yourselves that your heart be not deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods and worship them 1117 and then the lords wrath be kindled against you and he shut up the heaven that there be no rain and that the land yield not her fruit and lest ye perish quickly from off the good land which the lord giveth you 1118 therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be as frontlets between your eyes 1119 and ye shall teach them your children speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way when thou liest down and when thou risest up 1120 and thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house and upon thy gates 1121 that your days may be multiplied and the days of your children in the land which the lord sware unto your fathers to give them as the days of heaven upon the earth 1122 for if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which i command you to do them to love the lord your god to walk in all his ways and to cleave unto him 1123 then will the lord drive out all these nations from before you and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than yourselves 1124 every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the wilderness and lebanon from the river the river euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be 1125 there shall no man be able to stand before you for the lord your god shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon as he hath said unto you 1126 behold i set before you this day a blessing and a curse 1127 a blessing if ye obey the commandments of the lord your god which i command you this day 1128 and a curse if ye will not obey the commandments of the lord your god but turn aside out of the way which i command you this day to go after other gods which ye have not known 1129 and it shall come to pass when the lord thy god hath brought thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it that thou shalt put the blessing upon mount gerizim and the curse upon mount ebal 1130 are they not on the other side jordan by the way where the sun goeth down in the land of the canaanites which dwell in the champaign over against gilgal beside the plains of moreh 1131 for ye shall pass over jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you and ye shall possess it and dwell therein 1132 and ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments which i set before you this day 121 these are the statutes and judgments which ye shall observe to do in the land which the lord god of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it all the days that ye live upon the earth 122 ye shall utterly destroy all the places wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every green tree 123 and ye shall overthrow their altars and break their pillars and burn their groves with fire and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place 124 ye shall not do so unto the lord your god 125 but unto the place which the lord your god shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there even unto his habitation shall ye seek and thither thou shalt come 126 and thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and heave offerings of your hand and your vows and your freewill offerings and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks 127 and there ye shall eat before the lord your god and ye shall rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto ye and your households wherein the lord thy god hath blessed thee 128 ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes 129 for ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance which the lord your god giveth you 1210 but when ye go over jordan and dwell in the land which the lord your god giveth you to inherit and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about so that ye dwell in safety 1211 then there shall be a place which the lord your god shall choose to cause his name to dwell there thither shall ye bring all that i command you your burnt offerings and your sacrifices your tithes and the heave offering of your hand and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the lord 1212 and ye shall rejoice before the lord your god ye and your sons and your daughters and your menservants and your maidservants and the levite that is within your gates forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you 1213 take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou seest 1214 but in the place which the lord shall choose in one of thy tribes there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings and there thou shalt do all that i command thee 1215 notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after according to the blessing of the lord thy god which he hath given thee the unclean and the clean may eat thereof as of the roebuck and as of the hart 1216 only ye shall not eat the blood ye shall pour it upon the earth as water 1217 thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn or of thy wine or of thy oil or the firstlings of thy herds or of thy flock nor any of thy vows which thou vowest nor thy freewill offerings or heave offering of thine hand 1218 but thou must eat them before the lord thy god in the place which the lord thy god shall choose thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and thy maidservant and the levite that is within thy gates and thou shalt rejoice before the lord thy god in all that thou puttest thine hands unto 1219 take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the levite as long as thou livest upon the earth 1220 when the lord thy god shall enlarge thy border as he hath promised thee and thou shalt say i will eat flesh because thy soul longeth to eat flesh thou mayest eat flesh whatsoever thy soul lusteth after 1221 if the place which the lord thy god hath chosen to put his name there be too far from thee then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock which the lord hath given thee as i have commanded thee and thou shalt eat in thy gates whatsoever thy soul lusteth after 1222 even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten so thou shalt eat them the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike 1223 only be sure that thou eat not the blood for the blood is the life and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh 1224 thou shalt not eat it thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water 1225 thou shalt not eat it that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the lord 1226 only thy holy things which thou hast and thy vows thou shalt take and go unto the place which the lord shall choose 1227 and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings the flesh and the blood upon the altar of the lord thy god and the blood of thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the lord thy god and thou shalt eat the flesh 1228 observe and hear all these words which i command thee that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee for ever when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the lord thy god 1229 when the lord thy god shall cut off the nations from before thee whither thou goest to possess them and thou succeedest them and dwellest in their land 1230 take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following them after that they be destroyed from before thee and that thou enquire not after their gods saying how did these nations serve their gods even so will i do likewise 1231 thou shalt not do so unto the lord thy god for every abomination to the lord which he hateth have they done unto their gods for even their sons and their daughters they have burnt in the fire to their gods 1232 what thing soever i command you observe to do it thou shalt not add thereto nor diminish from it 131 if there arise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and giveth thee a sign or a wonder 132 and the sign or the wonder come to pass whereof he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou hast not known and let us serve them 133 thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the lord your god proveth you to know whether ye love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul 134 ye shall walk after the lord your god and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice and ye shall serve him and cleave unto him 135 and that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death because he hath spoken to turn you away from the lord your god which brought you out of the land of egypt and redeemed you out of the house of bondage to thrust thee out of the way which the lord thy god commanded thee to walk in so shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee 136 if thy brother the son of thy mother or thy son or thy daughter or the wife of thy bosom or thy friend which is as thine own soul entice thee secretly saying let us go and serve other gods which thou hast not known thou nor thy fathers 137 namely of the gods of the people which are round about you nigh unto thee or far off from thee from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth 138 thou shalt not consent unto him nor hearken unto him neither shall thine eye pity him neither shalt thou spare neither shalt thou conceal him 139 but thou shalt surely kill him thine hand shall be first upon him to put him to death and afterwards the hand of all the people 1310 and thou shalt stone him with stones that he die because he hath sought to thrust thee away from the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage 1311 and all israel shall hear and fear and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you 1312 if thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities which the lord thy god hath given thee to dwell there saying 1313 certain men the children of belial are gone out from among you and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city saying let us go and serve other gods which ye have not known 1314 then shalt thou enquire and make search and ask diligently and behold if it be truth and the thing certain that such abomination is wrought among you 1315 thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword destroying it utterly and all that is therein and the cattle thereof with the edge of the sword 1316 and thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof and shalt burn with fire the city and all the spoil thereof every whit for the lord thy god and it shall be an heap for ever it shall not be built again 1317 and there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine hand that the lord may turn from the fierceness of his anger and shew thee mercy and have compassion upon thee and multiply thee as he hath sworn unto thy fathers 1318 when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the lord thy god to keep all his commandments which i command thee this day to do that which is right in the eyes of the lord thy god 141 ye are the children of the lord your god ye shall not cut yourselves nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead 142 for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god and the lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself above all the nations that are upon the earth 143 thou shalt not eat any abominable thing 144 these are the beasts which ye shall eat the ox the sheep and the goat 145 the hart and the roebuck and the fallow deer and the wild goat and the pygarg and the wild ox and the chamois 146 and every beast that parteth the hoof and cleaveth the cleft into two claws and cheweth the cud among the beasts that ye shall eat 147 nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud or of them that divide the cloven hoof as the camel and the hare and the coney for they chew the cud but divide not the hoof therefore they are unclean unto you 148 and the swine because it divideth the hoof yet cheweth not the cud it is unclean unto you ye shall not eat of their flesh nor touch their dead carcase 149 these ye shall eat of all that are in the waters all that have fins and scales shall ye eat 1410 and whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat it is unclean unto you 1411 of all clean birds ye shall eat 1412 but these are they of which ye shall not eat the eagle and the ossifrage and the ospray 1413 and the glede and the kite and the vulture after his kind 1414 and every raven after his kind 1415 and the owl and the night hawk and the cuckow and the hawk after his kind 1416 the little owl and the great owl and the swan 1417 and the pelican and the gier eagle and the cormorant 1418 and the stork and the heron after her kind and the lapwing and the bat 1419 and every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you they shall not be eaten 1420 but of all clean fowls ye may eat 1421 ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates that he may eat it or thou mayest sell it unto an alien for thou art an holy people unto the lord thy god thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mothers milk 1422 thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed that the field bringeth forth year by year 1423 and thou shalt eat before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose to place his name there the tithe of thy corn of thy wine and of thine oil and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks that thou mayest learn to fear the lord thy god always 1424 and if the way be too long for thee so that thou art not able to carry it or if the place be too far from thee which the lord thy god shall choose to set his name there when the lord thy god hath blessed thee 1425 then shalt thou turn it into money and bind up the money in thine hand and shalt go unto the place which the lord thy god shall choose 1426 and thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul lusteth after for oxen or for sheep or for wine or for strong drink or for whatsoever thy soul desireth and thou shalt eat there before the lord thy god and thou shalt rejoice thou and thine household 1427 and the levite that is within thy gates thou shalt not forsake him for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee 1428 at the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year and shalt lay it up within thy gates 1429 and the levite because he hath no part nor inheritance with thee and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow which are within thy gates shall come and shall eat and be satisfied that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of thine hand which thou doest 151 at the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release 152 and this is the manner of the release every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it he shall not exact it of his neighbour or of his brother because it is called the lords release 153 of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again but that which is thine with thy brother thine hand shall release 154 save when there shall be no poor among you for the lord shall greatly bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it 155 only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all these commandments which i command thee this day 156 for the lord thy god blesseth thee as he promised thee and thou shalt lend unto many nations but thou shalt not borrow and thou shalt reign over many nations but they shall not reign over thee 157 if there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy gates in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee thou shalt not harden thine heart nor shut thine hand from thy poor brother 158 but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need in that which he wanteth 159 beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart saying the seventh year the year of release is at hand and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother and thou givest him nought and he cry unto the lord against thee and it be sin unto thee 1510 thou shalt surely give him and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him because that for this thing the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thy works and in all that thou puttest thine hand unto 1511 for the poor shall never cease out of the land therefore i command thee saying thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother to thy poor and to thy needy in thy land 1512 and if thy brother an hebrew man or an hebrew woman be sold unto thee and serve thee six years then in the seventh year thou shalt let him go free from thee 1513 and when thou sendest him out free from thee thou shalt not let him go away empty 1514 thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock and out of thy floor and out of thy winepress of that wherewith the lord thy god hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him 1515 and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt and the lord thy god redeemed thee therefore i command thee this thing to day 1516 and it shall be if he say unto thee i will not go away from thee because he loveth thee and thine house because he is well with thee 1517 then thou shalt take an aul and thrust it through his ear unto the door and he shall be thy servant for ever and also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise 1518 it shall not seem hard unto thee when thou sendest him away free from thee for he hath been worth a double hired servant to thee in serving thee six years and the lord thy god shall bless thee in all that thou doest 1519 all the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the lord thy god thou shalt do no work with the firstling of thy bullock nor shear the firstling of thy sheep 1520 thou shalt eat it before the lord thy god year by year in the place which the lord shall choose thou and thy household 1521 and if there be any blemish therein as if it be lame or blind or have any ill blemish thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the lord thy god 1522 thou shalt eat it within thy gates the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike as the roebuck and as the hart 1523 only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water 161 observe the month of abib and keep the passover unto the lord thy god for in the month of abib the lord thy god brought thee forth out of egypt by night 162 thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the lord thy god of the flock and the herd in the place which the lord shall choose to place his name there 163 thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith even the bread of affliction for thou camest forth out of the land of egypt in haste that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of egypt all the days of thy life 164 and there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy coast seven days neither shall there any thing of the flesh which thou sacrificedst the first day at even remain all night until the morning 165 thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates which the lord thy god giveth thee 166 but at the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name in there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even at the going down of the sun at the season that thou camest forth out of egypt 167 and thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the lord thy god shall choose and thou shalt turn in the morning and go unto thy tents 168 six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the lord thy god thou shalt do no work therein 169 seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn 1610 and thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the lord thy god with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand which thou shalt give unto the lord thy god according as the lord thy god hath blessed thee 1611 and thou shalt rejoice before the lord thy god thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and thy maidservant and the levite that is within thy gates and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow that are among you in the place which the lord thy god hath chosen to place his name there 1612 and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in egypt and thou shalt observe and do these statutes 1613 thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days after that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine 1614 and thou shalt rejoice in thy feast thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manservant and thy maidservant and the levite the stranger and the fatherless and the widow that are within thy gates 1615 seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the lord thy god in the place which the lord shall choose because the lord thy god shall bless thee in all thine increase and in all the works of thine hands therefore thou shalt surely rejoice 1616 three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles and they shall not appear before the lord empty 1617 every man shall give as he is able according to the blessing of the lord thy god which he hath given thee 1618 judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates which the lord thy god giveth thee throughout thy tribes and they shall judge the people with just judgment 1619 thou shalt not wrest judgment thou shalt not respect persons neither take a gift for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise and pervert the words of the righteous 1620 that which is altogether just shalt thou follow that thou mayest live and inherit the land which the lord thy god giveth thee 1621 thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the lord thy god which thou shalt make thee 1622 neither shalt thou set thee up any image which the lord thy god hateth 171 thou shalt not sacrifice unto the lord thy god any bullock or sheep wherein is blemish or any evilfavouredness for that is an abomination unto the lord thy god 172 if there be found among you within any of thy gates which the lord thy god giveth thee man or woman that hath wrought wickedness in the sight of the lord thy god in transgressing his covenant 173 and hath gone and served other gods and worshipped them either the sun or moon or any of the host of heaven which i have not commanded 174 and it be told thee and thou hast heard of it and enquired diligently and behold it be true and the thing certain that such abomination is wrought in israel 175 then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman which have committed that wicked thing unto thy gates even that man or that woman and shalt stone them with stones till they die 176 at the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses shall he that is worthy of death be put to death but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death 177 the hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death and afterward the hands of all the people so thou shalt put the evil away from among you 178 if there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment between blood and blood between plea and plea and between stroke and stroke being matters of controversy within thy gates then shalt thou arise and get thee up into the place which the lord thy god shall choose 179 and thou shalt come unto the priests the levites and unto the judge that shall be in those days and enquire and they shall shew thee the sentence of judgment 1710 and thou shalt do according to the sentence which they of that place which the lord shall choose shall shew thee and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform thee 1711 according to the sentence of the law which they shall teach thee and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee thou shalt do thou shalt not decline from the sentence which they shall shew thee to the right hand nor to the left 1712 and the man that will do presumptuously and will not hearken unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the lord thy god or unto the judge even that man shall die and thou shalt put away the evil from israel 1713 and all the people shall hear and fear and do no more presumptuously 1714 when thou art come unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee and shalt possess it and shalt dwell therein and shalt say i will set a king over me like as all the nations that are about me 1715 thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee whom the lord thy god shall choose one from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee thou mayest not set a stranger over thee which is not thy brother 1716 but he shall not multiply horses to himself nor cause the people to return to egypt to the end that he should multiply horses forasmuch as the lord hath said unto you ye shall henceforth return no more that way 1717 neither shall he multiply wives to himself that his heart turn not away neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold 1718 and it shall be when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the levites 1719 and it shall be with him and he shall read therein all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the lord his god to keep all the words of this law and these statutes to do them 1720 that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren and that he turn not aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom he and his children in the midst of israel 181 the priests the levites and all the tribe of levi shall have no part nor inheritance with israel they shall eat the offerings of the lord made by fire and his inheritance 182 therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren the lord is their inheritance as he hath said unto them 183 and this shall be the priests due from the people from them that offer a sacrifice whether it be ox or sheep and they shall give unto the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the maw 184 the firstfruit also of thy corn of thy wine and of thine oil and the first of the fleece of thy sheep shalt thou give him 185 for the lord thy god hath chosen him out of all thy tribes to stand to minister in the name of the lord him and his sons for ever 186 and if a levite come from any of thy gates out of all israel where he sojourned and come with all the desire of his mind unto the place which the lord shall choose 187 then he shall minister in the name of the lord his god as all his brethren the levites do which stand there before the lord 188 they shall have like portions to eat beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony 189 when thou art come into the land which the lord thy god giveth thee thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations 1810 there shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire or that useth divination or an observer of times or an enchanter or a witch 1811 or a charmer or a consulter with familiar spirits or a wizard or a necromancer 1812 for all that do these things are an abomination unto the lord and because of these abominations the lord thy god doth drive them out from before thee 1813 thou shalt be perfect with the lord thy god 1814 for these nations which thou shalt possess hearkened unto observers of times and unto diviners but as for thee the lord thy god hath not suffered thee so to do 1815 the lord thy god will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren like unto me unto him ye shall hearken 1816 according to all that thou desiredst of the lord thy god in horeb in the day of the assembly saying let me not hear again the voice of the lord my god neither let me see this great fire any more that i die not 1817 and the lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken 1818 i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him 1819 and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him 1820 but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which i have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that prophet shall die 1821 and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the lord hath not spoken 1822 when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is the thing which the lord hath not spoken but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him 191 when the lord thy god hath cut off the nations whose land the lord thy god giveth thee and thou succeedest them and dwellest in their cities and in their houses 192 thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it 193 thou shalt prepare thee a way and divide the coasts of thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee to inherit into three parts that every slayer may flee thither 194 and this is the case of the slayer which shall flee thither that he may live whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly whom he hated not in time past 195 as when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew wood and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree and the head slippeth from the helve and lighteth upon his neighbour that he die he shall flee unto one of those cities and live 196 lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer while his heart is hot and overtake him because the way is long and slay him whereas he was not worthy of death inasmuch as he hated him not in time past 197 wherefore i command thee saying thou shalt separate three cities for thee 198 and if the lord thy god enlarge thy coast as he hath sworn unto thy fathers and give thee all the land which he promised to give unto thy fathers 199 if thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them which i command thee this day to love the lord thy god and to walk ever in his ways then shalt thou add three cities more for thee beside these three 1910 that innocent blood be not shed in thy land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance and so blood be upon thee 1911 but if any man hate his neighbour and lie in wait for him and rise up against him and smite him mortally that he die and fleeth into one of these cities 1912 then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood that he may die 1913 thine eye shall not pity him but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from israel that it may go well with thee 1914 thou shalt not remove thy neighbours landmark which they of old time have set in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in the land that the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it 1915 one witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity or for any sin in any sin that he sinneth at the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses shall the matter be established 1916 if a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong 1917 then both the men between whom the controversy is shall stand before the lord before the priests and the judges which shall be in those days 1918 and the judges shall make diligent inquisition and behold if the witness be a false witness and hath testified falsely against his brother 1919 then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother so shalt thou put the evil away from among you 1920 and those which remain shall hear and fear and shall henceforth commit no more any such evil among you 1921 and thine eye shall not pity but life shall go for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot 201 when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and seest horses and chariots and a people more than thou be not afraid of them for the lord thy god is with thee which brought thee up out of the land of egypt 202 and it shall be when ye are come nigh unto the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people 203 and shall say unto them hear o israel ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble neither be ye terrified because of them 204 for the lord your god is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you 205 and the officers shall speak unto the people saying what man is there that hath built a new house and hath not dedicated it let him go and return to his house lest he die in the battle and another man dedicate it 206 and what man is he that hath planted a vineyard and hath not yet eaten of it let him also go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man eat of it 207 and what man is there that hath betrothed a wife and hath not taken her let him go and return unto his house lest he die in the battle and another man take her 208 and the officers shall speak further unto the people and they shall say what man is there that is fearful and fainthearted let him go and return unto his house lest his brethrens heart faint as well as his heart 209 and it shall be when the officers have made an end of speaking unto the people that they shall make captains of the armies to lead the people 2010 when thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it then proclaim peace unto it 2011 and it shall be if it make thee answer of peace and open unto thee then it shall be that all the people that is found therein shall be tributaries unto thee and they shall serve thee 2012 and if it will make no peace with thee but will make war against thee then thou shalt besiege it 2013 and when the lord thy god hath delivered it into thine hands thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the sword 2014 but the women and the little ones and the cattle and all that is in the city even all the spoil thereof shalt thou take unto thyself and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine enemies which the lord thy god hath given thee 2015 thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee which are not of the cities of these nations 2016 but of the cities of these people which the lord thy god doth give thee for an inheritance thou shalt save alive nothing that breatheth 2017 but thou shalt utterly destroy them namely the hittites and the amorites the canaanites and the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites as the lord thy god hath commanded thee 2018 that they teach you not to do after all their abominations which they have done unto their gods so should ye sin against the lord your god 2019 when thou shalt besiege a city a long time in making war against it to take it thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them for thou mayest eat of them and thou shalt not cut them down for the tree of the field is mans life to employ them in the siege 2020 only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for meat thou shalt destroy and cut them down and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee until it be subdued 211 if one be found slain in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee to possess it lying in the field and it be not known who hath slain him 212 then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain 213 and it shall be that the city which is next unto the slain man even the elders of that city shall take an heifer which hath not been wrought with and which hath not drawn in the yoke 214 and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley which is neither eared nor sown and shall strike off the heifers neck there in the valley 215 and the priests the sons of levi shall come near for them the lord thy god hath chosen to minister unto him and to bless in the name of the lord and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried 216 and all the elders of that city that are next unto the slain man shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley 217 and they shall answer and say our hands have not shed this blood neither have our eyes seen it 218 be merciful o lord unto thy people israel whom thou hast redeemed and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of israels charge and the blood shall be forgiven them 219 so shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the lord 2110 when thou goest forth to war against thine enemies and the lord thy god hath delivered them into thine hands and thou hast taken them captive 2111 and seest among the captives a beautiful woman and hast a desire unto her that thou wouldest have her to thy wife 2112 then thou shalt bring her home to thine house and she shall shave her head and pare her nails 2113 and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her and shall remain in thine house and bewail her father and her mother a full month and after that thou shalt go in unto her and be her husband and she shall be thy wife 2114 and it shall be if thou have no delight in her then thou shalt let her go whither she will but thou shalt not sell her at all for money thou shalt not make merchandise of her because thou hast humbled her 2115 if a man have two wives one beloved and another hated and they have born him children both the beloved and the hated and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated 2116 then it shall be when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the hated which is indeed the firstborn 2117 but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he hath for he is the beginning of his strength the right of the firstborn is his 2118 if a man have a stubborn and rebellious son which will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and that when they have chastened him will not hearken unto them 2119 then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out unto the elders of his city and unto the gate of his place 2120 and they shall say unto the elders of his city this our son is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey our voice he is a glutton and a drunkard 2121 and all the men of his city shall stone him with stones that he die so shalt thou put evil away from among you and all israel shall hear and fear 2122 and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death and he be to be put to death and thou hang him on a tree 2123 his body shall not remain all night upon the tree but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day for he that is hanged is accursed of god that thy land be not defiled which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance 221 thou shalt not see thy brothers ox or his sheep go astray and hide thyself from them thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother 222 and if thy brother be not nigh unto thee or if thou know him not then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house and it shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it and thou shalt restore it to him again 223 in like manner shalt thou do with his ass and so shalt thou do with his raiment and with all lost thing of thy brothers which he hath lost and thou hast found shalt thou do likewise thou mayest not hide thyself 224 thou shalt not see thy brothers ass or his ox fall down by the way and hide thyself from them thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again 225 the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a womans garment for all that do so are abomination unto the lord thy god 226 if a birds nest chance to be before thee in the way in any tree or on the ground whether they be young ones or eggs and the dam sitting upon the young or upon the eggs thou shalt not take the dam with the young 227 but thou shalt in any wise let the dam go and take the young to thee that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days 228 when thou buildest a new house then thou shalt make a battlement for thy roof that thou bring not blood upon thine house if any man fall from thence 229 thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds lest the fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown and the fruit of thy vineyard be defiled 2210 thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together 2211 thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts as of woollen and linen together 2212 thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy vesture wherewith thou coverest thyself 2213 if any man take a wife and go in unto her and hate her 2214 and give occasions of speech against her and bring up an evil name upon her and say i took this woman and when i came to her i found her not a maid 2215 then shall the father of the damsel and her mother take and bring forth the tokens of the damsels virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate 2216 and the damsels father shall say unto the elders i gave my daughter unto this man to wife and he hateth her 2217 and lo he hath given occasions of speech against her saying i found not thy daughter a maid and yet these are the tokens of my daughters virginity and they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city 2218 and the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him 2219 and they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver and give them unto the father of the damsel because he hath brought up an evil name upon a virgin of israel and she shall be his wife he may not put her away all his days 2220 but if this thing be true and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel 2221 then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her fathers house and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die because she hath wrought folly in israel to play the whore in her fathers house so shalt thou put evil away from among you 2222 if a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband then they shall both of them die both the man that lay with the woman and the woman so shalt thou put away evil from israel 2223 if a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband and a man find her in the city and lie with her 2224 then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city and ye shall stone them with stones that they die the damsel because she cried not being in the city and the man because he hath humbled his neighbours wife so thou shalt put away evil from among you 2225 but if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field and the man force her and lie with her then the man only that lay with her shall die 2226 but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death for as when a man riseth against his neighbour and slayeth him even so is this matter 2227 for he found her in the field and the betrothed damsel cried and there was none to save her 2228 if a man find a damsel that is a virgin which is not betrothed and lay hold on her and lie with her and they be found 2229 then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsels father fifty shekels of silver and she shall be his wife because he hath humbled her he may not put her away all his days 2230 a man shall not take his fathers wife nor discover his fathers skirt 231 he that is wounded in the stones or hath his privy member cut off shall not enter into the congregation of the lord 232 a bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the lord even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the congregation of the lord 233 an ammonite or moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the lord even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the lord for ever 234 because they met you not with bread and with water in the way when ye came forth out of egypt and because they hired against thee balaam the son of beor of pethor of mesopotamia to curse thee 235 nevertheless the lord thy god would not hearken unto balaam but the lord thy god turned the curse into a blessing unto thee because the lord thy god loved thee 236 thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever 237 thou shalt not abhor an edomite for he is thy brother thou shalt not abhor an egyptian because thou wast a stranger in his land 238 the children that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the lord in their third generation 239 when the host goeth forth against thine enemies then keep thee from every wicked thing 2310 if there be among you any man that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chanceth him by night then shall he go abroad out of the camp he shall not come within the camp 2311 but it shall be when evening cometh on he shall wash himself with water and when the sun is down he shall come into the camp again 2312 thou shalt have a place also without the camp whither thou shalt go forth abroad 2313 and thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon and it shall be when thou wilt ease thyself abroad thou shalt dig therewith and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee 2314 for the lord thy god walketh in the midst of thy camp to deliver thee and to give up thine enemies before thee therefore shall thy camp be holy that he see no unclean thing in thee and turn away from thee 2315 thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from his master unto thee 2316 he shall dwell with thee even among you in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates where it liketh him best thou shalt not oppress him 2317 there shall be no whore of the daughters of israel nor a sodomite of the sons of israel 2318 thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore or the price of a dog into the house of the lord thy god for any vow for even both these are abomination unto the lord thy god 2319 thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother usury of money usury of victuals usury of any thing that is lent upon usury 2320 unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury that the lord thy god may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the land whither thou goest to possess it 2321 when thou shalt vow a vow unto the lord thy god thou shalt not slack to pay it for the lord thy god will surely require it of thee and it would be sin in thee 2322 but if thou shalt forbear to vow it shall be no sin in thee 2323 that which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform even a freewill offering according as thou hast vowed unto the lord thy god which thou hast promised with thy mouth 2324 when thou comest into thy neighbours vineyard then thou mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel 2325 when thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour then thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbours standing corn 241 when a man hath taken a wife and married her and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes because he hath found some uncleanness in her then let him write her a bill of divorcement and give it in her hand and send her out of his house 242 and when she is departed out of his house she may go and be another mans wife 243 and if the latter husband hate her and write her a bill of divorcement and giveth it in her hand and sendeth her out of his house or if the latter husband die which took her to be his wife 244 her former husband which sent her away may not take her again to be his wife after that she is defiled for that is abomination before the lord and thou shalt not cause the land to sin which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance 245 when a man hath taken a new wife he shall not go out to war neither shall he be charged with any business but he shall be free at home one year and shall cheer up his wife which he hath taken 246 no man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge for he taketh a mans life to pledge 247 if a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of israel and maketh merchandise of him or selleth him then that thief shall die and thou shalt put evil away from among you 248 take heed in the plague of leprosy that thou observe diligently and do according to all that the priests the levites shall teach you as i commanded them so ye shall observe to do 249 remember what the lord thy god did unto miriam by the way after that ye were come forth out of egypt 2410 when thou dost lend thy brother any thing thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge 2411 thou shalt stand abroad and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee 2412 and if the man be poor thou shalt not sleep with his pledge 2413 in any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down that he may sleep in his own raiment and bless thee and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the lord thy god 2414 thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy whether he be of thy brethren or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates 2415 at his day thou shalt give him his hire neither shall the sun go down upon it for he is poor and setteth his heart upon it lest he cry against thee unto the lord and it be sin unto thee 2416 the fathers shall not be put to death for the children neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers every man shall be put to death for his own sin 2417 thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger nor of the fatherless nor take a widows raiment to pledge 2418 but thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in egypt and the lord thy god redeemed thee thence therefore i command thee to do this thing 2419 when thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field and hast forgot a sheaf in the field thou shalt not go again to fetch it it shall be for the stranger for the fatherless and for the widow that the lord thy god may bless thee in all the work of thine hands 2420 when thou beatest thine olive tree thou shalt not go over the boughs again it shall be for the stranger for the fatherless and for the widow 2421 when thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard thou shalt not glean it afterward it shall be for the stranger for the fatherless and for the widow 2422 and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of egypt therefore i command thee to do this thing 251 if there be a controversy between men and they come unto judgment that the judges may judge them then they shall justify the righteous and condemn the wicked 252 and it shall be if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten that the judge shall cause him to lie down and to be beaten before his face according to his fault by a certain number 253 forty stripes he may give him and not exceed lest if he should exceed and beat him above these with many stripes then thy brother should seem vile unto thee 254 thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn 255 if brethren dwell together and one of them die and have no child the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger her husbands brother shall go in unto her and take her to him to wife and perform the duty of an husbands brother unto her 256 and it shall be that the firstborn which she beareth shall succeed in the name of his brother which is dead that his name be not put out of israel 257 and if the man like not to take his brothers wife then let his brothers wife go up to the gate unto the elders and say my husbands brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in israel he will not perform the duty of my husbands brother 258 then the elders of his city shall call him and speak unto him and if he stand to it and say i like not to take her 259 then shall his brothers wife come unto him in the presence of the elders and loose his shoe from off his foot and spit in his face and shall answer and say so shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brothers house 2510 and his name shall be called in israel the house of him that hath his shoe loosed 2511 when men strive together one with another and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him and putteth forth her hand and taketh him by the secrets 2512 then thou shalt cut off her hand thine eye shall not pity her 2513 thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights a great and a small 2514 thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures a great and a small 2515 but thou shalt have a perfect and just weight a perfect and just measure shalt thou have that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee 2516 for all that do such things and all that do unrighteously are an abomination unto the lord thy god 2517 remember what amalek did unto thee by the way when ye were come forth out of egypt 2518 how he met thee by the way and smote the hindmost of thee even all that were feeble behind thee when thou wast faint and weary and he feared not god 2519 therefore it shall be when the lord thy god hath given thee rest from all thine enemies round about in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of amalek from under heaven thou shalt not forget it 261 and it shall be when thou art come in unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance and possessest it and dwellest therein 262 that thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth which thou shalt bring of thy land that the lord thy god giveth thee and shalt put it in a basket and shalt go unto the place which the lord thy god shall choose to place his name there 263 and thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days and say unto him i profess this day unto the lord thy god that i am come unto the country which the lord sware unto our fathers for to give us 264 and the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand and set it down before the altar of the lord thy god 265 and thou shalt speak and say before the lord thy god a syrian ready to perish was my father and he went down into egypt and sojourned there with a few and became there a nation great mighty and populous 266 and the egyptians evil entreated us and afflicted us and laid upon us hard bondage 267 and when we cried unto the lord god of our fathers the lord heard our voice and looked on our affliction and our labour and our oppression 268 and the lord brought us forth out of egypt with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with great terribleness and with signs and with wonders 269 and he hath brought us into this place and hath given us this land even a land that floweth with milk and honey 2610 and now behold i have brought the firstfruits of the land which thou o lord hast given me and thou shalt set it before the lord thy god and worship before the lord thy god 2611 and thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the lord thy god hath given unto thee and unto thine house thou and the levite and the stranger that is among you 2612 when thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine increase the third year which is the year of tithing and hast given it unto the levite the stranger the fatherless and the widow that they may eat within thy gates and be filled 2613 then thou shalt say before the lord thy god i have brought away the hallowed things out of mine house and also have given them unto the levite and unto the stranger to the fatherless and to the widow according to all thy commandments which thou hast commanded me i have not transgressed thy commandments neither have i forgotten them 2614 i have not eaten thereof in my mourning neither have i taken away ought thereof for any unclean use nor given ought thereof for the dead but i have hearkened to the voice of the lord my god and have done according to all that thou hast commanded me 2615 look down from thy holy habitation from heaven and bless thy people israel and the land which thou hast given us as thou swarest unto our fathers a land that floweth with milk and honey 2616 this day the lord thy god hath commanded thee to do these statutes and judgments thou shalt therefore keep and do them with all thine heart and with all thy soul 2617 thou hast avouched the lord this day to be thy god and to walk in his ways and to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and to hearken unto his voice 2618 and the lord hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar people as he hath promised thee and that thou shouldest keep all his commandments 2619 and to make thee high above all nations which he hath made in praise and in name and in honour and that thou mayest be an holy people unto the lord thy god as he hath spoken 271 and moses with the elders of israel commanded the people saying keep all the commandments which i command you this day 272 and it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over jordan unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee that thou shalt set thee up great stones and plaister them with plaister 273 and thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law when thou art passed over that thou mayest go in unto the land which the lord thy god giveth thee a land that floweth with milk and honey as the lord god of thy fathers hath promised thee 274 therefore it shall be when ye be gone over jordan that ye shall set up these stones which i command you this day in mount ebal and thou shalt plaister them with plaister 275 and there shalt thou build an altar unto the lord thy god an altar of stones thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon them 276 thou shalt build the altar of the lord thy god of whole stones and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the lord thy god 277 and thou shalt offer peace offerings and shalt eat there and rejoice before the lord thy god 278 and thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly 279 and moses and the priests the levites spake unto all israel saying take heed and hearken o israel this day thou art become the people of the lord thy god 2710 thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the lord thy god and do his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day 2711 and moses charged the people the same day saying 2712 these shall stand upon mount gerizim to bless the people when ye are come over jordan simeon and levi and judah and issachar and joseph and benjamin 2713 and these shall stand upon mount ebal to curse reuben gad and asher and zebulun dan and naphtali 2714 and the levites shall speak and say unto all the men of israel with a loud voice 2715 cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image an abomination unto the lord the work of the hands of the craftsman and putteth it in a secret place and all the people shall answer and say amen 2716 cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother and all the people shall say amen 2717 cursed be he that removeth his neighbours landmark and all the people shall say amen 2718 cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way and all the people shall say amen 2719 cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger fatherless and widow and all the people shall say amen 2720 cursed be he that lieth with his fathers wife because he uncovereth his fathers skirt and all the people shall say amen 2721 cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast and all the people shall say amen 2722 cursed be he that lieth with his sister the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother and all the people shall say amen 2723 cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law and all the people shall say amen 2724 cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly and all the people shall say amen 2725 cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person and all the people shall say amen 2726 cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to do them and all the people shall say amen 281 and it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all nations of the earth 282 and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god 283 blessed shalt thou be in the city and blessed shalt thou be in the field 284 blessed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy cattle the increase of thy kine and the flocks of thy sheep 285 blessed shall be thy basket and thy store 286 blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out 287 the lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face they shall come out against thee one way and flee before thee seven ways 288 the lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy storehouses and in all that thou settest thine hand unto and he shall bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee 289 the lord shall establish thee an holy people unto himself as he hath sworn unto thee if thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god and walk in his ways 2810 and all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the lord and they shall be afraid of thee 2811 and the lord shall make thee plenteous in goods in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy ground in the land which the lord sware unto thy fathers to give thee 2812 the lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season and to bless all the work of thine hand and thou shalt lend unto many nations and thou shalt not borrow 2813 and the lord shall make thee the head and not the tail and thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if that thou hearken unto the commandments of the lord thy god which i command thee this day to observe and to do them 2814 and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which i command thee this day to the right hand or to the left to go after other gods to serve them 2815 but it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee 2816 cursed shalt thou be in the city and cursed shalt thou be in the field 2817 cursed shall be thy basket and thy store 2818 cursed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land the increase of thy kine and the flocks of thy sheep 2819 cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out 2820 the lord shall send upon thee cursing vexation and rebuke in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do until thou be destroyed and until thou perish quickly because of the wickedness of thy doings whereby thou hast forsaken me 2821 the lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee until he have consumed thee from off the land whither thou goest to possess it 2822 the lord shall smite thee with a consumption and with a fever and with an inflammation and with an extreme burning and with the sword and with blasting and with mildew and they shall pursue thee until thou perish 2823 and thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass and the earth that is under thee shall be iron 2824 the lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust from heaven shall it come down upon thee until thou be destroyed 2825 the lord shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies thou shalt go out one way against them and flee seven ways before them and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth 2826 and thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air and unto the beasts of the earth and no man shall fray them away 2827 the lord will smite thee with the botch of egypt and with the emerods and with the scab and with the itch whereof thou canst not be healed 2828 the lord shall smite thee with madness and blindness and

long and there shall be no might in thine hand 2833 the fruit of thy land and all thy labours shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed alway 2834 so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see 2835 the lord shall smite thee in the knees and in the legs with a sore botch that cannot be healed from the sole of thy foot unto the top of thy head 2836 the lord shall bring thee and thy king which thou shalt set over thee unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known and there shalt thou serve other gods

but little in for the locust shall consume it 2839 thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them but shalt neither drink of the wine nor gather the grapes for the worms shall eat them 2840 thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil for thine olive shall cast his fruit 2841 thou shalt beget sons and daughters but thou shalt not enjoy them for they shall go into captivity 2842 all thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume 2843 the stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high and thou shalt come down very low 2844 he shall lend to thee and thou shalt not lend to him he shall be the head and thou shalt be the tail 2845 moreover all these curses shall come upon thee and shall pursue thee and overtake thee till thou be destroyed because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee 2846 and they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder and upon thy seed for ever 2847 because thou servedst not the lord thy god with joyfulness and with gladness of heart for the abundance of all things 2848 therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the lord shall send against thee in hunger and in thirst and in nakedness and in want of all things and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck until he have destroyed thee 2849 the lord shall bring a nation against thee from far from the end of the earth as swift as the eagle flieth a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand 2850 a nation of fierce countenance which shall not regard the person of the old nor shew favour to the young 2851 and he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle and the fruit of thy land until thou be destroyed which also shall not leave thee either corn wine or oil or the increase of thy kine or flocks of thy sheep until he have destroyed thee 2852 and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates until thy high and fenced walls come down wherein thou trustedst throughout all thy land and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land which the lord thy god hath given thee 2853 and thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters which the lord thy god hath given thee in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee 2854 so that the man that is tender among you and very delicate his eye shall be evil toward his brother and toward the wife of his bosom and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave 2855 so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat because he hath nothing left him in the siege and in the straitness wherewith thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates 2856 the tender and delicate woman among you which would not adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom and toward her son and toward her daughter 2857 and toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet and toward her children which she shall bear for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates 2858 if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book that thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful name the lord thy god 2859 then the lord will make thy plagues wonderful and the plagues of thy seed even great plagues and of long continuance and sore sicknesses and of long continuance 2860 moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of egypt which thou wast afraid of and they shall cleave unto thee 2861 also every sickness and every plague which is not written in the book of this law them will the lord bring upon thee until thou be destroyed 2862 and ye shall be left few in number whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the lord thy god 2863 and it shall come to pass that as the lord rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you so the lord will rejoice over you to destroy you and to bring you to nought and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it 2864 and the lord shall scatter thee among all people from the one end of the earth even unto the other and there thou shalt serve other gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even wood and stone 2865 and among these nations shalt thou find no ease neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest but the lord shall give thee there a trembling heart and failing of eyes and sorrow of mind 2866 and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee and thou shalt fear day and night and shalt have none assurance of thy life 2867 in the morning thou shalt say would god it were even and at even thou shalt say would god it were morning for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear and for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see 2868 and the lord shall bring thee into egypt again with ships by the way whereof i spake unto thee thou shalt see it no more again and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen and no man shall buy you 291 these are the words of the covenant which the lord commanded moses to make with the children of israel in the land of moab beside the covenant which he made with them in horeb 292 and moses called unto all israel and said unto them ye have seen all that the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt unto pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land 293 the great temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs and those great miracles 294 yet the lord hath not given you an heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day 295 and i have led you forty years in the wilderness your clothes are not waxen old upon you and thy shoe is not waxen old upon thy foot 296 ye have not eaten bread neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink that ye might know that i am the lord your god 297 and when ye came unto this place sihon the king of heshbon and og the king of bashan came out against us unto battle and we smote them 298 and we took their land and gave it for an inheritance unto the reubenites and to the gadites and to the half tribe of manasseh 299 keep therefore the words of this covenant and do them that ye may prosper in all that ye do 2910 ye stand this day all of you before the lord your god your captains of your tribes your elders and your officers with all the men of israel 2911 your little ones your wives and thy stranger that is in thy camp from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water 2912 that thou shouldest enter into covenant with the lord thy god and into his oath which the lord thy god maketh with thee this day 2913 that he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself and that he may be unto thee a god as he hath said unto thee and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob 2914 neither with you only do i make this covenant and this oath 2915 but with him that standeth here with us this day before the lord our god and also with him that is not here with us this day 2916 for ye know how we have dwelt in the land of egypt and how we came through the nations which ye passed by 2917 and ye have seen their abominations and their idols wood and stone silver and gold which were among them 2918 lest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the lord our god to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood 2919 and it come to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he bless himself in his heart saying i shall have peace though i walk in the imagination of mine heart to add drunkenness to thirst 2920 the lord will not spare him but then the anger of the lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the lord shall blot out his name from under heaven 2921 and the lord shall separate him unto evil out of all the tribes of israel according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law 2922 so that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you and the stranger that shall come from a far land shall say when they see the plagues of that land and the sicknesses which the lord hath laid upon it 2923 and that the whole land thereof is brimstone and salt and burning that it is not sown nor beareth nor any grass groweth therein like the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah admah and zeboim which the lord overthrew in his anger and in his wrath 2924 even all nations shall say wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this land what meaneth the heat of this great anger 2925 then men shall say because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord god of their fathers which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of egypt 2926 for they went and served other gods and worshipped them gods whom they knew not and whom he had not given unto them 2927 and the anger of the lord was kindled against this land to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book 2928 and the lord rooted them out of their land in anger and in wrath and in great indignation and cast them into another land as it is this day 2929 the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever that we may do all the words of this law 301 and it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee the blessing and the curse which i have set before thee and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations whither the lord thy god hath driven thee 302 and shalt return unto the lord thy god and shalt obey his voice according to all that i command thee this day thou and thy children with all thine heart and with all thy soul 303 that then the lord thy god will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all the nations whither the lord thy god hath scattered thee 304 if any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of heaven from thence will the lord thy god gather thee and from thence will he fetch thee 305 and the lord thy god will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed and thou shalt possess it and he will do thee good and multiply thee above thy fathers 306 and the lord thy god will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed to love the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest live 307 and the lord thy god will put all these curses upon thine enemies and on them that hate thee which persecuted thee 308 and thou shalt return and obey the voice of the lord and do all his commandments which i command thee this day 309 and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy land for good for the lord will again rejoice over thee for good as he rejoiced over thy fathers 3010 if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law and if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all thine heart and with all thy soul 3011 for this commandment which i command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off 3012 it is not in heaven that thou shouldest say who shall go up for us to heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it 3013 neither is it beyond the sea that thou shouldest say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it 3014 but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it 3015 see i have set before thee this day life and good and death and evil 3016 in that i command thee this day to love the lord thy god to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the lord thy god shall bless thee in the land whither thou goest to possess it 3017 but if thine heart turn away so that thou wilt not hear but shalt be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them 3018 i denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whither thou passest over jordan to go to possess it 3019 i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live 3020 that thou mayest love the lord thy god and that thou mayest obey his voice and that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the lord sware unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give them 311 and moses went and spake these words unto all israel 312 and he said unto them i am an hundred and twenty years old this day i can no more go out and come in also the lord hath said unto me thou shalt not go over this jordan 313 the lord thy god he will go over before thee and he will destroy these nations from before thee and thou shalt possess them and joshua he shall go over before thee as the lord hath said 314 and the lord shall do unto them as he did to sihon and to og kings of the amorites and unto the land of them whom he destroyed 315 and the lord shall give them up before your face that ye may do unto them according unto all the commandments which i have commanded you 316 be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the lord thy god he it is that doth go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee 317 and moses called unto joshua and said unto him in the sight of all israel be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with this people unto the land which the lord hath sworn unto their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it 318 and the lord he it is that doth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed 319 and moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the sons of levi which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord and unto all the elders of israel 3110 and moses commanded them saying at the end of every seven years in the solemnity of the year of release in the feast of tabernacles 3111 when all israel is come to appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose thou shalt read this law before all israel in their hearing 3112 gather the people together men and women and children and thy stranger that is within thy gates that they may hear and that they may learn and fear the lord your god and observe to do all the words of this law 3113 and that their children which have not known any thing may hear and learn to fear the lord your god as long as ye live in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it 3114 and the lord said unto moses behold thy days approach that thou must die call joshua and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation that i may give him a charge and moses and joshua went and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation 3115 and the lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle 3116 and the lord said unto moses behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers and this people will rise up and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land whither they go to be among them and will forsake me and break my covenant which i have made with them 3117 then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day and i will forsake them and i will hide my face from them and they shall be devoured and many evils and troubles shall befall them so that they will say in that day are not these evils come upon us because our god is not among us 3118 and i will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought in that they are turned unto other gods 3119 now therefore write ye this song for you and teach it the children of israel put it in their mouths that this song may be a witness for me against the children of israel 3120 for when i shall have brought them into the land which i sware unto their fathers that floweth with milk and honey and they shall have eaten and filled themselves and waxen fat then will they turn unto other gods and serve them and provoke me and break my covenant 3121 and it shall come to pass when many evils and troubles are befallen them that this song shall testify against them as a witness for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed for i know their imagination which they go about even now before i have brought them into the land which i sware 3122 moses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught it the children of israel 3123 and he gave joshua the son of nun a charge and said be strong and of a good courage for thou shalt bring the children of israel into the land which i sware unto them and i will be with thee 3124 and it came to pass when moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book until they were finished 3125 that moses commanded the levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord saying 3126 take this book of the law and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the lord your god that it may be there for a witness against thee 3127 for i know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck behold while i am yet alive with you this day ye have been rebellious against the lord and how much more after my death 3128 gather unto me all the elders of your tribes and your officers that i may speak these words in their ears and call heaven and earth to record against them 3129 for i know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which i have commanded you and evil will befall you in the latter days because ye will do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands 3130 and moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of israel the words of this song until they were ended 321 give ear o ye heavens and i will speak and hear o earth the words of my mouth 322 my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distil as the dew as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass 323 because i will publish the name of the lord ascribe ye greatness unto our god 324 he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways are judgment a god of truth and without iniquity just and right is he 325 they have corrupted themselves their spot is not the spot of his children they are a perverse and crooked generation 326 do ye thus requite the lord o foolish people and unwise is not he thy father that hath bought thee hath he not made thee and established thee 327 remember the days of old consider the years of many generations ask thy father and he will shew thee thy elders and they will tell thee 328 when the most high divided to the nations their inheritance when he separated the sons of adam he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of israel 329 for the lords portion is his people jacob is the lot of his inheritance 3210 he found him in a desert land and in the waste howling wilderness he led him about he instructed him he kept him as the apple of his eye 3211 as an eagle stirreth up her nest fluttereth over her young spreadeth abroad her wings taketh them beareth them on her wings 3212 so the lord alone did lead him and there was no strange god with him 3213 he made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might eat the increase of the fields and he made him to suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rock 3214 butter of kine and milk of sheep with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of bashan and goats with the fat of kidneys of wheat and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape 3215 but jeshurun waxed fat and kicked thou art waxen fat thou art grown thick thou art covered with fatness then he forsook god which made him and lightly esteemed the rock of his salvation 3216 they provoked him to jealousy with strange gods with abominations provoked they him to anger 3217 they sacrificed unto devils not to god to gods whom they knew not to new gods that came newly up whom your fathers feared not 3218 of the rock that begat thee thou art unmindful and hast forgotten god that formed thee 3219 and when the lord saw it he abhorred them because of the provoking of his sons and of his daughters 3220 and he said i will hide my face from them i will see what their end shall be for they are a very froward generation children in whom is no faith 3221 they have moved me to jealousy with that which is not god they have provoked me to anger with their vanities and i will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people i will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation 3222 for a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains 3223 i will heap mischiefs upon them i will spend mine arrows upon them 3224 they shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction i will also send the teeth of beasts upon them with the poison of serpents of the dust 3225 the sword without and terror within shall destroy both the young man and the virgin the suckling also with the man of gray hairs 3226 i said i would scatter them into corners i would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men 3227 were it not that i feared the wrath of the enemy lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely and lest they should say our hand is high and the lord hath not done all this 3228 for they are a nation void of counsel neither is there any understanding in them 3229 o that they were wise that they understood this that they would consider their latter end 3230 how should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had sold them and the lord had shut them up 3231 for their rock is not as our rock even our enemies themselves being judges 3232 for their vine is of the vine of sodom and of the fields of gomorrah their grapes are grapes of gall their clusters are bitter 3233 their wine is the poison of dragons and the cruel venom of asps 3234 is not this laid up in store with me and sealed up among my treasures 3235 to me belongeth vengeance and recompence their foot shall slide in due time for the day of their calamity is at hand and the things that shall come upon them make haste 3236 for the lord shall judge his people and repent himself for his servants when he seeth that their power is gone and there is none shut up or left 3237 and he shall say where are their gods their rock in whom they trusted 3238 which did eat the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings let them rise up and help you and be your protection 3239 see now that i even i am he and there is no god with me i kill and i make alive i wound and i heal neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand 3240 for i lift up my hand to heaven and say i live for ever 3241 if i whet my glittering sword and mine hand take hold on judgment i will render vengeance to mine enemies and will reward them that hate me 3242 i will make mine arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall devour flesh and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy 3243 rejoice o ye nations with his people for he will avenge the blood of his servants and will render vengeance to his adversaries and will be merciful unto his land and to his people 3244 and moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people he and hoshea the son of nun 3245 and moses made an end of speaking all these words to all israel 3246 and he said unto them set your hearts unto all the words which i testify among you this day which ye shall command your children to observe to do all the words of this law 3247 for it is not a vain thing for you because it is your life and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land whither ye go over jordan to possess it 3248 and the lord spake unto moses that selfsame day saying 3249 get thee up into this mountain abarim unto mount nebo which is in the land of moab that is over against jericho and behold the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel for a possession 3250 and die in the mount whither thou goest up and be gathered unto thy people as aaron thy brother died in mount hor and was gathered unto his people 3251 because ye trespassed against me among the children of israel at the waters of meribahkadesh in the wilderness of zin because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of israel 3252 yet thou shalt see the land before thee but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which i give the children of israel 331 and this is the blessing wherewith moses the man of god blessed the children of israel before his death 332 and he said the lord came from sinai and rose up from seir unto them he shined forth from mount paran and he came with ten thousands of saints from his right hand went a fiery law for them 333 yea he loved the people all his saints are in thy hand and they sat down at thy feet every one shall receive of thy words 334 moses commanded us a law even the inheritance of the congregation of jacob 335 and he was king in jeshurun when the heads of the people and the tribes of israel were gathered together 336 let reuben live and not die and let not his men be few 337 and this is the blessing of judah and he said hear lord the voice of judah and bring him unto his people let his hands be sufficient for him and be thou an help to him from his enemies 338 and of levi he said let thy thummim and thy urim be with thy holy one whom thou didst prove at massah and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of meribah 339 who said unto his father and to his mother i have not seen him neither did he acknowledge his brethren nor knew his own children for they have observed thy word and kept thy covenant 3310 they shall teach jacob thy judgments and israel thy law they shall put incense before thee and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar 3311 bless lord his substance and accept the work of his hands smite through the loins of them that rise against him and of them that hate him that they rise not again 3312 and of benjamin he said the beloved of the lord shall dwell in safety by him and the lord shall cover him all the day long and he shall dwell between his shoulders 3313 and of joseph he said blessed of the lord be his land for the precious things of heaven for the dew and for the deep that coucheth beneath 3314 and for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun and for the precious things put forth by the moon 3315 and for the chief things of the ancient mountains and for the precious things of the lasting hills 3316 and for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush let the blessing come upon the head of joseph and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren 3317 his glory is like the firstling of his bullock and his horns are like the horns of unicorns with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth and they are the ten thousands of ephraim and they are the thousands of manasseh 3318 and of zebulun he said rejoice zebulun in thy going out and issachar in thy tents 3319 they shall call the people unto the mountain there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of treasures hid in the sand 3320 and of gad he said blessed be he that enlargeth gad he dwelleth as a lion and teareth the arm with the crown of the head 3321 and he provided the first part for himself because there in a portion of the lawgiver was he seated and he came with the heads of the people he executed the justice of the lord and his judgments with israel 3322 and of dan he said dan is a lions whelp he shall leap from bashan 3323 and of naphtali he said o naphtali satisfied with favour and full with the blessing of the lord possess thou the west and the south 3324 and of asher he said let asher be blessed with children let him be acceptable to his brethren and let him dip his foot in oil 3325 thy shoes shall be iron and brass and as thy days so shall thy strength be 3326 there is none like unto the god of jeshurun who rideth upon the heaven in thy help and in his excellency on the sky 3327 the eternal god is thy refuge and underneath are the everlasting arms and he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee and shall say destroy them 3328 israel then shall dwell in safety alone the fountain of jacob shall be upon a land of corn and wine also his heavens shall drop down dew 3329 happy art thou o israel who is like unto thee o people saved by the lord the shield of thy help and who is the sword of thy excellency and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee and thou shalt tread upon their high places 341 and moses went up from the plains of moab unto the mountain of nebo to the top of pisgah that is over against jericho and the lord shewed him all the land of gilead unto dan 342 and all naphtali and the land of ephraim and manasseh and all the land of judah unto the utmost sea 343 and the south and the plain of the valley of jericho the city of palm trees unto zoar 344 and the lord said unto him this is the land which i sware unto abraham unto isaac and unto jacob saying i will give it unto thy seed i have caused thee to see it with thine eyes but thou shalt not go over thither 345 so moses the servant of the lord died there in the land of moab according to the word of the lord 346 and he buried him in a valley in the land of moab over against bethpeor but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day 347 and moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died his eye was not dim nor his natural force abated 348 and the children of israel wept for moses in the plains of moab thirty days so the days of weeping and mourning for moses were ended 349 and joshua the son of nun was full of the spirit of wisdom for moses had laid his hands upon him and the children of israel hearkened unto him and did as the lord commanded moses 3410 and there arose not a prophet since in israel like unto moses whom the lord knew face to face 3411 in all the signs and the wonders which the lord sent him to do in the land of egypt to pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land 3412 and in all that mighty hand and in all the great terror which moses shewed in the sight of all israel the book of joshua 11 now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses minister saying 12 moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all this people unto the land which i do give to them even to the children of israel 13 every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses 14 from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast 15 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee 16 be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i sware unto their fathers to give them 17 only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest 18 this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success 19 have not i commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee whithersoever thou goest 110 then joshua commanded the officers of the people saying 111 pass through the host and command the people saying prepare you victuals for within three days ye shall pass over this jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you to possess it 112 and to the reubenites and to the gadites and to half the tribe of manasseh spake joshua saying 113 remember the word which moses the servant of the lord commanded you saying the lord your god hath given you rest and hath given you this land 114 your wives your little ones and your cattle shall remain in the land which moses gave you on this side jordan but ye shall pass before your brethren armed all the mighty men of valour and help them 115 until the lord have given your brethren rest as he hath given you and they also have possessed the land which the lord your god giveth them then ye shall return unto the land of your possession and enjoy it which moses the lords servant gave you on this side jordan toward the sunrising 116 and they answered joshua saying all that thou commandest us we will do and whithersoever thou sendest us we will go 117 according as we hearkened unto moses in all things so will we hearken unto thee only the lord thy god be with thee as he was with moses 118 whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him he shall be put to death only be strong and of a good courage 21 and joshua the son of nun sent out of shittim two men to spy secretly saying go view the land even jericho and they went and came into an harlots house named rahab and lodged there 22 and it was told the king of jericho saying behold there came men in hither to night of the children of israel to search out the country 23 and the king of jericho sent unto rahab saying bring forth the men that are come to thee which are entered into thine house for they be come to search out all the country 24 and the woman took the two men and hid them and said thus there came men unto me but i wist not whence they were 25 and it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate when it was dark that the men went out whither the men went i wot not pursue after them quickly for ye shall overtake them 26 but she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order upon the roof 27 and the men pursued after them the way to jordan unto the fords and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out they shut the gate 28 and before they were laid down she came up unto them upon the roof 29 and she said unto the men i know that the lord hath given you the land and that your terror is fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you 210 for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when ye came out of egypt and what ye did unto the two kings of the amorites that were on the other side jordan sihon and og whom ye utterly destroyed 211 and as soon as we had heard these things our hearts did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in heaven above and in earth beneath 212 now therefore i pray you swear unto me by the lord since i have shewed you kindness that ye will also shew kindness unto my fathers house and give me a true token 213 and that ye will save alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death 214 and the men answered her our life for yours if ye utter not this our business and it shall be when the lord hath given us the land that we will deal kindly and truly with thee 215 then she let them down by a cord through the window for her house was upon the town wall and she dwelt upon the wall 216 and she said unto them get you to the mountain lest the pursuers meet you and hide yourselves there three days until the pursuers be returned and afterward may ye go your way 217 and the men said unto her we will be blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear 218 behold when we come into the land thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by and thou shalt bring thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy fathers household home unto thee 219 and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless and whosoever shall be with thee in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him 220 and if thou utter this our business then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear 221 and she said according unto your words so be it and she sent them away and they departed and she bound the scarlet line in the window 222 and they went and came unto the mountain and abode there three days until the pursuers were returned and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way but found them not 223 so the two men returned and descended from the mountain and passed over and came to joshua the son of nun and told him all things that befell them 224 and they said unto joshua truly the lord hath delivered into our hands all the land for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us 31 and joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from shittim and came to jordan he and all the children of israel and lodged there before they passed over 32 and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host 33 and they commanded the people saying when ye see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priests the levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it 34 yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way by which ye must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore 35 and joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for to morrow the lord will do wonders among you 36 and joshua spake unto the priests saying take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people and they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people 37 and the lord said unto joshua this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel that they may know that as i was with moses so i will be with thee 38 and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of jordan ye shall stand still in jordan 39 and joshua said unto the children of israel come hither and hear the words of the lord your god 310 and joshua said hereby ye shall know that the living god is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites and the hittites and the hivites and the perizzites and the girgashites and the amorites and the jebusites 311 behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passeth over before you into jordan 312 now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of israel out of every tribe a man 313 and it shall come to pass as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand upon an heap 314 and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people 315 and as they that bare the ark were come unto jordan and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest 316 that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon an heap very far from the city adam that is beside zaretan and those that came down toward the sea of the plain even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed over right against jericho 317 and the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of jordan and all the israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over jordan 41 and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over jordan that the lord spake unto joshua saying 42 take you twelve men out of the people out of every tribe a man 43 and command ye them saying take you hence out of the midst of jordan out of the place where the priests feet stood firm twelve stones and ye shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where ye shall lodge this night 44 then joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the children of israel out of every tribe a man 45 and joshua said unto them pass over before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according unto the number of the tribes of the children of israel 46 that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones 47 then ye shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it passed over jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of israel for ever 48 and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of jordan as the lord spake unto joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged and laid them down there 49 and joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of jordan in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood and they are there unto this day 410 for the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of jordan until everything was finished that the lord commanded joshua to speak unto the people according to all that moses commanded joshua and the people hasted and passed over 411 and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over that the ark of the lord passed over and the priests in the presence of the people 412 and the children of reuben and the children of gad and half the tribe of manasseh passed over armed before the children of israel as moses spake unto them 413 about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the lord unto battle to the plains of jericho 414 on that day the lord magnified joshua in the sight of all israel and they feared him as they feared moses all the days of his life 415 and the lord spake unto joshua saying 416 command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony that they come up out of jordan 417 joshua therefore commanded the priests saying come ye up out of jordan 418 and it came to pass when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord were come up out of the midst of jordan and the soles of the priests feet were lifted up unto the dry land that the waters of jordan returned unto their place and flowed over all his banks as they did before 419 and the people came up out of jordan on the tenth day of the first month and encamped in gilgal in the east border of jericho 420 and those twelve stones which they took out of jordan did joshua pitch in gilgal 421 and he spake unto the children of israel saying when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean these stones 422 then ye shall let your children know saying israel came over this jordan on dry land 423 for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you until ye were passed over as the lord your god did to the red sea which he dried up from before us until we were gone over 424 that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord that it is mighty that ye might fear the lord your god for ever 51 and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which were on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of the canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up the waters of jordan from before the children of israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was there spirit in them any more because of the children of israel 52 at that time the lord said unto joshua make thee sharp knives and circumcise again the children of israel the second time 53 and joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskins 54 and this is the cause why joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of egypt 55 now all the people that came out were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of egypt them they had not circumcised 56 for the children of israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the people that were men of war which came out of egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the lord unto whom the lord sware that he would not shew them the land which the lord sware unto their fathers that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honey 57 and their children whom he raised up in their stead them joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way 58 and it came to pass when they had done circumcising all the people that they abode in their places in the camp till they were whole 59 and the lord said unto joshua this day have i rolled away the reproach of egypt from off you wherefore the name of the place is called gilgal unto this day 510 and the children of israel encamped in gilgal and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of jericho 511 and they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover unleavened cakes and parched corn in the selfsame day 512 and the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land neither had the children of israel manna any more but they did eat of the fruit of the land of canaan that year 513 and it came to pass when joshua was by jericho that he lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand and joshua went unto him and said unto him art thou for us or for our adversaries 514 and he said nay but as captain of the host of the lord am i now come and joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my lord unto his servant 515 and the captain of the lords host said unto joshua loose thy shoe from off thy foot for the place whereon thou standest is holy and joshua did so 61 now jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of israel none went out and none came in 62 and the lord said unto joshua see i have given into thine hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valour 63 and ye shall compass the city all ye men of war and go round about the city once thus shalt thou do six days 64 and seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times and the priests shall blow with the trumpets 65 and it shall come to pass that when they make a long blast with the rams horn and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him 66 and joshua the son of nun called the priests and said unto them take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the lord 67 and he said unto the people pass on and compass the city and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the lord 68 and it came to pass when joshua had spoken unto the people that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams horns passed on before the lord and blew with the trumpets and the ark of the covenant of the lord followed them 69 and the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets and the rereward came after the ark the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets 610 and joshua had commanded the people saying ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day i bid you shout then shall ye shout 611 so the ark of the lord compassed the city going about it once and they came into the camp and lodged in the camp 612 and joshua rose early in the morning and the priests took up the ark of the lord 613 and seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams horns before the ark of the lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets and the armed men went before them but the rereward came after the ark of the lord the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets 614 and the second day they compassed the city once and returned into the camp so they did six days 615 and it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same manner seven times only on that day they compassed the city seven times 616 and it came to pass at the seventh time when the priests blew with the trumpets joshua said unto the people shout for the lord hath given you the city 617 and the city shall be accursed even it and all that are therein to the lord only rahab the harlot shall live she and all that are with her in the house because she hid the messengers that we sent 618 and ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing lest ye make yourselves accursed when ye take of the accursed thing and make the camp of israel a curse and trouble it 619 but all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the lord they shall come into the treasury of the lord 620 so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city 621 and they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and woman young and old and ox and sheep and ass with the edge of the sword 622 but joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country go into the harlots house and bring out thence the woman and all that she hath as ye sware unto her 623 and the young men that were spies went in and brought out rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she had and they brought out all her kindred and left them without the camp of israel 624 and they burnt the city with fire and all that was therein only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron they put into the treasury of the house of the lord 625 and joshua saved rahab the harlot alive and her fathers household and all that she had and she dwelleth in israel even unto this day because she hid the messengers which joshua sent to spy out jericho 626 and joshua adjured them at that time saying cursed be the man before the lord that riseth up and buildeth this city jericho he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it 627 so the lord was with joshua and his fame was noised throughout all the country 71 but the children of israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing for achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah took of the accursed thing and the anger of the lord was kindled against the children of israel 72 and joshua sent men from jericho to ai which is beside bethaven on the east of bethel and spake unto them saying go up and view the country and the men went up and viewed ai 73 and they returned to joshua and said unto him let not all the people go up but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite ai and make not all the people to labour thither for they are but few 74 so there went up thither of the people about three thousand men and they fled before the men of ai 75 and the men of ai smote of them about thirty and six men for they chased them from before the gate even unto shebarim and smote them in the going down wherefore the hearts of the people melted and became as water 76 and joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the lord until the eventide he and the elders of israel and put dust upon their heads 77 and joshua said alas o lord god wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over jordan to deliver us into the hand of the amorites to destroy us would to god we had been content and dwelt on the other side jordan 78 o lord what shall i say when israel turneth their backs before their enemies 79 for the canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall environ us round and cut off our name from the earth and what wilt thou do unto thy great name 710 and the lord said unto joshua get thee up wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face 711 israel hath sinned and they have also transgressed my covenant which i commanded them for they have even taken of the accursed thing and have also stolen and dissembled also and they have put it even among their own stuff 712 therefore the children of israel could not stand before their enemies but turned their backs before their enemies because they were accursed neither will i be with you any more except ye destroy the accursed from among you 713 up sanctify the people and say sanctify yourselves against to morrow for thus saith the lord god of israel there is an accursed thing in the midst of thee o israel thou canst not stand before thine enemies until ye take away the accursed thing from among you 714 in the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes and it shall be that the tribe which the lord taketh shall come according to the families thereof and the family which the lord shall take shall come by households and the household which the lord shall take shall come man by man 715 and it shall be that he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire he and all that he hath because he hath transgressed the covenant of the lord and because he hath wrought folly in israel 716 so joshua rose up early in the morning and brought israel by their tribes and the tribe of judah was taken 717 and he brought the family of judah and he took the family of the zarhites and he brought the family of the zarhites man by man and zabdi was taken 718 and he brought his household man by man and achan the son of carmi the son of zabdi the son of zerah of the tribe of judah was taken 719 and joshua said unto achan my son give i pray thee glory to the lord god of israel and make confession unto him and tell me now what thou hast done hide it not from me 720 and achan answered joshua and said indeed i have sinned against the lord god of israel and thus and thus have i done 721 when i saw among the spoils a goodly babylonish garment and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight then i coveted them and took them and behold they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent and the silver under it 722 so joshua sent messengers and they ran unto the tent and behold it was hid in his tent and the silver under it 723 and they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them unto joshua and unto all the children of israel and laid them out before the lord 724 and joshua and all israel with him took achan the son of zerah and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had and they brought them unto the valley of achor 725 and joshua said why hast thou troubled us the lord shall trouble thee this day and all israel stoned him with stones and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones 726 and they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day so the lord turned from the fierceness of his anger wherefore the name of that place was called the valley of achor unto this day 81 and the lord said unto joshua fear not neither be thou dismayed take all the people of war with thee and arise go up to ai see i have given into thy hand the king of ai and his people and his city and his land 82 and thou shalt do to ai and her king as thou didst unto jericho and her king only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves lay thee an ambush for the city behind it 83 so joshua arose and all the people of war to go up against ai and joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour and sent them away by night 84 and he commanded them saying behold ye shall lie in wait against the city even behind the city go not very far from the city but be ye all ready 85 and i and all the people that are with me will approach unto the city and it shall come to pass when they come out against us as at the first that we will flee before them 86 for they will come out after us till we have drawn them from the city for they will say they flee before us as at the first therefore we will flee before them 87 then ye shall rise up from the ambush and seize upon the city for the lord your god will deliver it into your hand 88 and it shall be when ye have taken the city that ye shall set the city on fire according to the commandment of the lord shall ye do see i have commanded you 89 joshua therefore sent them forth and they went to lie in ambush and abode between bethel and ai on the west side of ai but joshua lodged that night among the people 810 and joshua rose up early in the morning and numbered the people and went up he and the elders of israel before the people to ai 811 and all the people even the people of war that were with him went up and drew nigh and came before the city and pitched on the north side of ai now there was a valley between them and ai 812 and he took about five thousand men and set them to lie in ambush between bethel and ai on the west side of the city 813 and when they had set the people even all the host that was on the north of the city and their liers in wait on the west of the city joshua went that night into the midst of the valley 814 and it came to pass when the king of ai saw it that they hasted and rose up early and the men of the city went out against israel to battle he and all his people at a time appointed before the plain but he wist not that there were liers in ambush against him behind the city 815 and joshua and all israel made as if they were beaten before them and fled by the way of the wilderness 816 and all the people that were in ai were called together to pursue after them and they pursued after joshua and were drawn away from the city 817 and there was not a man left in ai or bethel that went not out after israel and they left the city open and pursued after israel 818 and the lord said unto joshua stretch out the spear that is in thy hand toward ai for i will give it into thine hand and joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward the city 819 and the ambush arose quickly out of their place and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand and they entered into the city and took it and hasted and set the city on fire 820 and when the men of ai looked behind them they saw and behold the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven and they had no power to flee this way or that way and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers 821 and when joshua and all israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended then they turned again and slew the men of ai 822 and the other issued out of the city against them so they were in the midst of israel some on this side and some on that side and they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape 823 and the king of ai they took alive and brought him to joshua 824 and it came to pass when israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of ai in the field in the wilderness wherein they chased them and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword until they were consumed that all the israelites returned unto ai and smote it with the edge of the sword 825 and so it was that all that fell that day both of men and women were twelve thousand even all the men of ai 826 for joshua drew not his hand back wherewith he stretched out the spear until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of ai 827 only the cattle and the spoil of that city israel took for a prey unto themselves according unto the word of the lord which he commanded joshua 828 and joshua burnt ai and made it an heap for ever even a desolation unto this day 829 and the king of ai he hanged on a tree until eventide and as soon as the sun was down joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city and raise thereon a great heap of stones that remaineth unto this day 830 then joshua built an altar unto the lord god of israel in mount ebal 831 as moses the servant of the lord commanded the children of israel as it is written in the book of the law of moses an altar of whole stones over which no man hath lift up any iron and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the lord and sacrificed peace offerings 832 and he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of moses which he wrote in the presence of the children of israel 833 and all israel and their elders and officers and their judges stood on this side the ark and on that side before the priests the levites which bare the ark of the covenant of the lord as well the stranger as he that was born among them half of them over against mount gerizim and half of them over against mount ebal as moses the servant of the lord had commanded before that they should bless the people of israel 834 and afterward he read all the words of the law the blessings and cursings according to all that is written in the book of the law 835 there was not a word of all that moses commanded which joshua read not before all the congregation of israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers that were conversant among them 91 and it came to pass when all the kings which were on this side jordan in the hills and in the valleys and in all the coasts of the great sea over against lebanon the hittite and the amorite the canaanite the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite heard thereof 92 that they gathered themselves together to fight with joshua and with israel with one accord 93 and when the inhabitants of gibeon heard what joshua had done unto jericho and to ai 94 they did work wilily and went and made as if they had been ambassadors and took old sacks upon their asses and wine bottles old and rent and bound up 95 and old shoes and clouted upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy 96 and they went to joshua unto the camp at gilgal and said unto him and to the men of israel we be come from a far country now therefore make ye a league with us 97 and the men of israel said unto the hivites peradventure ye dwell among us and how shall we make a league with you 98 and they said unto joshua we are thy servants and joshua said unto them who are ye and from whence come ye 99 and they said unto him from a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the lord thy god for we have heard the fame of him and all that he did in egypt 910 and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites that were beyond jordan to sihon king of heshbon and to og king of bashan which was at ashtaroth 911 wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us saying take victuals with you for the journey and go to meet them and say unto them we are your servants therefore now make ye a league with us 912 this our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you but now behold it is dry and it is mouldy 913 and these bottles of wine which we filled were new and behold they be rent and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey 914 and the men took of their victuals and asked not counsel at the mouth of the lord 915 and joshua made peace with them and made a league with them to let them live and the princes of the congregation sware unto them 916 and it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them that they heard that they were their neighbours and that they dwelt among them 917 and the children of israel journeyed and came unto their cities on the third day now their cities were gibeon and chephirah and beeroth and kirjathjearim 918 and the children of israel smote them not because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the lord god of israel and all the congregation murmured against the princes 919 but all the princes said unto all the congregation we have sworn unto them by the lord god of israel now therefore we may not touch them 920 this we will do to them we will even let them live lest wrath be upon us because of the oath which we sware unto them 921 and the princes said unto them let them live but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation as the princes had promised them 922 and joshua called for them and he spake unto them saying wherefore have ye beguiled us saying we are very far from you when ye dwell among us 923 now therefore ye are cursed and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my god 924 and they answered joshua and said because it was certainly told thy servants how that the lord thy god commanded his servant moses to give you all the land and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you and have done this thing 925 and now behold we are in thine hand as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us do 926 and so did he unto them and delivered them out of the hand of the children of israel that they slew them not 927 and joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the lord even unto this day in the place which he should choose 101 now it came to pass when adonizedec king of jerusalem had heard how joshua had taken ai and had utterly destroyed it as he had done to jericho and her king so he had done to ai and her king and how the inhabitants of gibeon had made peace with israel and were among them 102 that they feared greatly because gibeon was a great city as one of the royal cities and because it was greater than ai and all the men thereof were mighty 103 wherefore adonizedec king of jerusalem sent unto hoham king of hebron and unto piram king of jarmuth and unto japhia king of lachish and unto debir king of eglon saying 104 come up unto me and help me that we may smite gibeon for it hath made peace with joshua and with the children of israel 105 therefore the five kings of the amorites the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish the king of eglon gathered themselves together and went up they and all their hosts and encamped before gibeon and made war against it 106 and the men of gibeon sent unto joshua to the camp to gilgal saying slack not thy hand from thy servants come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us 107 so joshua ascended from gilgal he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valour 108 and the lord said unto joshua fear them not for i have delivered them into thine hand there shall not a man of them stand before thee 109 joshua therefore came unto them suddenly and went up from gilgal all night 1010 and the lord discomfited them before israel and slew them with a great slaughter at gibeon and chased them along the way that goeth up to bethhoron and smote them to azekah and unto makkedah 1011 and it came to pass as they fled from before israel and were in the going down to bethhoron that the lord cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto azekah and they died they were more which died with hailstones than they whom the children of israel slew with the sword 1012 then spake joshua to the lord in the day when the lord delivered up the amorites before the children of israel and he said in the sight of israel sun stand thou still upon gibeon and thou moon in the valley of ajalon 1013 and the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of jasher so the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day 1014 and there was no day like that before it or after it that the lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the lord fought for israel 1015 and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp to gilgal 1016 but these five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at makkedah 1017 and it was told joshua saying the five kings are found hid in a cave at makkedah 1018 and joshua said roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave and set men by it for to keep them 1019 and stay ye not but pursue after your enemies and smite the hindmost of them suffer them not to enter into their cities for the lord your god hath delivered them into your hand 1020 and it came to pass when joshua and the children of israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter till they were consumed that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced cities 1021 and all the people returned to the camp to joshua at makkedah in peace none moved his tongue against any of the children of israel 1022 then said joshua open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave 1023 and they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave the king of jerusalem the king of hebron the king of jarmuth the king of lachish and the king of eglon 1024 and it came to pass when they brought out those kings unto joshua that joshua called for all the men of israel and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him come near put your feet upon the necks of these kings and they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them 1025 and joshua said unto them fear not nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus shall the lord do to all your enemies against whom ye fight 1026 and afterward joshua smote them and slew them and hanged them on five trees and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening 1027 and it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun that joshua commanded and they took them down off the trees and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid and laid great stones in the caves mouth which remain until this very day 1028 and that day joshua took makkedah and smote it with the edge of the sword and the king thereof he utterly destroyed them and all the souls that were therein he let none remain and he did to the king of makkedah as he did unto the king of jericho 1029 then joshua passed from makkedah and all israel with him unto libnah and fought against libnah 1030 and the lord delivered it also and the king thereof into the hand of israel and he smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he let none remain in it but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of jericho 1031 and joshua passed from libnah and all israel with him unto lachish and encamped against it and fought against it 1032 and the lord delivered lachish into the hand of israel which took it on the second day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein according to all that he had done to libnah 1033 then horam king of gezer came up to help lachish and joshua smote him and his people until he had left him none remaining 1034 and from lachish joshua passed unto eglon and all israel with him and they encamped against it and fought against it 1035 and they took it on that day and smote it with the edge of the sword and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that day according to all that he had done to lachish 1036 and joshua went up from eglon and all israel with him unto hebron and they fought against it 1037 and they took it and smote it with the edge of the sword and the king thereof and all the cities thereof and all the souls that were therein he left none remaining according to all that he had done to eglon but destroyed it utterly and all the souls that were therein 1038 and joshua returned and all israel with him to debir and fought against it 1039 and he took it and the king thereof and all the cities thereof and they smote them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein he left none remaining as he had done to hebron so he did to debir and to the king thereof as he had done also to libnah and to her king 1040 so joshua smote all the country of the hills and of the south and of the vale and of the springs and all their kings he left none remaining but utterly destroyed all that breathed as the lord god of israel commanded 1041 and joshua smote them from kadeshbarnea even unto gaza and all the country of goshen even unto gibeon 1042 and all these kings and their land did joshua take at one time because the lord god of israel fought for israel 1043 and joshua returned and all israel with him unto the camp to gilgal 111 and it came to pass when jabin king of hazor had heard those things that he sent to jobab king of madon and to the king of shimron and to the king of achshaph 112 and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains and of the plains south of chinneroth and in the valley and in the borders of dor on the west 113 and to the canaanite on the east and on the west and to the amorite and the hittite and the perizzite and the jebusite in the mountains and to the hivite under hermon in the land of mizpeh 114 and they went out they and all their hosts with them much people even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude with horses and chariots very many 115 and when all these kings were met together they came and pitched together at the waters of merom to fight against israel 116 and the lord said unto joshua be not afraid because of them for to morrow about this time will i deliver them up all slain before israel thou shalt hough their horses and burn their chariots with fire 117 so joshua came and all the people of war with him against them by the waters of merom suddenly and they fell upon them 118 and the lord delivered them into the hand of israel who smote them and chased them unto great zidon and unto misrephothmaim and unto the valley of mizpeh eastward and they smote them until they left them none remaining 119 and joshua did unto them as the lord bade him he houghed their horses and burnt their chariots with fire 1110 and joshua at that time turned back and took hazor and smote the king thereof with the sword for hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms 1111 and they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword utterly destroying them there was not any left to breathe and he burnt hazor with fire 1112 and all the cities of those kings and all the kings of them did joshua take and smote them with the edge of the sword and he utterly destroyed them as moses the servant of the lord commanded 1113 but as for the cities that stood still in their strength israel burned none of them save hazor only that did joshua burn 1114 and all the spoil of these cities and the cattle the children of israel took for a prey unto themselves but every man they smote with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them neither left they any to breathe 1115 as the lord commanded moses his servant so did moses command joshua and so did joshua he left nothing undone of all that the lord commanded moses 1116 so joshua took all that land the hills and all the south country and all the land of goshen and the valley and the plain and the mountain of israel and the valley of the same 1117 even from the mount halak that goeth up to seir even unto baalgad in the valley of lebanon under mount hermon and all their kings he took and smote them and slew them 1118 joshua made war a long time with all those kings 1119 there was not a city that made peace with the children of israel save the hivites the inhabitants of gibeon all other they took in battle 1120 for it was of the lord to harden their hearts that they should come against israel in battle that he might destroy them utterly and that they might have no favour but that he might destroy them as the lord commanded moses 1121 and at that time came joshua and cut off the anakims from the mountains from hebron from debir from anab and from all the mountains of judah and from all the mountains of israel joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities 1122 there was none of the anakims left in the land of the children of israel only in gaza in gath and in ashdod there remained 1123 so joshua took the whole land according to all that the lord said unto moses and joshua gave it for an inheritance unto israel according to their divisions by their tribes and the land rested from war 121 now these are the kings of the land which the children of israel smote and possessed their land on the other side jordan toward the rising of the sun from the river arnon unto mount hermon and all the plain on the east 122 sihon king of the amorites who dwelt in heshbon and ruled from aroer which is upon the bank of the river arnon and from the middle of the river and from half gilead even unto the river jabbok which is the border of the children of ammon 123 and from the plain to the sea of chinneroth on the east and unto the sea of the plain even the salt sea on the east the way to bethjeshimoth and from the south under ashdothpisgah 124 and the coast of og king of bashan which was of the remnant of the giants that dwelt at ashtaroth and at edrei 125 and reigned in mount hermon and in salcah and in all bashan unto the border of the geshurites and the maachathites and half gilead the border of sihon king of heshbon 126 them did moses the servant of the lord and the children of israel smite and moses the servant of the lord gave it for a possession unto the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh 127 and these are the kings of the country which joshua and the children of israel smote on this side jordan on the west from baalgad in the valley of lebanon even unto the mount halak that goeth up to seir which joshua gave unto the tribes of israel for a possession according to their divisions 128 in the mountains and in the valleys and in the plains and in the springs and in the wilderness and in the south country the hittites the amorites and the canaanites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites 129 the king of jericho one the king of ai which is beside bethel one 1210 the king of jerusalem one the king of hebron one 1211 the king of jarmuth one the king of lachish one 1212 the king of eglon one the king of gezer one 1213 the king of debir one the king of geder one 1214 the king of hormah one the king of arad one 1215 the king of libnah one the king of adullam one 1216 the king of makkedah one the king of bethel one 1217 the king of tappuah one the king of hepher one 1218 the king of aphek one the king of lasharon one 1219 the king of madon one the king of hazor one 1220 the king of shimronmeron one the king of achshaph one 1221 the king of taanach one the king of megiddo one 1222 the king of kedesh one the king of jokneam of carmel one 1223 the king of dor in the coast of dor one the king of the nations of gilgal one 1224 the king of tirzah one all the kings thirty and one 131 now joshua was old and stricken in years and the lord said unto him thou art old and stricken in years and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed 132 this is the land that yet remaineth all the borders of the philistines and all geshuri 133 from sihor which is before egypt even unto the borders of ekron northward which is counted to the canaanite five lords of the philistines the gazathites and the ashdothites the eshkalonites the gittites and the ekronites also the avites 134 from the south all the land of the canaanites and mearah that is beside the sidonians unto aphek to the borders of the amorites 135 and the land of the giblites and all lebanon toward the sunrising from baalgad under mount hermon unto the entering into hamath 136 all the inhabitants of the hill country from lebanon unto misrephothmaim and all the sidonians them will i drive out from before the children of israel only divide thou it by lot unto the israelites for an inheritance as i have commanded thee 137 now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes and the half tribe of manasseh 138 with whom the reubenites and the gadites have received their inheritance which moses gave them beyond jordan eastward even as moses the servant of the lord gave them 139 from aroer that is upon the bank of the river arnon and the city that is in the midst of the river and all the plain of medeba unto dibon 1310 and all the cities of sihon king of the amorites which reigned in heshbon unto the border of the children of ammon 1311 and gilead and the border of the geshurites and maachathites and all mount hermon and all bashan unto salcah 1312 all the kingdom of og in bashan which reigned in ashtaroth and in edrei who remained of the remnant of the giants for these did moses smite and cast them out 1313 nevertheless the children of israel expelled not the geshurites nor the maachathites but the geshurites and the maachathites dwell among the israelites until this day 1314 only unto the tribes of levi he gave none inheritance the sacrifices of the lord god of israel made by fire are their inheritance as he said unto them 1315 and moses gave unto the tribe of the children of reuben inheritance according to their families 1316 and their coast was from aroer that is on the bank of the river arnon and the city that is in the midst of the river and all the plain by medeba 1317 heshbon and all her cities that are in the plain dibon and bamothbaal and bethbaalmeon 1318 and jahaza and kedemoth and mephaath 1319 and kirjathaim and sibmah and zarethshahar in the mount of the valley 1320 and bethpeor and ashdothpisgah and bethjeshimoth 1321 and all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites which reigned in heshbon whom moses smote with the princes of midian evi and rekem and zur and hur and reba which were dukes of sihon dwelling in the country 1322 balaam also the son of beor the soothsayer did the children of israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by them 1323 and the border of the children of reuben was jordan and the border thereof this was the inheritance of the children of reuben after their families the cities and the villages thereof 1324 and moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of gad even unto the children of gad according to their families 1325 and their coast was jazer and all the cities of gilead and half the land of the children of ammon unto aroer that is before rabbah 1326 and from heshbon unto ramathmizpeh and betonim and from mahanaim unto the border of debir 1327 and in the valley betharam and bethnimrah and succoth and zaphon the rest of the kingdom of sihon king of heshbon jordan and his border even unto the edge of the sea of chinnereth on the other side jordan eastward 1328 this is the inheritance of the children of gad after their families the cities and their villages 1329 and moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of manasseh and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children of manasseh by their families 1330 and their coast was from mahanaim all bashan all the kingdom of og king of bashan and all the towns of jair which are in bashan threescore cities 1331 and half gilead and ashtaroth and edrei cities of the kingdom of og in bashan were pertaining unto the children of machir the son of manasseh even to the one half of the children of machir by their families 1332 these are the countries which moses did distribute for inheritance in the plains of moab on the other side jordan by jericho eastward 1333 but unto the tribe of levi moses gave not any inheritance the lord god of israel was their inheritance as he said unto them 141 and these are the countries which the children of israel inherited in the land of canaan which eleazar the priest and joshua the son of nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of israel distributed for inheritance to them 142 by lot was their inheritance as the lord commanded by the hand of moses for the nine tribes and for the half tribe 143 for moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side jordan but unto the levites he gave none inheritance among them 144 for the children of joseph were two tribes manasseh and ephraim therefore they gave no part unto the levites in the land save cities to dwell in with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance 145 as the lord commanded moses so the children of israel did and they divided the land 146 then the children of judah came unto joshua in gilgal and caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite said unto him thou knowest the thing that the lord said unto moses the man of god concerning me and thee in kadeshbarnea 147 forty years old was i when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadeshbarnea to espy out the land and i brought him word again as it was in mine heart 148 nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god 149 and moses sware on that day saying surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy childrens for ever because thou hast wholly followed the lord my god 1410 and now behold the lord hath kept me alive as he said these forty and five years even since the lord spake this word unto moses while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo i am this day fourscore and five years old 1411 as yet i am as strong this day as i was in the day that moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for war both to go out and to come in 1412 now therefore give me this mountain whereof the lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the anakims were there and that the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord will be with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord said 1413 and joshua blessed him and gave unto caleb the son of jephunneh hebron for an inheritance 1414 hebron therefore became the inheritance of caleb the son of jephunneh the kenezite unto this day because that he wholly followed the lord god of israel 1415 and the name of hebron before was kirjatharba which arba was a great man among the anakims and the land had rest from war 151 this then was the lot of the tribe of the children of judah by their families even to the border of edom the wilderness of zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast 152 and their south border was from the shore of the salt sea from the bay that looketh southward 153 and it went out to the south side to maalehacrabbim and passed along to zin and ascended up on the south side unto kadeshbarnea and passed along to hezron and went up to adar and fetched a compass to karkaa 154 from thence it passed toward azmon and went out unto the river of egypt and the goings out of that coast were at the sea this shall be your south coast 155 and the east border was the salt sea even unto the end of jordan and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of jordan 156 and the border went up to bethhogla and passed along by the north of betharabah and the border went up to the stone of bohan the son of reuben 157 and the border went up toward debir from the valley of achor and so northward looking toward gilgal that is before the going up to adummim which is on the south side of the river and the border passed toward the waters of enshemesh and the goings out thereof were at enrogel 158 and the border went up by the valley of the son of hinnom unto the south side of the jebusite the same is jerusalem and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of hinnom westward which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward 159 and the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of nephtoah and went out to the cities of mount ephron and the border was drawn to baalah which is kirjathjearim 1510 and the border compassed from baalah westward unto mount seir and passed along unto the side of mount jearim which is chesalon on the north side and went down to bethshemesh and passed on to timnah 1511 and the border went out unto the side of ekron northward and the border was drawn to shicron and passed along to mount baalah and went out unto jabneel and the goings out of the border were at the sea 1512 and the west border was to the great sea and the coast thereof this is the coast of the children of judah round about according to their families 1513 and unto caleb the son of jephunneh he gave a part among the children of judah according to the commandment of the lord to joshua even the city of arba the father of anak which city is hebron 1514 and caleb drove thence the three sons of anak sheshai and ahiman and talmai the children of anak 1515 and he went up thence to the inhabitants of debir and the name of debir before was kirjathsepher 1516 and caleb said he that smiteth kirjathsepher and taketh it to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife 1517 and othniel the son of kenaz the brother of caleb took it and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife 1518 and it came to pass as she came unto him that she moved him to ask of her father a field and she lighted off her ass and caleb said unto her what wouldest thou 1519 who answered give me a blessing for thou hast given me a south land give me also springs of water and he gave her the upper springs and the nether springs 1520 this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of judah according to their families 1521 and the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of judah toward the coast of edom southward were kabzeel and eder and jagur 1522 and kinah and dimonah and adadah 1523 and kedesh and hazor and ithnan 1524 ziph and telem and bealoth 1525 and hazor hadattah and kerioth and hezron which is hazor 1526 amam and shema and moladah 1527 and hazargaddah and heshmon and bethpalet 1528 and hazarshual and beersheba and bizjothjah 1529 baalah and iim and azem 1530 and eltolad and chesil and hormah 1531 and ziklag and madmannah and sansannah 1532 and lebaoth and shilhim and ain and rimmon all the cities are twenty and nine with their villages 1533 and in the valley eshtaol and zoreah and ashnah 1534 and zanoah and engannim tappuah and enam 1535 jarmuth and adullam socoh and azekah 1536 and sharaim and adithaim and gederah and gederothaim fourteen cities with their villages 1537 zenan and hadashah and migdalgad 1538 and dilean and mizpeh and joktheel 1539 lachish and bozkath and eglon 1540 and cabbon and lahmam and kithlish 1541 and gederoth bethdagon and naamah and makkedah sixteen cities with their villages 1542 libnah and ether and ashan 1543 and jiphtah and ashnah and nezib 1544 and keilah and achzib and mareshah nine cities with their villages 1545 ekron with her towns and her villages 1546 from ekron even unto the sea all that lay near ashdod with their villages 1547 ashdod with her towns and her villages gaza with her towns and her villages unto the river of egypt and the great sea and the border thereof 1548 and in the mountains shamir and jattir and socoh 1549 and dannah and kirjathsannah which is debir 1550 and anab and eshtemoh and anim 1551 and goshen and holon and giloh eleven cities with their villages 1552 arab and dumah and eshean 1553 and janum and bethtappuah and aphekah 1554 and humtah and kirjatharba which is hebron and zior nine cities with their villages 1555 maon carmel and ziph and juttah 1556 and jezreel and jokdeam and zanoah 1557 cain gibeah and timnah ten cities with their villages 1558 halhul bethzur and gedor 1559 and maarath and bethanoth and eltekon six cities with their villages 1560 kirjathbaal which is kirjathjearim and rabbah two cities with their villages 1561 in the wilderness betharabah middin and secacah 1562 and nibshan and the city of salt and engedi six cities with their villages 1563 as for the jebusites the inhabitants of jerusalem the children of judah could not drive them out but the jebusites dwell with the children of judah at jerusalem unto this day 161 and the lot of the children of joseph fell from jordan by jericho unto the water of jericho on the east to the wilderness that goeth up from jericho throughout mount bethel 162 and goeth out from bethel to luz and passeth along unto the borders of archi to ataroth 163 and goeth down westward to the coast of japhleti unto the coast of bethhoron the nether and to gezer and the goings out thereof are at the sea 164 so the children of joseph manasseh and ephraim took their inheritance 165 and the border of the children of ephraim according to their families was thus even the border of their inheritance on the east side was atarothaddar unto bethhoron the upper 166 and the border went out toward the sea to michmethah on the north side and the border went about eastward unto taanathshiloh and passed by it on the east to janohah 167 and it went down from janohah to ataroth and to naarath and came to jericho and went out at jordan 168 the border went out from tappuah westward unto the river kanah and the goings out thereof were at the sea this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of ephraim by their families 169 and the separate cities for the children of ephraim were among the inheritance of the children of manasseh all the cities with their villages 1610 and they drave not out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer but the canaanites dwell among the ephraimites unto this day and serve under tribute 171 there was also a lot for the tribe of manasseh for he was the firstborn of joseph to wit for machir the firstborn of manasseh the father of gilead because he was a man of war therefore he had gilead and bashan 172 there was also a lot for the rest of the children of manasseh by their families for the children of abiezer and for the children of helek and for the children of asriel and for the children of shechem and for the children of hepher and for the children of shemida these were the male children of manasseh the son of joseph by their families 173 but zelophehad the son of hepher the son of gilead the son of machir the son of manasseh had no sons but daughters and these are the names of his daughters mahlah and noah hoglah milcah and tirzah 174 and they came near before eleazar the priest and before joshua the son of nun and before the princes saying the lord commanded moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren therefore according to the commandment of the lord he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father 175 and there fell ten portions to manasseh beside the land of gilead and bashan which were on the other side jordan 176 because the daughters of manasseh had an inheritance among his sons and the rest of manassehs sons had the land of gilead 177 and the coast of manasseh was from asher to michmethah that lieth before shechem and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of entappuah 178 now manasseh had the land of tappuah but tappuah on the border of manasseh belonged to the children of ephraim 179 and the coast descended unto the river kanah southward of the river these cities of ephraim are among the cities of manasseh the coast of manasseh also was on the north side of the river and the outgoings of it were at the sea 1710 southward it was ephraims and northward it was manassehs and the sea is his border and they met together in asher on the north and in issachar on the east 1711 and manasseh had in issachar and in asher bethshean and her towns and ibleam and her towns and the inhabitants of dor and her towns and the inhabitants of endor and her towns and the inhabitants of taanach and her towns and the inhabitants of megiddo and her towns even three countries 1712 yet the children of manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities but the canaanites would dwell in that land 1713 yet it came to pass when the children of israel were waxen strong that they put the canaanites to tribute but did not utterly drive them out 1714 and the children of joseph spake unto joshua saying why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit seeing i am a great people forasmuch as the lord hath blessed me hitherto 1715 and joshua answered them if thou be a great people then get thee up to the wood country and cut down for thyself there in the land of the perizzites and of the giants if mount ephraim be too narrow for thee 1716 and the children of joseph said the hill is not enough for us and all the canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron both they who are of bethshean and her towns and they who are of the valley of jezreel 1717 and joshua spake unto the house of joseph even to ephraim and to manasseh saying thou art a great people and hast great power thou shalt not have one lot only 1718 but the mountain shall be thine for it is a wood and thou shalt cut it down and the outgoings of it shall be thine for thou shalt drive out the canaanites though they have iron chariots and though they be strong 181 and the whole congregation of the children of israel

cities were every one with their suburbs round about them thus were all these cities 2143 and the lord gave unto israel all the land which he sware to give unto their fathers and they possessed it and dwelt therein 2144 and the lord gave them rest round about according to all that he sware unto their fathers and there stood not a man of all their enemies before them the lord delivered all their enemies into their hand 2145 there failed not ought of any good thing which the lord had spoken unto the house of israel all came to pass 221 then joshua called the reubenites and the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh 222 and said unto them ye have kept all that moses the servant of the lord commanded you and have obeyed my voice in all that i commanded you 223 ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day but have kept the charge of the commandment of the lord your god 224 and now the lord your god hath given rest unto your brethren as he promised them therefore now return ye and get you unto your tents and unto the land of your possession which moses the servant of the lord gave you on the other side jordan 225 but take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which moses the servant of the lord charged you to love the lord your god and to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and to cleave unto him and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul 226 so joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went unto their tents 227 now to the one half of the tribe of manasseh moses had given possession in bashan but unto the other half thereof gave joshua among their brethren on this side jordan westward and when joshua sent them away also unto their tents then he blessed them 228 and he spake unto them saying return with much riches unto your tents and with very much cattle with silver and with gold and with brass and with iron and with very much raiment divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren 229 and the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh returned and departed from the children of israel out of shiloh which is in the land of canaan to go unto the country of gilead to the land of their possession whereof they were possessed according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses 2210 and when they came unto the borders of jordan that are in the land of canaan the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh built there an altar by jordan a great altar to see to 2211 and the children of israel heard say behold the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh have built an altar over against the land of canaan in the borders of jordan at the passage of the children of israel 2212 and when the children of israel heard of it the whole congregation of the children of israel gathered themselves together at shiloh to go up to war against them 2213 and the children of israel sent unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the half tribe of manasseh into the land of gilead phinehas the son of eleazar the priest 2214 and with him ten princes of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of israel and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of israel 2215 and they came unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the half tribe of manasseh unto the land of gilead and they spake with them saying 2216 thus saith the whole congregation of the lord what trespass is this that ye have committed against the god of israel to turn away this day from following the lord in that ye have builded you an altar that ye might rebel this day against the lord 2217 is the iniquity of peor too little for us from which we are not cleansed until this day although there was a plague in the congregation of the lord 2218 but that ye must turn away this day from following the lord and it will be seeing ye rebel to day against the lord that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of israel 2219 notwithstanding if the land of your possession be unclean then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the lord wherein the lords tabernacle dwelleth and take possession among us but rebel not against the lord nor rebel against us in building you an altar beside the altar of the lord our god 2220 did not achan the son of zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing and wrath fell on all the congregation of israel and that man perished not alone in his iniquity 2221 then the children of reuben and the children of gad and the half tribe of manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousands of israel 2222 the lord god of gods the lord god of gods he knoweth and israel he shall know if it be in rebellion or if in transgression against the lord save us not this day 2223 that we have built us an altar to turn from following the lord or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering or if to offer peace offerings thereon let the lord himself require it 2224 and if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing saying in time to come your children might speak unto our children saying what have ye to do with the lord god of israel 2225 for the lord hath made jordan a border between us and you ye children of reuben and children of gad ye have no part in the lord so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the lord 2226 therefore we said let us now prepare to build us an altar not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice 2227 but that it may be a witness between us and you and our generations after us that we might do the service of the lord before him with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your children may not say to our children in time to come ye have no part in the lord 2228 therefore said we that it shall be when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come that we may say again behold the pattern of the altar of the lord which our fathers made not for burnt offerings nor for sacrifices but it is a witness between us and you 2229 god forbid that we should rebel against the lord and turn this day from following the lord to build an altar for burnt offerings for meat offerings or for sacrifices beside the altar of the lord our god that is before his tabernacle 2230 and when phinehas the priest and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of israel which were with him heard the words that the children of reuben and the children of gad and the children of manasseh spake it pleased them 2231 and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest said unto the children of reuben and to the children of gad and to the children of manasseh this day we perceive that the lord is among us because ye have not committed this trespass against the lord now ye have delivered the children of israel out of the hand of the lord 2232 and phinehas the son of eleazar the priest and the princes returned from the children of reuben and from the children of gad out of the land of gilead unto the land of canaan to the children of israel and brought them word again 2233 and the thing pleased the children of israel and the children of israel blessed god and did not intend to go up against them in battle to destroy the land wherein the children of reuben and gad dwelt 2234 and the children of reuben and the children of gad called the altar ed for it shall be a witness between us that the lord is god 231 and it came to pass a long time after that the lord had given rest unto israel from all their enemies round about that joshua waxed old and stricken in age 232 and joshua called for all israel and for their elders and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and said unto them i am old and stricken in age 233 and ye have seen all that the lord your god hath done unto all these nations because of you for the lord your god is he that hath fought for you 234 behold i have divided unto you by lot these nations that remain to be an inheritance for your tribes from jordan with all the nations that i have cut off even unto the great sea westward 235 and the lord your god he shall expel them from before you and drive them from out of your sight and ye shall possess their land as the lord your god hath promised unto you 236 be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of moses that ye turn not aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left 237 that ye come not among these nations these that remain among you neither make mention of the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them neither serve them nor bow yourselves unto them 238 but cleave unto the lord your god as ye have done unto this day 239 for the lord hath driven out from before you great nations and strong but as for you no man hath been able to stand before you unto this day 2310 one man of you shall chase a thousand for the lord your god he it is that fighteth for you as he hath promised you 2311 take good heed therefore unto yourselves that ye love the lord your god 2312 else if ye do in any wise go back and cleave unto the remnant of these nations even these that remain among you and shall make marriages with them and go in unto them and they to you 2313 know for a certainty that the lord your god will no more drive out any of these nations from before you but they shall be snares and traps unto you and scourges in your sides and thorns in your eyes until ye perish from off this good land which the lord your god hath given you 2314 and behold this day i am going the way of all the earth and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one thing hath failed of all the good things which the lord your god spake concerning you all are come to pass unto you and not one thing hath failed thereof 2315 therefore it shall come to pass that as all good things are come upon you which the lord your god promised you so shall the lord bring upon you all evil things until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the lord your god hath given you 2316 when ye have transgressed the covenant of the lord your god which he commanded you and have gone and served other gods and bowed yourselves to them then shall the anger of the lord be kindled against you and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land which he hath given unto you 241 and joshua gathered all the tribes of israel to shechem and called for the elders of israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and they presented themselves before god 242 and joshua said unto all the people thus saith the lord god of israel your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time even terah the father of abraham and the father of nachor and they served other gods 243 and i took your father abraham from the other side of the flood and led him throughout all the land of canaan and multiplied his seed and gave him isaac 244 and i gave unto isaac jacob and esau and i gave unto esau mount seir to possess it but jacob and his children went down into egypt 245 i sent moses also and aaron and i plagued egypt according to that which i did among them and afterward i brought you out 246 and i brought your fathers out of egypt and ye came unto the sea and the egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the red sea 247 and when they cried unto the lord he put darkness between you and the egyptians and brought the sea upon them and covered them and your eyes have seen what i have done in egypt and ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season 248 and i brought you into the land of the amorites which dwelt on the other side jordan and they fought with you and i gave them into your hand that ye might possess their land and i destroyed them from before you 249 then balak the son of zippor king of moab arose and warred against israel and sent and called balaam the son of beor to curse you 2410 but i would not hearken unto balaam therefore he blessed you still so i delivered you out of his hand 2411 and you went over jordan and came unto jericho and the men of jericho fought against you the amorites and the perizzites and the canaanites and the hittites and the girgashites the hivites and the jebusites and i delivered them into your hand 2412 and i sent the hornet before you which drave them out from before you even the two kings of the amorites but not with thy sword nor with thy bow 2413 and i have given you a land for which ye did not labour and cities which ye built not and ye dwell in them of the vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat 2414 now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood and in egypt and serve ye the lord 2415 and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord 2416 and the people answered and said god forbid that we should forsake the lord to serve other gods 2417 for the lord our god he it is that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage and which did those great signs in our sight and preserved us in all the way wherein we went and among all the people through whom we passed 2418 and the lord drave out from before us all the people even the amorites which dwelt in the land therefore will we also serve the lord for he is our god 2419 and joshua said unto the people ye cannot serve the lord for he is an holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins 2420 if ye forsake the lord and serve strange gods then he will turn and do you hurt and consume you after that he hath done you good 2421 and the people said unto joshua nay but we will serve the lord 2422 and joshua said unto the people ye are witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the lord to serve him and they said we are witnesses 2423 now therefore put away said he the strange gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the lord god of israel 2424 and the people said unto joshua the lord our god will we serve and his voice will we obey 2425 so joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them a statute and an ordinance in shechem 2426 and joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of god and took a great stone and set it up there under an oak that was by the sanctuary of the lord 2427 and joshua said unto all the people behold this stone shall be a witness unto us for it hath heard all the words of the lord which he spake unto us it shall be therefore a witness unto you lest ye deny your god 2428 so joshua let the people depart every man unto his inheritance 2429 and it came to pass after these things that joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord died being an hundred and ten years old 2430 and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnathserah which is in mount ephraim on the north side of the hill of gaash 2431 and israel served the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders that overlived joshua and which had known all the works of the lord that he had done for israel 2432 and the bones of joseph which the children of israel brought up out of egypt buried they in shechem in a parcel of ground which jacob bought of the sons of hamor the father of shechem for an hundred pieces of silver and it became the inheritance of the children of joseph 2433 and eleazar the son of aaron died and they buried him in a hill that pertained to phinehas his son which was given him in mount ephraim the book of judges 11 now after the death of joshua it came to pass that the children of israel asked the lord saying who shall go up for us against the canaanites first to fight against them 12 and the lord said judah shall go up behold i have delivered the land into his hand 13 and judah said unto simeon his brother come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the canaanites and i likewise will go with thee into thy lot so simeon went with him 14 and judah went up and the lord delivered the canaanites and the perizzites into their hand and they slew of them in bezek ten thousand men 15 and they found adonibezek in bezek and they fought against him and they slew the canaanites and the perizzites 16 but adonibezek fled and they pursued after him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his great toes 17 and adonibezek said threescore and ten kings having their thumbs and their great toes cut off gathered their meat under my table as i have done so god hath requited me and they brought him to jerusalem and there he died 18 now the children of judah had fought against jerusalem and had taken it and smitten it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire 19 and afterward the children of judah went down to fight against the canaanites that dwelt in the mountain and in the south and in the valley 110 and judah went against the canaanites that dwelt in hebron now the name of hebron before was kirjatharba and they slew sheshai and ahiman and talmai 111 and from thence he went against the inhabitants of debir and the name of debir before was kirjathsepher 112 and caleb said he that smiteth kirjathsepher and taketh it to him will i give achsah my daughter to wife 113 and othniel the son of kenaz calebs younger brother took it and he gave him achsah his daughter to wife 114 and it came to pass when she came to him that she moved him to ask of her father a field and she lighted from off her ass and caleb said unto her what wilt thou 115 and she said unto him give me a blessing for thou hast given me a south land give me also springs of water and caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs 116 and the children of the kenite moses father in law went up out of the city of palm trees with the children of judah into the wilderness of judah which lieth in the south of arad and they went and dwelt among the people 117 and judah went with simeon his brother and they slew the canaanites that inhabited zephath and utterly destroyed it and the name of the city was called hormah 118 also judah took gaza with the coast thereof and askelon with the coast thereof and ekron with the coast thereof 119 and the lord was with judah and he drave out the inhabitants of the mountain but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron 120 and they gave hebron unto caleb as moses said and he expelled thence the three sons of anak 121 and the children of benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of benjamin in jerusalem unto this day 122 and the house of joseph they also went up against bethel and the lord was with them 123 and the house of joseph sent to descry bethel now the name of the city before was luz 124 and the spies saw a man come forth out of the city and they said unto him shew us we pray thee the entrance into the city and we will shew thee mercy 125 and when he shewed them the entrance into the city they smote the city with the edge of the sword but they let go the man and all his family 126 and the man went into the land of the hittites and built a city and called the name thereof luz which is the name thereof unto this day 127 neither did manasseh drive out the inhabitants of bethshean and her towns nor taanach and her towns nor the inhabitants of dor and her towns nor the inhabitants of ibleam and her towns nor the inhabitants of megiddo and her towns but the canaanites would dwell in that land 128 and it came to pass when israel was strong that they put the canaanites to tribute and did not utterly drive them out 129 neither did ephraim drive out the canaanites that dwelt in gezer but the canaanites dwelt in gezer among them 130 neither did zebulun drive out the inhabitants of kitron nor the inhabitants of nahalol but the canaanites dwelt among them and became tributaries 131 neither did asher drive out the inhabitants of accho nor the inhabitants of zidon nor of ahlab nor of achzib nor of helbah nor of aphik nor of rehob 132 but the asherites dwelt among the canaanites the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them out 133 neither did naphtali drive out the inhabitants of bethshemesh nor the inhabitants of bethanath but he dwelt among the canaanites the inhabitants of the land nevertheless the inhabitants of bethshemesh and of bethanath became tributaries unto them 134 and the amorites forced the children of dan into the mountain for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley 135 but the amorites would dwell in mount heres in aijalon and in shaalbim yet the hand of the house of joseph prevailed so that they became tributaries 136 and the coast of the amorites was from the going up to akrabbim from the rock and upward 21 and an angel of the lord came up from gilgal to bochim and said i made you to go up out of egypt and have brought you unto the land which i sware unto your fathers and i said i will never break my covenant with you 22 and ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land ye shall throw down their altars but ye have not obeyed my voice why have ye done this 23 wherefore i also said i will not drive them out from before you but they shall be as thorns in your sides and their gods shall be a snare unto you 24 and it came to pass when the angel of the lord spake these words unto all the children of israel that the people lifted up their voice and wept 25 and they called the name of that place bochim and they sacrificed there unto the lord 26 and when joshua had let the people go the children of israel went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land 27 and the people served the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders that outlived joshua who had seen all the great works of the lord that he did for israel 28 and joshua the son of nun the servant of the lord died being an hundred and ten years old 29 and they buried him in the border of his inheritance in timnathheres in the mount of ephraim on the north side of the hill gaash 210 and also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the lord nor yet the works which he had done for israel 211 and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and served baalim 212 and they forsook the lord god of their fathers which brought them out of the land of egypt and followed other gods of the gods of the people that were round about them and bowed themselves unto them and provoked the lord to anger 213 and they forsook the lord and served baal and ashtaroth 214 and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies 215 whithersoever they went out the hand of the lord was against them for evil as the lord had said and as the lord had sworn unto them and they were greatly distressed 216 nevertheless the lord raised up judges which delivered them out of the hand of those that spoiled them 217 and yet they would not hearken unto their judges but they went a whoring after other gods and bowed themselves unto them they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in obeying the commandments of the lord but they did not so 218 and when the lord raised them up judges then the lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for it repented the lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them 219 and it came to pass when the judge was dead that they returned and corrupted themselves more than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them they ceased not from their own doings nor from their stubborn way 220 and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he said because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which i commanded their fathers and have not hearkened unto my voice 221 i also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations which joshua left when he died 222 that through them i may prove israel whether they will keep the way of the lord to walk therein as their fathers did keep it or not 223 therefore the lord left those nations without driving them out hastily neither delivered he them into the hand of joshua 31 now these are the nations which the lord left to prove israel by them even as many of israel as had not known all the wars of canaan 32 only that the generations of the children of israel might know to teach them war at the least such as before knew nothing thereof 33 namely five lords of the philistines and all the canaanites and the sidonians and the hivites that dwelt in mount lebanon from mount baalhermon unto the entering in of hamath 34 and they were to prove israel by them to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the lord which he commanded their fathers by the hand of moses 35 and the children of israel dwelt among the canaanites hittites and amorites and perizzites and hivites and jebusites 36 and they took their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters to their sons and served their gods 37 and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and forgat the lord their god and served baalim and the groves 38 therefore the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he sold them into the hand of chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia and the children of israel served chushanrishathaim eight years 39 and when the children of israel cried unto the lord the lord raised up a deliverer to the children of israel who delivered them even othniel the son of kenaz calebs younger brother 310 and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he judged israel and went out to war and the lord delivered chushanrishathaim king of mesopotamia into his hand and his hand prevailed against chushanrishathaim 311 and the land had rest forty years and othniel the son of kenaz died 312 and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and the lord strengthened eglon the king of moab against israel because they had done evil in the sight of the lord 313 and he gathered unto him the children of ammon and amalek and went and smote israel and possessed the city of palm trees 314 so the children of israel served eglon the king of moab eighteen years 315 but when the children of israel cried unto the lord the lord raised them up a deliverer ehud the son of gera a benjamite a man lefthanded and by him the children of israel sent a present unto eglon the king of moab 316 but ehud made him a dagger which had two edges of a cubit length and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh 317 and he brought the present unto eglon king of moab and eglon was a very fat man 318 and when he had made an end to offer the present he sent away the people that bare the present 319 but he himself turned again from the quarries that were by gilgal and said i have a secret errand unto thee o king who said keep silence and all that stood by him went out from him 320 and ehud came unto him and he was sitting in a summer parlour which he had for himself alone and ehud said i have a message from god unto thee and he arose out of his seat 321 and ehud put forth his left hand and took the dagger from his right thigh and thrust it into his belly 322 and the haft also went in after the blade and the fat closed upon the blade so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly and the dirt came out 323 then ehud went forth through the porch and shut the doors of the parlour upon him and locked them 324 when he was gone out his servants came and when they saw that behold the doors of the parlour were locked they said surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber 325 and they tarried till they were ashamed and behold he opened not the doors of the parlour therefore they took a key and opened them and behold their lord was fallen down dead on the earth 326 and ehud escaped while they tarried and passed beyond the quarries and escaped unto seirath 327 and it came to pass when he was come that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of ephraim and the children of israel went down with him from the mount and he before them 328 and he said unto them follow after me for the lord hath delivered your enemies the moabites into your hand and they went down after him and took the fords of jordan toward moab and suffered not a man to pass over 329 and they slew of moab at that time about ten thousand men all lusty and all men of valour and there escaped not a man 330 so moab was subdued that day under the hand of israel and the land had rest fourscore years 331 and after him was shamgar the son of anath which slew of the philistines six hundred men with an ox goad and he also delivered israel 41 and the children of israel again did evil in the sight of the lord when ehud was dead 42 and the lord sold them into the hand of jabin king of canaan that reigned in hazor the captain of whose host was sisera which dwelt in harosheth of the gentiles 43 and the children of israel cried unto the lord for he had nine hundred chariots of iron and twenty years he mightily oppressed the children of israel 44 and deborah a prophetess the wife of lapidoth she judged israel at that time 45 and she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah between ramah and bethel in mount ephraim and the children of israel came up to her for judgment 46 and she sent and called barak the son of abinoam out of kedeshnaphtali and said unto him hath not the lord god of israel commanded saying go and draw toward mount tabor and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of naphtali and of the children of zebulun 47 and i will draw unto thee to the river kishon sisera the captain of jabins army with his chariots and his multitude and i will deliver him into thine hand 48 and barak said unto her if thou wilt go with me then i will go but if thou wilt not go with me then i will not go 49 and she said i will surely go with thee notwithstanding the journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour for the lord shall sell sisera into the hand of a woman and deborah arose and went with barak to kedesh 410 and barak called zebulun and naphtali to kedesh and he went up with ten thousand men at his feet and deborah went up with him 411 now heber the kenite which was of the children of hobab the father in law of moses had severed himself from the kenites and pitched his tent unto the plain of zaanaim which is by kedesh 412 and they shewed sisera that barak the son of abinoam was gone up to mount tabor 413 and sisera gathered together all his chariots even nine hundred chariots of iron and all the people that were with him from harosheth of the gentiles unto the river of kishon 414 and deborah said unto barak up for this is the day in which the lord hath delivered sisera into thine hand is not the lord gone out before thee so barak went down from mount tabor and ten thousand men after him 415 and the lord discomfited sisera and all his chariots and all his host with the edge of the sword before barak so that sisera lighted down off his chariot and fled away on his feet 416 but barak pursued after the chariots and after the host unto harosheth of the gentiles and all the host of sisera fell upon the edge of the sword and there was not a man left 417 howbeit sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of jael the wife of heber the kenite for there was peace between jabin the king of hazor and the house of heber the kenite 418 and jael went out to meet sisera and said unto him turn in my lord turn in to me fear not and when he had turned in unto her into the tent she covered him with a mantle 419 and he said unto her give me i pray thee a little water to drink for i am thirsty and she opened a bottle of milk and gave him drink and covered him 420 again he said unto her stand in the door of the tent and it shall be when any man doth come and enquire of thee and say is there any man here that thou shalt say no 421 then jael hebers wife took a nail of the tent and took an hammer in her hand and went softly unto him and smote the nail into his temples and fastened it into the ground for he was fast asleep and weary so he died 422 and behold as barak pursued sisera jael came out to meet him and said unto him come and i will shew thee the man whom thou seekest and when he came into her tent behold sisera lay dead and the nail was in his temples 423 so god subdued on that day jabin the king of canaan before the children of israel 424 and the hand of the children of israel prospered and prevailed against jabin the king of canaan until they had destroyed jabin king of canaan 51 then sang deborah and barak the son of abinoam on that day saying 52 praise ye the lord for the avenging of israel when the people willingly offered themselves 53 hear o ye kings give ear o ye princes i even i will sing unto the lord i will sing praise to the lord god of israel 54 lord when thou wentest out of seir when thou marchedst out of the field of edom the earth trembled and the heavens dropped the clouds also dropped water 55 the mountains melted from before the lord even that sinai from before the lord god of israel 56 in the days of shamgar the son of anath in the days of jael the highways were unoccupied and the travellers walked through byways 57 the inhabitants of the villages ceased they ceased in israel until that i deborah arose that i arose a mother in israel 58 they chose new gods then was war in the gates was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in israel 59 my heart is toward the governors of israel that offered themselves willingly among the people bless ye the lord 510 speak ye that ride on white asses ye that sit in judgment and walk by the way 511 they that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places of drawing water there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the lord even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in israel then shall the people of the lord go down to the gates 512 awake awake deborah awake awake utter a song arise barak and lead thy captivity captive thou son of abinoam 513 then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles among the people the lord made me have dominion over the mighty 514 out of ephraim was there a root of them against amalek after thee benjamin among thy people out of machir came down governors and out of zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer 515 and the princes of issachar were with deborah even issachar and also barak he was sent on foot into the valley for the divisions of reuben there were great thoughts of heart 516 why abodest thou among the sheepfolds to hear the bleatings of the flocks for the divisions of reuben there were great searchings of heart 517 gilead abode beyond jordan and why did dan remain in ships asher continued on the sea shore and abode in his breaches 518 zebulun and naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field 519 the kings came and fought then fought the kings of canaan in taanach by the waters of megiddo they took no gain of money 520 they fought from heaven the stars in their courses fought against sisera 521 the river of kishon swept them away that ancient river the river kishon o my soul thou hast trodden down strength 522 then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings the pransings of their mighty ones 523 curse ye meroz said the angel of the lord curse ye bitterly the inhabitants thereof because they came not to the help of the lord to the help of the lord against the mighty 524 blessed above women shall jael the wife of heber the kenite be blessed shall she be above women in the tent 525 he asked water and she gave him milk she brought forth butter in a lordly dish 526 she put her hand to the nail and her right hand to the workmens hammer and with the hammer she smote sisera she smote off his head when she had pierced and stricken through his temples 527 at her feet he bowed he fell he lay down at her feet he bowed he fell where he bowed there he fell down dead 528 the mother of sisera looked out at a window and cried through the lattice why is his chariot so long in coming why tarry the wheels of his chariots 529 her wise ladies answered her yea she returned answer to herself 530 have they not sped have they not divided the prey to every man a damsel or two to sisera a prey of divers colours a prey of divers colours of needlework of divers colours of needlework on both sides meet for the necks of them that take the spoil 531 so let all thine enemies perish o lord but let them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might and the land had rest forty years 61 and the children of israel did evil in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of midian seven years 62 and the hand of midian prevailed against israel and because of the midianites the children of israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strong holds 63 and so it was when israel had sown that the midianites came up and the amalekites and the children of the east even they came up against them 64 and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till thou come unto gaza and left no sustenance for israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass 65 for they came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it 66 and israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and the children of israel cried unto the lord 67 and it came to pass when the children of israel cried unto the lord because of the midianites 68 that the lord sent a prophet unto the children of israel which said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel i brought you up from egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage 69 and i delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and gave you their land 610 and i said unto you i am the lord your god fear not the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice 611 and there came an angel of the lord and sat under an oak which was in ophrah that pertained unto joash the abiezrite and his son gideon threshed wheat by the winepress to hide it from the midianites 612 and the angel of the lord appeared unto him and said unto him the lord is with thee thou mighty man of valour 613 and gideon said unto him oh my lord if the lord be with us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the lord bring us up from egypt but now the lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites 614 and the lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save israel from the hand of the midianites have not i sent thee 615 and he said unto him oh my lord wherewith shall i save israel behold my family is poor in manasseh and i am the least in my fathers house 616 and the lord said unto him surely i will be with thee and thou shalt smite the midianites as one man 617 and he said unto him if now i have found grace in thy sight then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me 618 depart not hence i pray thee until i come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee and he said i will tarry until thou come again 619 and gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and brought it out unto him under the oak and presented it 620 and the angel of god said unto him take the flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth and he did so 621 then the angel of the lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes and there rose up fire out of the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes then the angel of the lord departed out of his sight 622 and when gideon perceived that he was an angel of the lord gideon said alas o lord god for because i have seen an angel of the lord face to face 623 and the lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou shalt not die 624 then gideon built an altar there unto the lord and called it jehovahshalom unto this day it is yet in ophrah of the abiezrites 625 and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him take thy fathers young bullock even the second bullock of seven years old and throw down the altar of baal that thy father hath and cut down the grove that is by it 626 and build an altar unto the lord thy god upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take the second bullock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down 627 then gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the lord had said unto him and so it was because he feared his fathers household and the men of the city that he could not do it by day that he did it by night 628 and when the men of the city arose early in the morning behold the altar of baal was cast down and the grove was cut down that was by it and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built 629 and they said one to another who hath done this thing and when they enquired and asked they said gideon the son of joash hath done this thing 630 then the men of the city said unto joash bring out thy son that he may die because he hath cast down the altar of baal and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it 631 and joash said unto all that stood against him will ye plead for baal will ye save him he that will plead for him let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning if he be a god let him plead for himself because one hath cast down his altar 632 therefore on that day he called him jerubbaal saying let baal plead against him because he hath thrown down his altar 633 then all the midianites and the amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together and went over and pitched in the valley of jezreel 634 but the spirit of the lord came upon gideon and he blew a trumpet and abiezer was gathered after him 635 and he sent messengers throughout all manasseh who also was gathered after him and he sent messengers unto asher and unto zebulun and unto naphtali and they came up to meet them 636 and gideon said unto god if thou wilt save israel by mine hand as thou hast said 637 behold i will put a fleece of wool in the floor and if the dew be on the fleece only and it be dry upon all the earth beside then shall i know that thou wilt save israel by mine hand as thou hast said 638 and it was so for he rose up early on the morrow and thrust the fleece together and wringed the dew out of the fleece a bowl full of water 639 and gideon said unto god let not thine anger be hot against me and i will speak but this once let me prove i pray thee but this once with the fleece let it now be dry only upon the fleece and upon all the ground let there be dew 640 and god did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only and there was dew on all the ground 71 then jerubbaal who is gideon and all the people that were with him rose up early and pitched beside the well of harod so that the host of the midianites were on the north side of them by the hill of moreh in the valley 72 and the lord said unto gideon the people that are with thee are too many for me to give the midianites into their hands lest israel vaunt themselves against me saying mine own hand hath saved me 73 now therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people saying whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from mount gilead and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand and there remained ten thousand 74 and the lord said unto gideon the people are yet too many bring them down unto the water and i will try them for thee there and it shall be that of whom i say unto thee this shall go with thee the same shall go with thee and of whomsoever i say unto thee this shall not go with thee the same shall not go 75 so he brought down the people unto the water and the lord said unto gideon every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue as a dog lappeth him shalt thou set by himself likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink 76 and the number of them that lapped putting their hand to their mouth were three hundred men but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water 77 and the lord said unto gideon by the three hundred men that lapped will i save you and deliver the midianites into thine hand and let all the other people go every man unto his place 78 so the people took victuals in their hand and their trumpets and he sent all the rest of israel every man unto his tent and retained those three hundred men and the host of midian was beneath him in the valley 79 and it came to pass the same night that the lord said unto him arise get thee down unto the host for i have delivered it into thine hand 710 but if thou fear to go down go thou with phurah thy servant down to the host 711 and thou shalt hear what they say and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host then went he down with phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host 712 and the midianites and the amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude and their camels were without number as the sand by the sea side for multitude 713 and when gideon was come behold there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow and said behold i dreamed a dream and lo a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of midian and came unto a tent and smote it that it fell and overturned it that the tent lay along 714 and his fellow answered and said this is nothing else save the sword of gideon the son of joash a man of israel for into his hand hath god delivered midian and all the host 715 and it was so when gideon heard the telling of the dream and the interpretation thereof that he worshipped and returned into the host of israel and said arise for the lord hath delivered into your hand the host of midian 716 and he divided the three hundred men into three companies and he put a trumpet in every mans hand with empty pitchers and lamps within the pitchers 717 and he said unto them look on me and do likewise and behold when i come to the outside of the camp it shall be that as i do so shall ye do 718 when i blow with a trumpet i and all that are with me then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and say the sword of the lord and of gideon 719 so gideon and the hundred men that were with him came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch and they had but newly set the watch and they blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers that were in their hands 720 and the three companies blew the trumpets and brake the pitchers and held the lamps in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal and they cried the sword of the lord and of gideon 721 and they stood every man in his place round about the camp and all the host ran and cried and fled 722 and the three hundred blew the trumpets and the lord set every mans sword against his fellow even throughout all the host and the host fled to bethshittah in zererath and to the border of abelmeholah unto tabbath 723 and the men of israel gathered themselves together out of naphtali and out of asher and out of all manasseh and pursued after the midianites 724 and gideon sent messengers throughout all mount ephraim saying come down against the midianites and take before them the waters unto bethbarah and jordan then all the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and took the waters unto bethbarah and jordan 725 and they took two princes of the midianites oreb and zeeb and they slew oreb upon the rock oreb and zeeb they slew at the winepress of zeeb and pursued midian and brought the heads of oreb and zeeb to gideon on the other side jordan 81 and the men of ephraim said unto him why hast thou served us thus that thou calledst us not when thou wentest to fight with the midianites and they did chide with him sharply 82 and he said unto them what have i done now in comparison of you is not the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim better than the vintage of abiezer 83 god hath delivered into your hands the princes of midian oreb and zeeb and what was i able to do in comparison of you then their anger was abated toward him when he had said that 84 and gideon came to jordan and passed over he and the three hundred men that were with him faint yet pursuing them 85 and he said unto the men of succoth give i pray you loaves of bread unto the people that follow me for they be faint and i am pursuing after zebah and zalmunna kings of midian 86 and the princes of succoth said are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thine army 87 and gideon said therefore when the lord hath delivered zebah and zalmunna into mine hand then i will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers 88 and he went up thence to penuel and spake unto them likewise and the men of penuel answered him as the men of succoth had answered him 89 and he spake also unto the men of penuel saying when i come again in peace i will break down this tower 810 now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor and their hosts with them about fifteen thousand men all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword 811 and gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of nobah and jogbehah and smote the host for the host was secure 812 and when zebah and zalmunna fled he pursued after them and took the two kings of midian zebah and zalmunna and discomfited all the host 813 and gideon the son of joash returned from battle before the sun was up 814 and caught a young man of the men of succoth and enquired of him and he described unto him the princes of succoth and the elders thereof even threescore and seventeen men 815 and he came unto the men of succoth and said behold zebah and zalmunna with whom ye did upbraid me saying are the hands of zebah and zalmunna now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary 816 and he took the elders of the city and thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them he taught the men of succoth 817 and he beat down the tower of penuel and slew the men of the city 818 then said he unto zebah and zalmunna what manner of men were they whom ye slew at tabor and they answered as thou art so were they each one resembled the children of a king 819 and he said they were my brethren even the sons of my mother as the lord liveth if ye had saved them alive i would not slay you 820 and he said unto jether his firstborn up and slay them but the youth drew not his sword for he feared because he was yet a youth 821 then zebah and zalmunna said rise thou and fall upon us for as the man is so is his strength and gideon arose and slew zebah and zalmunna and took away the ornaments that were on their camels necks 822 then the men of israel said unto gideon rule thou over us both thou and thy son and thy sons son also for thou hast delivered us from the hand of midian 823 and gideon said unto them i will not rule over you neither shall my son rule over you the lord shall rule over you 824 and gideon said unto them i would desire a request of you that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey for they had golden earrings because they were ishmaelites 825 and they answered we will willingly give them and they spread a garment and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey 826 and the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold beside ornaments and collars and purple raiment that was on the kings of midian and beside the chains that were about their camels necks 827 and gideon made an ephod thereof and put it in his city even in ophrah and all israel went thither a whoring after it which thing became a snare unto gideon and to his house 828 thus was midian subdued before the children of israel so that they lifted up their heads no more and the country was in quietness forty years in the days of gideon 829 and jerubbaal the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house 830 and gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten for he had many wives 831 and his concubine that was in shechem she also bare him a son whose name he called abimelech 832 and gideon the son of joash died in a good old age and was buried in the sepulchre of joash his father in ophrah of the abiezrites 833 and it came to pass as soon as gideon was dead that the children of israel turned again and went a whoring after baalim and made baalberith their god 834 and the children of israel remembered not the lord their god who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side 835 neither shewed they kindness to the house of jerubbaal namely gideon according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto israel 91 and abimelech the son of jerubbaal went to shechem unto his mothers brethren and communed with them and with all the family of the house of his mothers father saying 92 speak i pray you in the ears of all the men of shechem whether is better for you either that all the sons of jerubbaal which are threescore and ten persons reign over you or that one reign over you remember also that i am your bone and your flesh 93 and his mothers brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men of shechem all these words and their hearts inclined to follow abimelech for they said he is our brother 94 and they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the house of baalberith wherewith abimelech hired vain and light persons which followed him 95 and he went unto his fathers house at ophrah and slew his brethren the sons of jerubbaal being threescore and ten persons upon one stone notwithstanding yet jotham the youngest son of jerubbaal was left for he hid himself 96 and all the men of shechem gathered together and all the house of millo and went and made abimelech king by the plain of the pillar that was in shechem 97 and when they told it to jotham he went and stood in the top of mount gerizim and lifted up his voice and cried and said unto them hearken unto me ye men of shechem that god may hearken unto you 98 the trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them and they said unto the olive tree reign thou over us 99 but the olive tree said unto them should i leave my fatness wherewith by me they honour god and man and go to be promoted over the trees 910 and the trees said to the fig tree come thou and reign over us 911 but the fig tree said unto them should i forsake my sweetness and my good fruit and go to be promoted over the trees 912 then said the trees unto the vine come thou and reign over us 913 and the vine said unto them should i leave my wine which cheereth god and man and go to be promoted over the trees 914 then said all the trees unto the bramble come thou and reign over us 915 and the bramble said unto the trees if in truth ye anoint me king over you then come and put your trust in my shadow and if not let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of lebanon 916 now therefore if ye have done truly and sincerely in that ye have made abimelech king and if ye have dealt well with jerubbaal and his house and have done unto him according to the deserving of his hands 917 for my father fought for you and adventured his life far and delivered you out of the hand of midian 918 and ye are risen up against my fathers house this day and have slain his sons threescore and ten persons upon one stone and have made abimelech the son of his maidservant king over the men of shechem because he is your brother 919 if ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with jerubbaal and with his house this day then rejoice ye in abimelech and let him also rejoice in you 920 but if not let fire come out from abimelech and devour the men of shechem and the house of millo and let fire come out from the men of shechem and from the house of millo and devour abimelech 921 and jotham ran away and fled and went to beer and dwelt there for fear of abimelech his brother 922 when abimelech had reigned three years over israel 923 then god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the men of shechem and the men of shechem dealt treacherously with abimelech 924 that the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of jerubbaal might come and their blood be laid upon abimelech their brother which slew them and upon the men of shechem which aided him in the killing of his brethren 925 and the men of shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains and they robbed all that came along that way by them and it was told abimelech 926 and gaal the son of ebed came with his brethren and went over to shechem and the men of shechem put their confidence in him 927 and they went out into the fields and gathered their vineyards and trode the grapes and made merry and went into the house of their god and did eat and drink and cursed abimelech 928 and gaal the son of ebed said who is abimelech and who is shechem that we should serve him is not he the son of jerubbaal and zebul his officer serve the men of hamor the father of shechem for why should we serve him 929 and would to god this people were under my hand then would i remove abimelech and he said to abimelech increase thine army and come out 930 and when zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of gaal the son of ebed his anger was kindled 931 and he sent messengers unto abimelech privily saying behold gaal the son of ebed and his brethren be come to shechem and behold they fortify the city against thee 932 now therefore up by night thou and the people that is with thee and lie in wait in the field 933 and it shall be that in the morning as soon as the sun is up thou shalt rise early and set upon the city and behold when he and the people that is with him come out against thee then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion 934 and abimelech rose up and all the people that were with him by night and they laid wait against shechem in four companies 935 and gaal the son of ebed went out and stood in the entering of the gate of the city and abimelech rose up and the people that were with him from lying in wait 936 and when gaal saw the people he said to zebul behold there come people down from the top of the mountains and zebul said unto him thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men 937 and gaal spake again and said see there come people down by the middle of the land and another company come along by the plain of meonenim 938 then said zebul unto him where is now thy mouth wherewith thou saidst who is abimelech that we should serve him is not this the people that thou hast despised go out i pray now and fight with them 939 and gaal went out before the men of shechem and fought with abimelech 940 and abimelech chased him and he fled before him and many were overthrown and wounded even unto the entering of the gate 941 and abimelech dwelt at arumah and zebul thrust out gaal and his brethren that they should not dwell in shechem 942 and it came to pass on the morrow that the people went out into the field and they told abimelech 943 and he took the people and divided them into three companies and laid wait in the field and looked and behold the people were come forth out of the city and he rose up against them and smote them 944 and abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood in the entering of the gate of the city and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields and slew them 945 and abimelech fought against the city all that day and he took the city and slew the people that was therein and beat down the city and sowed it with salt 946 and when all the men of the tower of shechem heard that they entered into an hold of the house of the god berith 947 and it was told abimelech that all the men of the tower of shechem were gathered together 948 and abimelech gat him up to mount zalmon he and all the people that were with him and abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees and took it and laid it on his shoulder and said unto the people that were with him what ye have seen me do make haste and do as i have done 949 and all the people likewise cut down every man his bough and followed abimelech and put them to the hold and set the hold on fire upon them so that all the men of the tower of shechem died also about a thousand men and women 950 then went abimelech to thebez and encamped against thebez and took it 951 but there was a strong tower within the city and thither fled all the men and women and all they of the city and shut it to them and gat them up to the top of the tower 952 and abimelech came unto the tower and fought against it and went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire 953 and a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon abimelechs head and all to brake his skull 954 then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer and said unto him draw thy sword and slay me that men say not of me a women slew him and his young man thrust him through and he died 955 and when the men of israel saw that abimelech was dead they departed every man unto his place 956 thus god rendered the wickedness of abimelech which he did unto his father in slaying his seventy brethren 957 and all the evil of the men of shechem did god render upon their heads and upon them came the curse of jotham the son of jerubbaal 101 and after abimelech there arose to defend israel tola the son of puah the son of dodo a man of issachar and he dwelt in shamir in mount ephraim 102 and he judged israel twenty and three years and died and was buried in shamir 103 and after him arose jair a gileadite and judged israel twenty and two years 104 and he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts and they had thirty cities which are called havothjair unto this day which are in the land of gilead 105 and jair died and was buried in camon 106 and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and served baalim and ashtaroth and the gods of syria and the gods of zidon and the gods of moab and the gods of the children of ammon and the gods of the philistines and forsook the lord and served not him 107 and the anger of the lord was hot against israel and he sold them into the hands of the philistines and into the hands of the children of ammon 108 and that year they vexed and oppressed the children of israel eighteen years all the children of israel that were on the other side jordan in the land of the amorites which is in gilead 109 moreover the children of ammon passed over jordan to fight also against judah and against benjamin and against the house of ephraim so that israel was sore distressed 1010 and the children of israel cried unto the lord saying we have sinned against thee both because we have forsaken our god and also served baalim 1011 and the lord said unto the children of israel did not i deliver you from the egyptians and from the amorites from the children of ammon and from the philistines 1012 the zidonians also and the amalekites and the maonites did oppress you and ye cried to me and i delivered you out of their hand 1013 yet ye have forsaken me and served other gods wherefore i will deliver you no more 1014 go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation 1015 and the children of israel said unto the lord we have sinned do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee deliver us only we pray thee this day 1016 and they put away the strange gods from among them and served the lord and his soul was grieved for the misery of israel 1017 then the children of ammon were gathered together and encamped in gilead and the children of israel assembled themselves together and encamped in mizpeh 1018 and the people and princes of gilead said one to another what man is he that will begin to fight against the children of ammon he shall be head over all the inhabitants of gilead 111 now jephthah the gileadite was a mighty man of valour and he was the son of an harlot and gilead begat jephthah 112 and gileads wife bare him sons and his wifes sons grew up and they thrust out jephthah and said unto him thou shalt not inherit in our fathers house for thou art the son of a strange woman 113 then jephthah fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land of tob and there were gathered vain men to jephthah and went out with him 114 and it came to pass in process of time that the children of ammon made war against israel 115 and it was so that when the children of ammon made war against israel the elders of gilead went to fetch jephthah out of the land of tob 116 and they said unto jephthah come and be our captain that we may fight with the children of ammon 117 and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead did not ye hate me and expel me out of my fathers house and why are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress 118 and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah therefore we turn again to thee now that thou mayest go with us and fight against the children of ammon and be our head over all the inhabitants of gilead 119 and jephthah said unto the elders of gilead if ye bring me home again to fight against the children of ammon and the lord deliver them before me shall i be your head 1110 and the elders of gilead said unto jephthah the lord be witness between us if we do not so according to thy words 1111 then jephthah went with the elders of gilead and the people made him head and captain over them and jephthah uttered all his words before the lord in mizpeh 1112 and jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of ammon saying what hast thou to do with me that thou art come against me to fight in my land 1113 and the king of the children of ammon answered unto the messengers of jephthah because israel took away my land when they came up out of egypt from arnon even unto jabbok and unto jordan now therefore restore those lands again peaceably 1114 and jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children of ammon 1115 and said unto him thus saith jephthah israel took not away the land of moab nor the land of the children of ammon 1116 but when israel came up from egypt and walked through the wilderness unto the red sea and came to kadesh 1117 then israel sent messengers unto the king of edom saying let me i pray thee pass through thy land but the king of edom would not hearken thereto and in like manner they sent unto the king of moab but he would not consent and israel abode in kadesh 1118 then they went along through the wilderness and compassed the land of edom and the land of moab and came by the east side of the land of moab and pitched on the other side of arnon but came not within the border of moab for arnon was the border of moab 1119 and israel sent messengers unto sihon king of the amorites the king of heshbon and israel said unto him let us pass we pray thee through thy land into my place 1120 but sihon trusted not israel to pass through his coast but sihon gathered all his people together and pitched in jahaz and fought against israel 1121 and the lord god of israel delivered sihon and all his people into the hand of israel and they smote them so israel possessed all the land of the amorites the inhabitants of that country 1122 and they possessed all the coasts of the amorites from arnon even unto jabbok and from the wilderness even unto jordan 1123 so now the lord god of israel hath dispossessed the amorites from before his people israel and shouldest thou possess it 1124 wilt not thou possess that which chemosh thy god giveth thee to possess so whomsoever the lord our god shall drive out from before us them will we possess 1125 and now art thou any thing better than balak the son of zippor king of moab did he ever strive against israel or did he ever fight against them 1126 while israel dwelt in heshbon and her towns and in aroer and her towns and in all the cities that be along by the coasts of arnon three hundred years why therefore did ye not recover them within that time 1127 wherefore i have not sinned against thee but thou doest me wrong to war against me the lord the judge be judge this day between the children of israel and the children of ammon 1128 howbeit the king of the children of ammon hearkened not unto the words of jephthah which he sent him 1129 then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah and he passed over gilead and manasseh and passed over mizpeh of gilead and from mizpeh of gilead he passed over unto the children of ammon 1130 and jephthah vowed a vow unto the lord and said if thou shalt without fail deliver the children of ammon into mine hands 1131 then it shall be that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me when i return in peace from the children of ammon shall surely be the lords and i will offer it up for a burnt offering 1132 so jephthah passed over unto the children of ammon to fight against them and the lord delivered them into his hands 1133 and he smote them from aroer even till thou come to minnith even twenty cities and unto the plain of the vineyards with a very great slaughter thus the children of ammon were subdued before the children of israel 1134 and jephthah came to mizpeh unto his house and behold his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances and she was his only child beside her he had neither son nor daughter 1135 and it came to pass when he saw her that he rent his clothes and said alas my daughter thou hast brought me very low and thou art one of them that trouble me for i have opened my mouth unto the lord and i cannot go back 1136 and she said unto him my father if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the lord do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of thy mouth forasmuch as the lord hath taken vengeance for thee of thine enemies even of the children of ammon 1137 and she said unto her father let this thing be done for me let me alone two months that i may go up and down upon the mountains and bewail my virginity i and my fellows 1138 and he said go and he sent her away for two months and she went with her companions and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains 1139 and it came to pass at the end of two months that she returned unto her father who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed and she knew no man and it was a custom in israel 1140 that the daughters of israel went yearly to lament the daughter of jephthah the gileadite four days in a year 121 and the men of ephraim gathered themselves together and went northward and said unto jephthah wherefore passedst thou over to fight against the children of ammon and didst not call us to go with thee we will burn thine house upon thee with fire 122 and jephthah said unto them i and my people were at great strife with the children of ammon and when i called you ye delivered me not out of their hands 123 and when i saw that ye delivered me not i put my life in my hands and passed over against the children of ammon and the lord delivered them into my hand wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day to fight against me 124 then jephthah gathered together all the men of gilead and fought with ephraim and the men of gilead smote ephraim because they said ye gileadites are fugitives of ephraim among the ephraimites and among the manassites 125 and the gileadites took the passages of jordan before the ephraimites and it was so that when those ephraimites which were escaped said let me go over that the men of gilead said unto him art thou an ephraimite if he said nay 126 then said they unto him say now shibboleth and he said sibboleth for he could not frame to pronounce it right then they took him and slew him at the passages of jordan and there fell at that time of the ephraimites forty and two thousand 127 and jephthah judged israel six years then died jephthah the gileadite and was buried in one of the cities of gilead 128 and after him ibzan of bethlehem judged israel 129 and he had thirty sons and thirty daughters whom he sent abroad and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons and he judged israel seven years 1210 then died ibzan and was buried at bethlehem 1211 and after him elon a zebulonite judged israel and he judged israel ten years 1212 and elon the zebulonite died and was buried in aijalon in the country of zebulun 1213 and after him abdon the son of hillel a pirathonite judged israel 1214 and he had forty sons and thirty nephews that rode on threescore and ten ass colts and he judged israel eight years 1215 and abdon the son of hillel the pirathonite died and was buried in pirathon in the land of ephraim in the mount of the amalekites 131 and the children of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord and the lord delivered them into the hand of the philistines forty years 132 and there was a certain man of zorah of the family of the danites whose name was manoah and his wife was barren and bare not 133 and the angel of the lord appeared unto the woman and said unto her behold now thou art barren and bearest not but thou shalt conceive and bear a son 134 now therefore beware i pray thee and drink not wine nor strong drink and eat not any unclean thing 135 for lo thou shalt conceive and bear a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a nazarite unto god from the womb and he shall begin to deliver israel out of the hand of the philistines 136 then the woman came and told her husband saying a man of god came unto me and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of god very terrible but i asked him not whence he was neither told he me his name 137 but he said unto me behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son and now drink no wine nor strong drink neither eat any unclean thing for the child shall be a nazarite to god from the womb to the day of his death 138 then manoah intreated the lord and said o my lord let the man of god which thou didst send come again unto us and teach us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born 139 and god hearkened to the voice of manoah and the angel of god came again unto the woman as she sat in the field but manoah her husband was not with her 1310 and the woman made haste and ran and shewed her husband and said unto him behold the man hath appeared unto me that came unto me the other day 1311 and manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said unto him art thou the man that spakest unto the woman and he said i am 1312 and manoah said now let thy words come to pass how shall we order the child and how shall we do unto him 1313 and the angel of the lord said unto manoah of all that i said unto the woman let her beware 1314 she may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine neither let her drink wine or strong drink nor eat any unclean thing all that i commanded her let her observe 1315 and manoah said unto the angel of the lord i pray thee let us detain thee until we shall have made ready a kid for thee 1316 and the angel of the lord said unto manoah though thou detain me i will not eat of thy bread and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering thou must offer it unto the lord for manoah knew not that he was an angel of the lord 1317 and manoah said unto the angel of the lord what is thy name that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour 1318 and the angel of the lord said unto him why askest thou thus after my name seeing it is secret 1319 so manoah took a kid with a meat offering and offered it upon a rock unto the lord and the angel did wonderously and manoah and his wife looked on 1320 for it came to pass when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar that the angel of the lord ascended in the flame of the altar and manoah and his wife looked on it and fell on their faces to the ground 1321 but the angel of the lord did no more appear to manoah and to his wife then manoah knew that he was an angel of the lord 1322 and manoah said unto his wife we shall surely die because we have seen god 1323 but his wife said unto him if the lord were pleased to kill us he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands neither would he have shewed us all these things nor would as at this time have told us such things as these 1324 and the woman bare a son and called his name samson and the child grew and the lord blessed him 1325 and the spirit of the lord began to move him at times in the camp of dan between zorah and eshtaol 141 and samson went down to timnath and saw a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines 142 and he came up and told his father and his mother and said i have seen a woman in timnath of the daughters of the philistines now therefore get her for me to wife 143 then his father and his mother said unto him is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren or among all my people that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised philistines and samson said unto his father get her for me for she pleaseth me well 144 but his father and his mother knew not that it was of the lord that he sought an occasion against the philistines for at that time the philistines had dominion over israel 145 then went samson down and his father and his mother to timnath and came to the vineyards of timnath and behold a young lion roared against him 146 and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and he rent him as he would have rent a kid and he had nothing in his hand but he told not his father or his mother what he had done 147 and he went down and talked with the woman and she pleased samson well 148 and after a time he returned to take her and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion and behold there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion 149 and he took thereof in his hands and went on eating and came to his father and mother and he gave them and they did eat but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion 1410 so his father went down unto the woman and samson made there a feast for so used the young men to do 1411 and it came to pass when they saw him that they brought thirty companions to be with him 1412 and samson said unto them i will now put forth a riddle unto you if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the feast and find it out then i will give you thirty sheets and thirty change of garments 1413 but if ye cannot declare it me then shall ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments and they said unto him put forth thy riddle that we may hear it 1414 and he said unto them out of the eater came forth meat and out of the strong came forth sweetness and they could not in three days expound the riddle 1415 and it came to pass on the seventh day that they said unto samsons wife entice thy husband that he may declare unto us the riddle lest we burn thee and thy fathers house with fire have ye called us to take that we have is it not so 1416 and samsons wife wept before him and said thou dost but hate me and lovest me not thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people and hast not told it me and he said unto her behold i have not told it my father nor my mother and shall i tell it thee 1417 and she wept before him the seven days while their feast lasted and it came to pass on the seventh day that he told her because she lay sore upon him and she told the riddle to the children of her people 1418 and the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down what is sweeter than honey and what is stronger than a lion and he said unto them if ye had not plowed with my heifer ye had not found out my riddle 1419 and the spirit of the lord came upon him and he went down to ashkelon and slew thirty men of them and took their spoil and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle and his anger was kindled and he went up to his fathers house 1420 but samsons wife was given to his companion whom he had used as his friend 151 but it came to pass within a while after in the time of wheat harvest that samson visited his wife with a kid and he said i will go in to my wife into the chamber but her father would not suffer him to go in 152 and her father said i verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her therefore i gave her to thy companion is not her younger sister fairer than she take her i pray thee instead of her 153 and samson said concerning them now shall i be more blameless than the philistines though i do them a displeasure 154 and samson went and caught three hundred foxes and took firebrands and turned tail to tail and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails 155 and when he had set the brands on fire he let them go into the standing corn of the philistines and burnt up both the shocks and also the standing corn with the vineyards and olives 156 then the philistines said who hath done this and they answered samson the son in law of the timnite because he had taken his wife and given her to his companion and the philistines came up and burnt her and her father with fire 157 and samson said unto them though ye have done this yet will i be avenged of you and after that i will cease 158 and he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock etam 159 then the philistines went up and pitched in judah and spread themselves in lehi 1510 and the men of judah said why are ye come up against us and they answered to bind samson are we come up to do to him as he hath done to us 1511 then three thousand men of judah went to the top of the rock etam and said to samson knowest thou not that the philistines are rulers over us what is this that thou hast done unto us and he said unto them as they did unto me so have i done unto them 1512 and they said unto him we are come down to bind thee that we may deliver thee into the hand of the philistines and samson said unto them swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves 1513 and they spake unto him saying no but we will bind thee fast and deliver thee into their hand but surely we will not kill thee and they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from the rock 1514 and when he came unto lehi the philistines shouted against him and the spirit of the lord came mightily upon him and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire and his bands loosed from off his hands 1515 and he found a new jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men therewith 1516 and samson said with the jawbone of an ass heaps upon heaps with the jaw of an ass have i slain a thousand men 1517 and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand and called that place ramathlehi 1518 and he was sore athirst and called on the lord and said thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant and now shall i die for thirst and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised 1519 but god clave an hollow place that was in the jaw and there came water thereout and when he had drunk his spirit came again and he revived wherefore he called the name thereof enhakkore which is in lehi unto this day 1520 and he judged israel in the days of the philistines twenty years 161 then went samson to gaza and saw there an harlot and went in unto her 162 and it was told the gazites saying samson is come hither and they compassed him in and laid wait for him all night in the gate of the city and were quiet all the night saying in the morning when it is day we shall kill him 163 and samson lay till midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts and went away with them bar and all and put them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before hebron 164 and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of sorek whose name was delilah 165 and the lords of the philistines came up unto her and said unto her entice him and see wherein his great strength lieth and by what means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver 166 and delilah said to samson tell me i pray thee wherein thy great strength lieth and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict thee 167 and samson said unto her if they bind me with seven green withs that were never dried then shall i be weak and be as another man 168 then the lords of the philistines brought up to her seven green withs which had not been dried and she bound him with them 169 now there were men lying in wait abiding with her in the chamber and she said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and he brake the withs as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the fire so his strength was not known 1610 and delilah said unto samson behold thou hast mocked me and told me lies now tell me i pray thee wherewith thou mightest be bound 1611 and he said unto her if they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied then shall i be weak and be as another man 1612 delilah therefore took new ropes and bound him therewith and said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and there were liers in wait abiding in the chamber and he brake them from off his arms like a thread 1613 and delilah said unto samson hitherto thou hast mocked me and told me lies tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound and he said unto her if thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web 1614 and she fastened it with the pin and said unto him the philistines be upon thee samson and he awaked out of his sleep and went away with the pin of the beam and with the web 1615 and she said unto him how canst thou say i love thee when thine heart is not with me thou hast mocked me these three times and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth 1616 and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so that his soul was vexed unto death 1617 that he told her all his heart and said unto her there hath not come a razor upon mine head for i have been a nazarite unto god from my mothers womb if i be shaven then my strength will go from me and i shall become weak and be like any other man 1618 and when delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the lords of the philistines saying come up this once for he hath shewed me all his heart then the lords of the philistines came up unto her and brought money in their hand 1619 and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him 1620 and she said the philistines be upon thee samson and he awoke out of his sleep and said i will go out as at other times before and shake myself and he wist not that the lord was departed from him 1621 but the philistines took him and put out his eyes and brought him down to gaza and bound him with fetters of brass and he did grind in the prison house 1622 howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven 1623 then the lords of the philistines gathered them together for to offer a great sacrifice unto dagon their god and to rejoice for they said our god hath delivered samson our enemy into our hand 1624 and when the people saw him they praised their god for they said our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy and the destroyer of our country which slew many of us 1625 and it came to pass when their hearts were merry that they said call for samson that he may make us sport and they called for samson out of the prison house and he made them sport and they set him between the pillars 1626 and samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand suffer me that i may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth that i may lean upon them 1627 now the house was full of men and women and all the lords of the philistines were there and there were upon the roof about three thousand men and women that beheld while samson made sport 1628 and samson called unto the lord and said o lord god remember me i pray thee and strengthen me i pray thee only this once o god that i may be at once avenged of the philistines for my two eyes 1629 and samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was borne up of the one with his right hand and of the other with his left 1630 and samson said let me die with the philistines and he bowed himself with all his might and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were therein so the dead which he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his life 1631 then his brethren and all the house of his father came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between zorah and eshtaol in the buryingplace of manoah his father and he judged israel twenty years 171 and there was a man of mount ephraim whose name was micah 172 and he said unto his mother the eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee about which thou cursedst and spakest of also in mine ears behold the silver is with me i took it and his mother said blessed be thou of the lord my son 173 and when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother his mother said i had wholly dedicated the silver unto the lord from my hand for my son to make a graven image and a molten image now therefore i will restore it unto thee 174 yet he restored the money unto his mother and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the founder who made thereof a graven image and a molten image and they were in the house of micah 175 and the man micah had an house of gods and made an ephod and teraphim and consecrated one of his sons who became his priest 176 in those days there was no king in israel but every man did that which was right in his own eyes 177 and there was a young man out of bethlehemjudah of the family of judah who was a levite and he sojourned there 178 and the man departed out of the city from bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place and he came to mount ephraim to the house of micah as he journeyed 179 and micah said unto him whence comest thou and he said unto him i am a levite of bethlehemjudah and i go to sojourn where i may find a place 1710 and micah said unto him dwell with me and be unto me a father and a priest and i will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year and a suit of apparel and thy victuals so the levite went in 1711 and the levite was content to dwell with the man and the young man was unto him as one of his sons 1712 and micah consecrated the levite and the young man became his priest and was in the house of micah 1713 then said micah now know i that the lord will do me good seeing i have a levite to my priest 181 in those days there was no king in israel and in those days the tribe of the danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the tribes of israel 182 and the children of dan sent of their family five men from their coasts men of valour from zorah and from eshtaol to spy out the land and to search it and they said unto them go search the land who when they came to mount ephraim to the house of micah they lodged there 183 when they were by the house of micah they knew the voice of the young man the levite and they turned in thither and said unto him who brought thee hither and what makest thou in this place and what hast thou here 184 and he said unto them thus and thus dealeth micah with me and hath hired me and i am his priest 185 and they said unto him ask counsel we pray thee of god that we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous 186 and the priest said unto them go in peace before the lord is your way wherein ye go 187 then the five men departed and came to laish and saw the people that were therein how they dwelt careless after the manner of the zidonians quiet and secure and there was no magistrate in the land that might put them to shame in any thing and they were far from the zidonians and had no business with any man 188 and they came unto their brethren to zorah and eshtaol and their brethren said unto them what say ye 189 and they said arise that we may go up against them for we have seen the land and behold it is very good and are ye still be not slothful to go and to enter to possess the land 1810 when ye go ye shall come unto a people secure and to a large land for god hath given it into your hands a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth 1811 and there went from thence of the family of the danites out of zorah and out of eshtaol six hundred men appointed with weapons of war 1812 and they went up and pitched in kirjathjearim in judah wherefore they called that place mahanehdan unto this day behold it is behind kirjathjearim 1813 and they passed thence unto mount ephraim and came unto the house of micah 1814 then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of laish and said unto their brethren do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod and teraphim and a graven image and a molten image now therefore consider what ye have to do 1815 and they turned thitherward and came to the house of the young man the levite even unto the house of micah and saluted him 1816 and the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war which were of the children of dan stood by the entering of the gate 1817 and the five men that went to spy out the land went up and came in thither and took the graven image and the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image and the priest stood in the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons of war 1818 and these went into micahs house and fetched the carved image the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image then said the priest unto them what do ye 1819 and they said unto him hold thy peace lay thine hand upon thy mouth and go with us and be to us a father and a priest is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in israel 1820 and the priests heart was glad and he took the ephod and the teraphim and the graven image and went in the midst of the people 1821 so they turned and departed and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them 1822 and when they were a good way from the house of micah the men that were in the houses near to micahs house were gathered together and overtook the children of dan 1823 and they cried unto the children of dan and they turned their faces and said unto micah what aileth thee that thou comest with such a company 1824 and he said ye have taken away my gods which i made and the priest and ye are gone away and what have i more and what is this that ye say unto me what aileth thee 1825 and the children of dan said unto him let not thy voice be heard among us lest angry fellows run upon thee and thou lose thy life with the lives of thy household 1826 and the children of dan went their way and when micah saw that they were too strong for him he turned and went back unto his house 1827 and they took the things which micah had made and the priest which he had and came unto laish unto a people that were at quiet and secure and they smote them with the edge of the sword and burnt the city with fire 1828 and there was no deliverer because it was far from zidon and they had no business with any man and it was in the valley that lieth by bethrehob and they built a city and dwelt therein 1829 and they called the name of the city dan after the name of dan their father who was born unto israel howbeit the name of the city was laish at the first 1830 and the children of dan set up the graven image and jonathan the son of gershom the son of manasseh he and his sons were priests to the tribe of dan until the day of the captivity of the land 1831 and they set them up micahs graven image which he made all the time that the house of god was in shiloh 191 and it came to pass in those days when there was no king in israel that there was a certain levite sojourning on the side of mount ephraim who took to him a concubine out of bethlehemjudah 192 and his concubine played the whore against him and went away from him unto her fathers house to bethlehemjudah and was there four whole months 193 and her husband arose and went after her to speak friendly unto her and to bring her again having his servant with him and a couple of asses and she brought him into her fathers house and when the father of the damsel saw him he rejoiced to meet him 194 and his father in law the damsels father retained him and he abode with him three days so they did eat and drink and lodged there 195 and it came to pass on the fourth day when they arose early in the morning that he rose up to depart and the damsels father said unto his son in law comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread and afterward go your way 196 and they sat down and did eat and drink both of them together for the damsels father had said unto the man be content i pray thee and tarry all night and let thine heart be merry 197 and when the man rose up to depart his father in law urged him therefore he lodged there again 198 and he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart and the damsels father said comfort thine heart i pray thee and they tarried until afternoon and they did eat both of them 199 and when the man rose up to depart he and his concubine and his servant his father in law the damsels father said unto him behold now the day draweth toward evening i pray you tarry all night behold the day groweth to an end lodge here that thine heart may be merry and to morrow get you early on your way that thou mayest go home 1910 but the man would not tarry that night but he rose up and departed and came over against jebus which is jerusalem and there were with him two asses saddled his concubine also was with him 1911 and when they were by jebus the day was far spent and the servant said unto his master come i pray thee and let us turn in into this city of the jebusites and lodge in it 1912 and his master said unto him we will not turn aside hither into the city of a stranger that is not of the children of israel we will pass over to gibeah 1913 and he said unto his servant come and let us draw near to one of these places to lodge all night in gibeah or in ramah 1914 and they passed on and went their way and the sun went down upon them when they were by gibeah which belongeth to benjamin 1915 and they turned aside thither to go in and to lodge in gibeah and when he went in he sat him down in a street of the city for there was no man that took them into his house to lodging 1916 and behold there came an old man from his work out of the field at even which was also of mount ephraim and he sojourned in gibeah but the men of the place were benjamites 1917 and when he had lifted up his eyes he saw a wayfaring man in the street of the city and the old man said whither goest thou and whence comest thou 1918 and he said unto him we are passing from bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount ephraim from thence am i and i went to bethlehemjudah but i am now going to the house of the lord and there is no man that receiveth me to house 1919 yet there is both straw and provender for our asses and there is bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid and for the young man which is with thy servants there is no want of any thing 1920 and the old man said peace be with thee howsoever let all thy wants lie upon me only lodge not in the street 1921 so he brought him into his house and gave provender unto the asses and they washed their feet and did eat and drink 1922 now as they were making their hearts merry behold the men of the city certain sons of belial beset the house round about and beat at the door and spake to the master of the house the old man saying bring forth the man that came into thine house that we may know him 1923 and the man the master of the house went out unto them and said unto them nay my brethren nay i pray you do not so wickedly seeing that this man is come into mine house do not this folly 1924 behold here is my daughter a maiden and his concubine them i will bring out now and humble ye them and do with them what seemeth good unto you but unto this man do not so vile a thing 1925 but the men would not hearken to him so the man took his concubine and brought her forth unto them and they knew her and abused her all the night until the morning and when the day began to spring they let her go 1926 then came the woman in the dawning of the day and fell down at the door of the mans house where her lord was till it was light 1927 and her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way and behold the woman his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house and her hands were upon the threshold 1928 and he said unto her up and let us be going but none answered then the man took her up upon an ass and the man rose up and gat him unto his place 1929 and when he was come into his house he took a knife and laid hold on his concubine and divided her together with her bones into twelve pieces and sent her into all the coasts of israel 1930 and it was so that all that saw it said there was no such deed done nor seen from the day that the children of israel came up out of the land of egypt unto this day consider of it take advice and speak your minds 201 then all the children of israel went out and the congregation was gathered together as one man from dan even to beersheba with the land of gilead unto the lord in mizpeh 202 and the chief of all the people even of all the tribes of israel presented themselves in the assembly of the people of god four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword 203 now the children of benjamin heard that the children of israel were gone up to mizpeh then said the children of israel tell us how was this wickedness 204 and the levite the husband of the woman that was slain answered and said i came into gibeah that belongeth to benjamin i and my concubine to lodge 205 and the men of gibeah rose against me and beset the house round about upon me by night and thought to have slain me and my concubine have they forced that she is dead 206 and i took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of israel for they have committed lewdness and folly in israel 207 behold ye are all children of israel give here your advice and counsel 208 and all the people arose as one man saying we will not any of us go to his tent neither will we any of us turn into his house 209 but now this shall be the thing which we will do to gibeah we will go up by lot against it 2010 and we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of israel and an hundred of a thousand and a thousand out of ten thousand to fetch victual for the people that they may do when they come to gibeah of benjamin according to all the folly that they have wrought in israel 2011 so all the men of israel were gathered against the city knit together as one man 2012 and the tribes of israel sent men through all the tribe of benjamin saying what wickedness is this that is done among you 2013 now therefore deliver us the men the children of belial which are in gibeah that we may put them to death and put away evil from israel but the children of benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of israel 2014 but the children of benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto gibeah to go out to battle against the children of israel 2015 and the children of benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword beside the inhabitants of gibeah which were numbered seven hundred chosen men 2016 among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded every one could sling stones at an hair breadth and not miss 2017 and the men of israel beside benjamin were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword all these were men of war 2018 and the children of israel arose and went up to the house of god and asked counsel of god and said which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of benjamin and the lord said judah shall go up first 2019 and the children of israel rose up in the morning and encamped against gibeah 2020 and the men of israel went out to battle against benjamin and the men of israel put themselves in array to fight against them at gibeah 2021 and the children of benjamin came forth out of gibeah and destroyed down to the ground of the israelites that day twenty and two thousand men 2022 and the people the men of israel encouraged themselves and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day 2023 and the children of israel went up and wept before the lord until even and asked counsel of the lord saying shall i go up again to battle against the children of benjamin my brother and the lord said go up against him 2024 and the children of israel came near against the children of benjamin the second day 2025 and benjamin went forth against them out of gibeah the second day and destroyed down to the ground of the children of israel again eighteen thousand men all these drew the sword 2026 then all the children of israel and all the people went up and came unto the house of god and wept and sat there before the lord and fasted that day until even and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord 2027 and the children of israel enquired of the lord for the ark of the covenant of god was there in those days 2028 and phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron stood before it in those days saying shall i yet again go out to battle against the children of benjamin my brother or shall i cease and the lord said go up for to morrow i will deliver them into thine hand 2029 and israel set liers in wait round about gibeah 2030 and the children of israel went up against the children of benjamin on the third day and put themselves in array against gibeah as at other times 2031 and the children of benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city and they began to smite of the people and kill as at other times in the highways of which one goeth up to the house of god and the other to gibeah in the field about thirty men of israel 2032 and the children of benjamin said they are smitten down before us as at the first but the children of israel said let us flee and draw them from the city unto the highways 2033 and all the men of israel rose up out of their place and put themselves in array at baaltamar and the liers in wait of israel came forth out of their places even out of the meadows of gibeah 2034 and there came against gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all israel and the battle was sore but they knew not that evil was near them 2035 and the lord smote benjamin before israel and the children of israel destroyed of the benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men all these drew the sword 2036 so the children of benjamin saw that they were smitten for the men of israel gave place to the benjamites because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside gibeah 2037 and the liers in wait hasted and rushed upon gibeah and the liers in wait drew themselves along and smote all the city with the edge of the sword 2038 now there was an appointed sign between the men of israel and the liers in wait that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city 2039 and when the men of israel retired in the battle benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of israel about thirty persons for they said surely they are smitten down before us as in the first battle 2040 but when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke the benjamites looked behind them and behold the flame of the city ascended up to heaven 2041 and when the men of israel turned again the men of benjamin were amazed for they saw that evil was come upon them 2042 therefore they turned their backs before the men of israel unto the way of the wilderness but the battle overtook them and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them 2043 thus they inclosed the benjamites round about and chased them and trode them down with ease over against gibeah toward the sunrising 2044 and there fell of benjamin eighteen thousand men all these were men of valour 2045 and they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of rimmon and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men and pursued hard after them unto gidom and slew two thousand men of them 2046 so that all which fell that day of benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword all these were men of valour 2047 but six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock rimmon and abode in the rock rimmon four months 2048 and the men of israel turned again upon the children of benjamin and smote them with the edge of the sword as well the men of every city as the beast and all that came to hand also they set on fire all the cities that they came to 211 now the men of israel had sworn in mizpeh saying there shall not any of us give his daughter unto benjamin to wife 212 and the people came to the house of god and abode there till even before god and lifted up their voices and wept sore 213 and said o lord god of israel why is this come to pass in israel that there should be to day one tribe lacking in israel 214 and it came to pass on the morrow that the people rose early and built there an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings 215 and the children of israel said who is there among all the tribes of israel that came not up with the congregation unto the lord for they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the lord to mizpeh saying he shall surely be put to death 216 and the children of israel repented them for benjamin their brother and said there is one tribe cut off from israel this day 217 how shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing we have sworn by the lord that we will not give them of our daughters to wives 218 and they said what one is there of the tribes of israel that came not up to mizpeh to the lord and behold there came none to the camp from jabeshgilead to the assembly 219 for the people were numbered and behold there were none of the inhabitants of jabeshgilead there 2110 and the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the valiantest and commanded them saying go and smite the inhabitants of jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword with the women and the children 2111 and this is the thing that ye shall do ye shall utterly destroy every male and every woman that hath lain by man 2112 and they found among the inhabitants of jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any male and they brought them unto the camp to shiloh which is in the land of canaan 2113 and the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of benjamin that were in the rock rimmon and to call peaceably unto them 2114 and benjamin came again at that time and they gave them wives which they had saved alive of the women of jabeshgilead and yet so they sufficed them not 2115 and the people repented them for benjamin because that the lord had made a breach in the tribes of israel 2116 then the elders of the congregation said how shall we do for wives for them that remain seeing the women are destroyed out of benjamin 2117 and they said there must be an inheritance for them that be escaped of benjamin that a tribe be not destroyed out of israel 2118 howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters for the children of israel have sworn saying cursed be he that giveth a wife to benjamin 2119 then they said behold there is a feast of the lord in shiloh yearly in a place which is on the north side of bethel on the east side of the highway that goeth up from bethel to shechem and on the south of lebonah 2120 therefore they commanded the children of benjamin saying go and lie in wait in the vineyards 2121 and see and behold if the daughters of shiloh come out to dance in dances then come ye out of the vineyards and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of shiloh and go to the land of benjamin 2122 and it shall be when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain that we will say unto them be favourable unto them for our sakes because we reserved not to each man his wife in the war for ye did not give unto them at this time that ye should be guilty 2123 and the children of benjamin did so and took them wives according to their number of them that danced whom they caught and they went and returned unto their inheritance and repaired the cities and dwelt in them 2124 and the children of israel departed thence at that time every man to his tribe and to his family and they went out from thence every man to his inheritance 2125 in those days there was no king in israel every man did that which was right in his own eyes the book of ruth 11 now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and a certain man of bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of moab he and his wife and his two sons 12 and the name of the man was elimelech and the name of his wife naomi and the name of his two sons mahlon and chilion ephrathites of bethlehemjudah and they came into the country of moab and continued there 13 and elimelech naomis husband died and she was left and her two sons 14 and they took them wives of the women of moab the name of the one was orpah and the name of the other ruth and they dwelled there about ten years 15 and mahlon and chilion died also both of them and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband 16 then she arose with her daughters in law that she might return from the country of moab for she had heard in the country of moab how that the lord had visited his people in giving them bread 17 wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was and her two daughters in law with her and they went on the way to return unto the land of judah 18 and naomi said unto her two daughters in law go return each to her mothers house the lord deal kindly with you as ye have dealt with the dead and with me 19 the lord grant you that ye may find rest each of you in the house of her husband then she kissed them and they lifted up their voice and wept 110 and they said unto her surely we will return with thee unto thy people 111 and naomi said turn again my daughters why will ye go with me are there yet any more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands 112 turn again my daughters go your way for i am too old to have an husband if i should say i have hope if i should have an husband also to night and should also bear sons 113 would ye tarry for them till they were grown would ye stay for them from having husbands nay my daughters for it grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the lord is gone out against me 114 and they lifted up their voice and wept again and orpah kissed her mother in law but ruth clave unto her 115 and she said behold thy sister in law is gone back unto her people and unto her gods return thou after thy sister in law 116 and ruth said intreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whither thou goest i will go and where thou lodgest i will lodge thy people shall be my people and thy god my god 117 where thou diest will i die and there will i be buried the lord do so to me and more also if ought but death part thee and me 118 when she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her then she left speaking unto her 119 so they two went until they came to bethlehem and it came to pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was moved about them and they said is this naomi 120 and she said unto them call me not naomi call me mara for the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me 121 i went out full and the lord hath brought me home again empty why then call ye me naomi seeing the lord hath testified against me and the almighty hath afflicted me 122 so naomi returned and ruth the moabitess her daughter in law with her which returned out of the country of moab and they came to bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest 21 and naomi had a kinsman of her husbands a mighty man of wealth of the family of elimelech and his name was boaz 22 and ruth the moabitess said unto naomi let me now go to the field and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight i shall find grace and she said unto her go my daughter 23 and she went and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging unto boaz who was of the kindred of elimelech 24 and behold boaz came from bethlehem and said unto the reapers the lord be with you and they answered him the lord bless thee 25 then said boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers whose damsel is this 26 and the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said it is the moabitish damsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab 27 and she said i pray you let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves so she came and hath continued even from the morning until now that she tarried a little in the house 28 then said boaz unto ruth hearest thou not my daughter go not to glean in another field neither go from hence but abide here fast by my maidens 29 let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap and go thou after them have i not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee and when thou art athirst go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn 210 then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him why have i found grace in thine eyes that thou shouldest take knowledge of me seeing i am a stranger 211 and boaz answered and said unto her it hath fully been shewed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine husband and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity and art come unto a people which thou knewest not heretofore 212 the lord recompense thy work and a full reward be given thee of the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust 213 then she said let me find favour in thy sight my lord for that thou hast comforted me and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid though i be not like unto one of thine handmaidens 214 and boaz said unto her at mealtime come thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left 215 and when she was risen up to glean boaz commanded his young men saying let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her not 216 and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not 217 so she gleaned in the field until even and beat out that she had gleaned and it was about an ephah of barley 218 and she took it up and went into the city and her mother in law saw what she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed 219 and her mother in law said unto her where hast thou gleaned to day and where wroughtest thou blessed be he that did take knowledge of thee and she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought and said the mans name with whom i wrought to day is boaz 220 and naomi said unto her daughter in law blessed be he of the lord who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead and naomi said unto her the man is near of kin unto us one of our next kinsmen 221 and ruth the moabitess said he said unto me also thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my harvest 222 and naomi said unto ruth her daughter in law it is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not in any other field 223 so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother in law 31 then naomi her mother in law said unto her my daughter shall i not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee 32 and now is not boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou wast behold he winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor 33 wash thyself therefore and anoint thee and put thy raiment upon thee and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking 34 and it shall be when he lieth down that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what thou shalt do 35 and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me i will do 36 and she went down unto the floor and did according to all that her mother in law bade her 37 and when boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn and she came softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down 38 and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet 39 and he said who art thou and she answered i am ruth thine handmaid spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid for thou art a near kinsman 310 and he said blessed be thou of the lord my daughter for thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning inasmuch as thou followedst not young men whether poor or rich 311 and now my daughter fear not i will do to thee all that thou requirest for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman 312 and now it is true that i am thy near kinsman howbeit there is a kinsman nearer than i 313 tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman well let him do the kinsmans part but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee then will i do the part of a kinsman to thee as the lord liveth lie down until the morning 314 and she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came into the floor 315 also he said bring the vail that thou hast upon thee and hold it and when she held it he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her and she went into the city 316 and when she came to her mother in law she said who art thou my daughter and she told her all that the man had done to her 317 and she said these six measures of barley gave he me for he said to me go not empty unto thy mother in law 318 then said she sit still my daughter until thou know how the matter will fall for the man will not be in rest until he have finished the thing this day 41 then went boaz up to the gate and sat him down there and behold the kinsman of whom boaz spake came by unto whom he said ho such a one turn aside sit down here and he turned aside and sat down 42 and he took ten men of the elders of the city and said sit ye down here and they sat down 43 and he said unto the kinsman naomi that is come again out of the country of moab selleth a parcel of land which was our brother elimelechs 44 and i thought to advertise thee saying buy it before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people if thou wilt redeem it redeem it but if thou wilt not redeem it then tell me that i may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and i am after thee and he said i will redeem it 45 then said boaz what day thou buyest the field of the hand of naomi thou must buy it also of ruth the moabitess the wife of the dead to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance 46 and the kinsman said i cannot redeem it for myself lest i mar mine own inheritance redeem thou my right to thyself for i cannot redeem it 47 now this was the manner in former time in israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing for to confirm all things a man plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour and this was a testimony in israel 48 therefore the kinsman said unto boaz buy it for thee so he drew off his shoe 49 and boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people ye are witnesses this day that i have bought all that was elimelechs and all that was chilions and mahlons of the hand of naomi 410 moreover ruth the moabitess the wife of mahlon have i purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place ye are witnesses this day 411 and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we are witnesses the lord make the woman that is come into thine house like rachel and like leah which two did build the house of israel and do thou worthily in ephratah and be famous in bethlehem 412 and let thy house be like the house of pharez whom tamar bare unto judah of the seed which the lord shall give thee of this young woman 413 so boaz took ruth and she was his wife and when he went in unto her the lord gave her conception and she bare a son 414 and the women said unto naomi blessed be the lord which hath not left thee this day without a kinsman that his name may be famous in israel 415 and he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life and a nourisher of thine old age for thy daughter in law which loveth thee which is better to thee than seven sons hath born him 416 and naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and became nurse unto it 417 and the women her neighbours gave it a name saying there is a son born to naomi and they called his name obed he is the father of jesse the father of david 418 now these are the generations of pharez pharez begat hezron 419 and hezron begat ram and ram begat amminadab 420 and amminadab begat nahshon and nahshon begat salmon 421 and salmon begat boaz and boaz begat obed 422 and obed begat jesse and jesse begat david the first book of samuel otherwise called the first book of the kings 11 now there was a certain man of ramathaimzophim of mount ephraim and his name was elkanah the son of jeroham the son of elihu the son of tohu the son of zuph an ephrathite 12 and he had two wives the name of the one was hannah and the name of the other peninnah and peninnah had children but hannah had no children 13 and this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the lord of hosts in shiloh and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas the priests of the lord were there 14 and when the time was that elkanah offered he gave to peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters portions 15 but unto hannah he gave a worthy portion for he loved hannah but the lord had shut up her womb 16 and her adversary also provoked her sore for to make her fret because the lord had shut up her womb 17 and as he did so year by year when she went up to the house of the lord so she provoked her therefore she wept and did not eat 18 then said elkanah her husband to her hannah why weepest thou and why eatest thou not and why is thy heart grieved am not i better to thee than ten sons 19 so hannah rose up after they had eaten in shiloh and after they had drunk now eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the lord 110 and she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the lord and wept sore 111 and she vowed a vow and said o lord of hosts if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid and remember me and not forget thine handmaid but wilt give unto thine handmaid a man child then i will give him unto the lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come upon his head 112 and it came to pass as she continued praying before the lord that eli marked her mouth 113 now hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore eli thought she had been drunken 114 and eli said unto her how long wilt thou be drunken put away thy wine from thee 115 and hannah answered and said no my lord i am a woman of a sorrowful spirit i have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the lord 116 count not thine handmaid for a daughter of belial for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have i spoken hitherto 117 then eli answered and said go in peace and the god of israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him 118 and she said let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight so the woman went her way and did eat and her countenance was no more sad 119 and they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the lord and returned and came to their house to ramah and elkanah knew hannah his wife and the lord remembered her 120 wherefore it came to pass when the time was come about after hannah had conceived that she bare a son and called his name samuel saying because i have asked him of the lord 121 and the man elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the lord the yearly sacrifice and his vow 122 but hannah went not up for she said unto her husband i will not go up until the child be weaned and then i will bring him that he may appear before the lord and there abide for ever 123 and elkanah her husband said unto her do what seemeth thee good tarry until thou have weaned him only the lord establish his word so the woman abode and gave her son suck until she weaned him 124 and when she had weaned him she took him up with her with three bullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine and brought him unto the house of the lord in shiloh and the child was young 125 and they slew a bullock and brought the child to eli 126 and she said oh my lord as thy soul liveth my lord i am the woman that stood by thee here praying unto the lord 127 for this child i prayed and the lord hath given me my petition which i asked of him 128 therefore also i have lent him to the lord as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the lord and he worshipped the lord there 21 and hannah prayed and said my heart rejoiceth in the lord mine horn is exalted in the lord my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies because i rejoice in thy salvation 22 there is none holy as the lord for there is none beside thee neither is there any rock like our god 23 talk no more so exceeding proudly let not arrogancy come out of your mouth for the lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are weighed 24 the bows of the mighty men are broken and they that stumbled are girded with strength 25 they that were full have hired out themselves for bread and they that were hungry ceased so that the barren hath born seven and she that hath many children is waxed feeble 26 the lord killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up 27 the lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth low and lifteth up 28 he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill to set them among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory for the pillars of the earth are the lords and he hath set the world upon them 29 he will keep the feet of his saints and the wicked shall be silent in darkness for by strength shall no man prevail 210 the adversaries of the lord shall be broken to pieces out of heaven shall he thunder upon them the lord shall judge the ends of the earth and he shall give strength unto his king and exalt the horn of his anointed 211 and elkanah went to ramah to his house and the child did minister unto the lord before eli the priest 212 now the sons of eli were sons of belial they knew not the lord 213 and the priests custom with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice the priests servant came while the flesh was in seething with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand 214 and he struck it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself so they did in shiloh unto all the israelites that came thither 215 also before they burnt the fat the priests servant came and said to the man that sacrificed give flesh to roast for the priest for he will not have sodden flesh of thee but raw 216 and if any man said unto him let them not fail to burn the fat presently and then take as much as thy soul desireth then he would answer him nay but thou shalt give it me now and if not i will take it by force 217 wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the lord for men abhorred the offering of the lord 218 but samuel ministered before the lord being a child girded with a linen ephod 219 moreover his mother made him a little coat and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice 220 and eli blessed elkanah and his wife and said the lord give thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the lord and they went unto their own home 221 and the lord visited hannah so that she conceived and bare three sons and two daughters and the child samuel grew before the lord 222 now eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto all israel and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation 223 and he said unto them why do ye such things for i hear of your evil dealings by all this people 224 nay my sons for it is no good report that i hear ye make the lords people to transgress 225 if one man sin against another the judge shall judge him but if a man sin against the lord who shall intreat for him notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father because the lord would slay them 226 and the child samuel grew on and was in favour both with the lord and also with men 227 and there came a man of god unto eli and said unto him thus saith the lord did i plainly appear unto the house of thy father when they were in egypt in pharaohs house 228 and did i choose him out of all the tribes of israel to be my priest to offer upon mine altar to burn incense to wear an ephod before me and did i give unto the house of thy father all the offerings made by fire of the children of israel 229 wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering which i have commanded in my habitation and honourest thy sons above me to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of israel my people 230 wherefore the lord god of israel saith i said indeed that thy house and the house of thy father should walk before me for ever but now the lord saith be it far from me for them that honour me i will honour and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed 231 behold the days come that i will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy fathers house that there shall not be an old man in thine house 232 and thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation in all the wealth which god shall give israel and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever 233 and the man of thine whom i shall not cut off from mine altar shall be to consume thine eyes and to grieve thine heart and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age 234 and this shall be a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two sons on hophni and phinehas in one day they shall die both of them 235 and i will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind and i will build him a sure house and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever 236 and it shall come to pass that every one that is left in thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread and shall say put me i pray thee into one of the priests offices that i may eat a piece of bread 31 and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision 32 and it came to pass at that time when eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to wax dim that he could not see 33 and ere the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord where the ark of god was and samuel was laid down to sleep 34 that the lord called samuel and he answered here am i 35 and he ran unto eli and said here am i for thou calledst me and he said i called not lie down again and he went and lay down 36 and the lord called yet again samuel and samuel arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and he answered i called not my son lie down again 37 now samuel did not yet know the lord neither was the word of the lord yet revealed unto him 38 and the lord called samuel again the third time and he arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and eli perceived that the lord had called the child 39 therefore eli said unto samuel go lie down and it shall be if he call thee that thou shalt say speak lord for thy servant heareth so samuel went and lay down in his place 310 and the lord came and stood and called as at other times samuel samuel then samuel answered speak for thy servant heareth 311 and the lord said to samuel behold i will do a thing in israel at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle 312 in that day i will perform against eli all things which i have spoken concerning his house when i begin i will also make an end 313 for i have told him that i will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not 314 and therefore i have sworn unto the house of eli that the iniquity of elis house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever 315 and samuel lay until the morning and opened the doors of the house of the lord and samuel feared to shew eli the vision 316 then eli called samuel and said samuel my son and he answered here am i 317 and he said what is the thing that the lord hath said unto thee i pray thee hide it not from me god do so to thee and more also if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee 318 and samuel told him every whit and hid nothing from him and he said it is the lord let him do what seemeth him good 319 and samuel grew and the lord was with him and did let none of his words fall to the ground 320 and all israel from dan even to beersheba knew that samuel was established to be a prophet of the lord 321 and the lord appeared again in shiloh for the lord revealed himself to samuel in shiloh by the word of the lord 41 and the word of samuel came to all israel now israel went out against the philistines to battle and pitched beside ebenezer and the philistines pitched in aphek 42 and the philistines put themselves in array against israel and when they joined battle israel was smitten before the philistines and they slew of the army in the field about four thousand men 43 and when the people were come into the camp the elders of israel said wherefore hath the lord smitten us to day before the philistines let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the lord out of shiloh unto us that when it cometh among us it may save us out of the hand of our enemies 44 so the people sent to shiloh that they might bring from thence the ark of the covenant of the lord of hosts which dwelleth between the cherubims and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were there with the ark of the covenant of god 45 and when the ark of the covenant of the lord came into the camp all israel shouted with a great shout so that the earth rang again 46 and when the philistines heard the noise of the shout they said what meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp of the hebrews and they understood that the ark of the lord was come into the camp 47 and the philistines were afraid for they said god is come into the camp and they said woe unto us for there hath not been such a thing heretofore 48 woe unto us who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods these are the gods that smote the egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness 49 be strong and quit yourselves like men o ye philistines that ye be not servants unto the hebrews as they have been to you quit yourselves like men and fight 410 and the philistines fought and israel was smitten and they fled every man into his tent and there was a very great slaughter for there fell of israel thirty thousand footmen 411 and the ark of god was taken and the two sons of eli hophni and phinehas were slain 412 and there ran a man of benjamin out of the army and came to shiloh the same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head 413 and when he came lo eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching for his heart trembled for the ark of god and when the man came into the city and told it all the city cried out 414 and when eli heard the noise of the crying he said what meaneth the noise of this tumult and the man came in hastily and told eli 415 now eli was ninety and eight years old and his eyes were dim that he could not see 416 and the man said unto eli i am he that came out of the army and i fled to day out of the army and he said what is there done my son 417 and the messenger answered and said israel is fled before the philistines and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people and thy two sons also hophni and phinehas are dead and the ark of god is taken 418 and it came to pass when he made mention of the ark of god that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate and his neck brake and he died for he was an old man and heavy and he had judged israel forty years 419 and his daughter in law phinehas wife was with child near to be delivered and when she heard the tidings that the ark of god was taken and that her father in law and her husband were dead she bowed herself and travailed for her pains came upon her 420 and about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her fear not for thou hast born a son but she answered not neither did she regard it 421 and she named the child ichabod saying the glory is departed from israel because the ark of god was taken and because of her father in law and her husband 422 and she said the glory is departed from israel for the ark of god is taken 51 and the philistines took the ark of god and brought it from ebenezer unto ashdod 52 when the philistines took the ark of god they brought it into the house of dagon and set it by dagon 53 and when they of ashdod arose early on the morrow behold dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the lord and they took dagon and set him in his place again 54 and when they arose early on the morrow morning behold dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the lord and the head of dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off upon the threshold only the stump of dagon was left to him 55 therefore neither the priests of dagon nor any that come into dagons house tread on the threshold of dagon in ashdod unto this day 56 but the hand of the lord was heavy upon them of ashdod and he destroyed them and smote them with emerods even ashdod and the coasts thereof 57 and when the men of ashdod saw that it was so they said the ark of the god of israel shall not abide with us for his hand is sore upon us and upon dagon our god 58 they sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the philistines unto them and said what shall we do with the ark of the god of israel and they answered let the ark of the god of israel be carried about unto gath and they carried the ark of the god of israel about thither 59 and it was so that after they had carried it about the hand of the lord was against the city with a very great destruction and he smote the men of the city both small and great and they had emerods in their secret parts 510 therefore they sent the ark of god to ekron and it came to pass as the ark of god came to ekron that the ekronites cried out saying they have brought about the ark of the god of israel to us to slay us and our people 511 so they sent and gathered together all the lords of the philistines and said send away the ark of the god of israel and let it go again to his own place that it slay us not and our people for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city the hand of god was very heavy there 512 and the men that died not were smitten with the emerods and the cry of the city went up to heaven 61 and the ark of the lord was in the country of the philistines seven months 62 and the philistines called for the priests and the diviners saying what shall we do to the ark of the lord tell us wherewith we shall send it to his place 63 and they said if ye send away the ark of the god of israel send it not empty but in any wise return him a trespass offering then ye shall be healed and it shall be known to you why his hand is not removed from you 64 then said they what shall be the trespass offering which we shall return to him they answered five golden emerods and five golden mice according to the number of the lords of the philistines for one plague was on you all and on your lords 65 wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods and images of your mice that mar the land and ye shall give glory unto the god of israel peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you and from off your gods and from off your land 66 wherefore then do ye harden your hearts as the egyptians and pharaoh hardened their hearts when he had wrought wonderfully among them did they not let the people go and they departed 67 now therefore make a new cart and take two milch kine on which there hath come no yoke and tie the kine to the cart and bring their calves home from them 68 and take the ark of the lord and lay it upon the cart and put the jewels of gold which ye return him for a trespass offering in a coffer by the side thereof and send it away that it may go 69 and see if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to bethshemesh then he hath done us this great evil but if not then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us it was a chance that happened to us 610 and the men did so and took two milch kine and tied them to the cart and shut up their calves at home 611 and they laid the ark of the lord upon the cart and the coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods 612 and the kine took the straight way to the way of bethshemesh and went along the highway lowing as they went and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left and the lords of the philistines went after them unto the border of bethshemesh 613 and they of bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced to see it 614 and the cart came into the field of joshua a bethshemite and stood there where there was a great stone and they clave the wood of the cart and offered the kine a burnt offering unto the lord 615 and the levites took down the ark of the lord and the coffer that was with it wherein the jewels of gold were and put them on the great stone and the men of bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the lord 616 and when the five lords of the philistines had seen it they returned to ekron the same day 617 and these are the golden emerods which the philistines returned for a trespass offering unto the lord for ashdod one for gaza one for askelon one for gath one for ekron one 618 and the golden mice according to the number of all the cities of the philistines belonging to the five lords both of fenced cities and of country villages even unto the great stone of abel whereon they set down the ark of the lord which stone remaineth unto this day in the field of joshua the bethshemite 619 and he smote the men of bethshemesh because they had looked into the ark of the lord even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and ten men and the people lamented because the lord had smitten many of the people with a great slaughter 620 and the men of bethshemesh said who is able to stand before this holy lord god and to whom shall he go up from us 621 and they sent messengers to the inhabitants of kirjathjearim saying the philistines have brought again the ark of the lord come ye down and fetch it up to you 71 and the men of kirjathjearim came and fetched up the ark of the lord and brought it into the house of abinadab in the hill and sanctified eleazar his son to keep the ark of the lord 72 and it came to pass while the ark abode in kirjathjearim that the time was long for it was twenty years and all the house of israel lamented after the lord 73 and samuel spake unto all the house of israel saying if ye do return unto the lord with all your hearts then put away the strange gods and ashtaroth from among you and prepare your hearts unto the lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistines 74 then the children of israel did put away baalim and ashtaroth and served the lord only 75 and samuel said gather all israel to mizpeh and i will pray for you unto the lord 76 and they gathered together to mizpeh and drew water and poured it out before the lord and fasted on that day and said there we have sinned against the lord and samuel judged the children of israel in mizpeh 77 and when the philistines heard that the children of israel were gathered together to mizpeh the lords of the philistines went up against israel and when the children of israel heard it they were afraid of the philistines 78 and the children of israel said to samuel cease not to cry unto the lord our god for us that he will save us out of the hand of the philistines 79 and samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a burnt offering wholly unto the lord and samuel cried unto the lord for israel and the lord heard him 710 and as samuel was offering up the burnt offering the philistines drew near to battle against israel but the lord thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the philistines and discomfited them and they were smitten before israel 711 and the men of israel went out of mizpeh and pursued the philistines and smote them until they came under bethcar 712 then samuel took a stone and set it between mizpeh and shen and called the name of it ebenezer saying hitherto hath the lord helped us 713 so the philistines were subdued and they came no more into the coast of israel and the hand of the lord was against the philistines all the days of samuel 714 and the cities which the philistines had taken from israel were restored to israel from ekron even unto gath and the coasts thereof did israel deliver out of the hands of the philistines and there was peace between israel and the amorites 715 and samuel judged israel all the days of his life 716 and he went from year to year in circuit to bethel and gilgal and mizpeh and judged israel in all those places 717 and his return was to ramah for there was his house and there he judged israel and there he built an altar unto the lord 81 and it came to pass when samuel was old that he made his sons judges over israel 82 now the name of his firstborn was joel and the name of his second abiah they were judges in beersheba 83 and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after lucre and took bribes and perverted judgment 84 then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together and came to samuel unto ramah 85 and said unto him behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations 86 but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and samuel prayed unto the lord 87 and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them 88 according to all the works which they have done since the day that i brought them up out of egypt even unto this day wherewith they have forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee 89 now therefore hearken unto their voice howbeit yet protest solemnly unto them and shew them the manner of the king that shall reign over them 810 and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that asked of him a king 811 and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his chariots 812 and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over fifties and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his instruments of war and instruments of his chariots 813 and he will take your daughters to be confectionaries and to be cooks and to be bakers 814 and he will take your fields and your vineyards and your oliveyards even the best of them and give them to his servants 815 and he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards and give to his officers and to his servants 816 and he will take your menservants and your maidservants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work 817 he will take the tenth of your sheep and ye shall be his servants 818 and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you and the lord will not hear you in that day 819 nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us 820 that we also may be like all the nations and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles 821 and samuel heard all the words of the people and he rehearsed them in the ears of the lord 822 and the lord said to samuel hearken unto their voice and make them a king and samuel said unto the men of israel go ye every man unto his city 91 now there was a man of benjamin whose name was kish the son of abiel the son of zeror the son of bechorath the son of aphiah a benjamite a mighty man of power 92 and he had a son whose name was saul a choice young man and a goodly and there was not among the children of israel a goodlier person than he from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people 93 and the asses of kish sauls father were lost and kish said to saul his son take now one of the servants with thee and arise go seek the asses 94 and he passed through mount ephraim and passed through the land of shalisha but they found them not then they passed through the land of shalim and there they were not and he passed through the land of the benjamites but they found them not 95 and when they were come to the land of zuph saul said to his servant that was with him come and let us return lest my father leave caring for the asses and take thought for us 96 and he said unto him behold now there is in this city a man of god and he is an honourable man all that he saith cometh surely to pass now let us go thither peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go 97 then said saul to his servant but behold if we go what shall we bring the man for the bread is spent in our vessels and there is not a present to bring to the man of god what have we 98 and the servant answered saul again and said behold i have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver that will i give to the man of god to tell us our way 99 beforetime in israel when a man went to enquire of god thus he spake come and let us go to the seer for he that is now called a prophet was beforetime called a seer 910 then said saul to his servant well said come let us go so they went unto the city where the man of god was 911 and as they went up the hill to the city they found young maidens going out to draw water and said unto them is the seer here 912 and they answered them and said he is behold he is before you make haste now for he came to day to the city for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place 913 as soon as ye be come into the city ye shall straightway find him before he go up to the high place to eat for the people will not eat until he come because he doth bless the sacrifice and afterwards they eat that be bidden now therefore get you up for about this time ye shall find him 914 and they went up into the city and when they were come into the city behold samuel came out against them for to go up to the high place 915 now the lord had told samuel in his ear a day before saul came saying 916 to morrow about this time i will send thee a man out of the land of benjamin and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the philistines for i have looked upon my people because their cry is come unto me 917 and when samuel saw saul the lord said unto him behold the man whom i spake to thee of this same shall reign over my people 918 then saul drew near to samuel in the gate and said tell me i pray thee where the seers house is 919 and samuel answered saul and said i am the seer go up before me unto the high place for ye shall eat with me to day and to morrow i will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thine heart 920 and as for thine asses that were lost three days ago set not thy mind on them for they are found and on whom is all the desire of israel is it not on thee and on all thy fathers house 921 and saul answered and said am not i a benjamite of the smallest of the tribes of israel and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of benjamin wherefore then speakest thou so to me 922 and samuel took saul and his servant and brought them into the parlour and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden which were about thirty persons 923 and samuel said unto the cook bring the portion which i gave thee of which i said unto thee set it by thee 924 and the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon it and set it before saul and samuel said behold that which is left set it before thee and eat for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since i said i have invited the people so saul did eat with samuel that day 925 and when they were come down from the high place into the city samuel communed with saul upon the top of the house 926 and they arose early and it came to pass about the spring of the day that samuel called saul to the top of the house saying up that i may send thee away and saul arose and they went out both of them he and samuel abroad 927 and as they were going down to the end of the city samuel said to saul bid the servant pass on before us and he passed on but stand thou still a while that i may shew thee the word of god 101 then samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him and said is it not because the lord hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance 102 when thou art departed from me to day then thou shalt find two men by rachels sepulchre in the border of benjamin at zelzah and they will say unto thee the asses which thou wentest to seek are found and lo thy father hath left the care of the asses and sorroweth for you saying what shall i do for my son 103 then shalt thou go on forward from thence and thou shalt come to the plain of tabor and there shall meet thee three men going up to god to bethel one carrying three kids and another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine 104 and they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread which thou shalt receive of their hands 105 after that thou shalt come to the hill of god where is the garrison of the philistines and it shall come to pass when thou art come thither to the city that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a tabret and a pipe and a harp before them and they shall prophesy 106 and the spirit of the lord will come upon thee and thou shalt prophesy with them and shalt be turned into another man 107 and let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou do as occasion serve thee for god is with thee 108 and thou shalt go down before me to gilgal and behold i will come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings seven days shalt thou tarry till i come to thee and shew thee what thou shalt do 109 and it was so that when he had turned his back to go from samuel god gave him another heart and all those signs came to pass that day 1010 and when they came thither to the hill behold a company of prophets met him and the spirit of god came upon him and he prophesied among them 1011 and it came to pass when all that knew him beforetime saw that behold he prophesied among the prophets then the people said one to another what is this that is come unto the son of kish is saul also among the prophets 1012 and one of the same place answered and said but who is their father therefore it became a proverb is saul also among the prophets 1013 and when he had made an end of prophesying he came to the high place 1014 and sauls uncle said unto him and to his servant whither went ye and he said to seek the asses and when we saw that they were no where we came to samuel 1015 and sauls uncle said tell me i pray thee what samuel said unto you 1016 and saul said unto his uncle he told us plainly that the asses were found but of the matter of the kingdom whereof samuel spake he told him not 1017 and samuel called the people together unto the lord to mizpeh 1018 and said unto the children of israel thus saith the lord god of israel i brought up israel out of egypt and delivered you out of the hand of the egyptians and out of the hand of all kingdoms and of them that oppressed you 1019 and ye have this day rejected your god who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations and ye have said unto him nay but set a king over us now therefore present yourselves before the lord by your tribes and by your thousands 1020 and when samuel had caused all the tribes of israel to come near the tribe of benjamin was taken 1021 when he had caused the tribe of benjamin to come near by their families the family of matri was taken and saul the son of kish was taken and when they sought him he could not be found 1022 therefore they enquired of the lord further if the man should yet come thither and the lord answered behold he hath hid himself among the stuff 1023 and they ran and fetched him thence and when he stood among the people he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward 1024 and samuel said to all the people see ye him whom the lord hath chosen that there is none like him among all the people and all the people shouted and said god save the king 1025 then samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the lord and samuel sent all the people away every man to his house 1026 and saul also went home to gibeah and there went with him a band of men whose hearts god had touched 1027 but the children of belial said how shall this man save us and they despised him and brought no presents but he held his peace 111 then nahash the ammonite came up and encamped against jabeshgilead and all the men of jabesh said unto nahash make a covenant with us and we will serve thee 112 and nahash the ammonite answered them on this condition will i make a covenant with you that i may thrust out all your right eyes and lay it for a reproach upon all israel 113 and the elders of jabesh said unto him give us seven days respite that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of israel and then if there be no man to save us we will come out to thee 114 then came the messengers to gibeah of saul and told the tidings in the ears of the people and all the people lifted up their voices and wept 115 and behold saul came after the herd out of the field and saul said what aileth the people that they weep and they told him the tidings of the men of jabesh 116 and the spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tidings and his anger was kindled greatly 117 and he took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent them throughout all the coasts of israel by the hands of messengers saying whosoever cometh not forth after saul and after samuel so shall it be done unto his oxen and the fear of the lord fell on the people and they came out with one consent 118 and when he numbered them in bezek the children of israel were three hundred thousand and the men of judah thirty thousand 119 and they said unto the messengers that came thus shall ye say unto the men of jabeshgilead to morrow by that time the sun be hot ye shall have help and the messengers came and shewed it to the men of jabesh and they were glad 1110 therefore the men of jabesh said to morrow we will come out unto you and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto you 1111 and it was so on the morrow that saul put the people in three companies and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch and slew the ammonites until the heat of the day and it came to pass that they which remained were scattered so that two of them were not left together 1112 and the people said unto samuel who is he that said shall saul reign over us bring the men that we may put them to death 1113 and saul said there shall not a man be put to death this day for to day the lord hath wrought salvation in israel 1114 then said samuel to the people come and let us go to gilgal and renew the kingdom there 1115 and all the people went to gilgal and there they made saul king before the lord in gilgal and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the lord and there saul and all the men of israel rejoiced greatly 121 and samuel said unto all israel behold i have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over you 122 and now behold the king walketh before you and i am old and grayheaded and behold my sons are with you and i have walked before you from my childhood unto this day 123 behold here i am witness against me before the lord and before his anointed whose ox have i taken or whose ass have i taken or whom have i defrauded whom have i oppressed or of whose hand have i received any bribe to blind mine eyes therewith and i will restore it you 124 and they said thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us neither hast thou taken ought of any mans hand 125 and he said unto them the lord is witness against you and his anointed is witness this day that ye have not found ought in my hand and they answered he is witness 126 and samuel said unto the people it is the lord that advanced moses and aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of egypt 127 now therefore stand still that i may reason with you before the lord of all the righteous acts of the lord which he did to you and to your fathers 128 when jacob was come into egypt and your fathers cried unto the lord then the lord sent moses and aaron which brought forth your fathers out of egypt and made them dwell in this place 129 and when they forgat the lord their god he sold them into the hand of sisera captain of the host of hazor and into the hand of the philistines and into the hand of the king of moab and they fought against them 1210 and they cried unto the lord and said we have sinned because we have forsaken the lord and have served baalim and ashtaroth but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee 1211 and the lord sent jerubbaal and bedan and jephthah and samuel and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side and ye dwelled safe 1212 and when ye saw that nahash the king of the children of ammon came against you ye said unto me nay but a king shall reign over us when the lord your god was your king 1213 now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye have desired and behold the lord hath set a king over you 1214 if ye will fear the lord and serve him and obey his voice and not rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the lord your god 1215 but if ye will not obey the voice of the lord but rebel against the commandment of the lord then shall the hand of the lord be against you as it was against your fathers 1216 now therefore stand and see this great thing which the lord will do before your eyes 1217 is it not wheat harvest to day i will call unto the lord and he shall send thunder and rain that ye may perceive and see that your wickedness is great which ye have done in the sight of the lord in asking you a king 1218 so samuel called unto the lord and the lord sent thunder and rain that day and all the people greatly feared the lord and samuel 1219 and all the people said unto samuel pray for thy servants unto the lord thy god that we die not for we have added unto all our sins this evil to ask us a king 1220 and samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this wickedness yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve the lord with all your heart 1221 and turn ye not aside for then should ye go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain 1222 for the lord will not forsake his people for his great names sake because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people 1223 moreover as for me god forbid that i should sin against the lord in ceasing to pray for you but i will teach you the good and the right way 1224 only fear the lord and serve him in truth with all your heart for consider how great things he hath done for you 1225 but if ye shall still do wickedly ye shall be consumed both ye and your king 131 saul reigned one year and when he had reigned two years over israel 132 saul chose him three thousand men of israel whereof two thousand were with saul in michmash and in mount bethel and a thousand were with jonathan in gibeah of benjamin and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent 133 and jonathan smote the garrison of the philistines that was in geba and the philistines heard of it and saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land saying let the hebrews hear 134 and all israel heard say that saul had smitten a garrison of the philistines and that israel also was had in abomination with the philistines and the people were called together after saul to gilgal 135 and the philistines gathered themselves together to fight with israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude and they came up and pitched in michmash eastward from bethaven 136 when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait for the people were distressed then the people did hide themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits 137 and some of the hebrews went over jordan to the land of gad and gilead as for saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followed him trembling 138 and he tarried seven days according to the set time that samuel had appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him 139 and saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings and he offered the burnt offering 1310 and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering behold samuel came and saul went out to meet him that he might salute him 1311 and samuel said what hast thou done and saul said because i saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not within the days appointed and that the philistines gathered themselves together at michmash 1312 therefore said i the philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal and i have not made supplication unto the lord i forced myself therefore and offered a burnt offering 1313 and samuel said to saul thou hast done foolishly thou hast not kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel for ever 1314 but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord hath sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people because thou hast not kept that which the lord commanded thee 1315 and samuel arose and gat him up from gilgal unto gibeah of benjamin and saul numbered the people that were present with him about six hundred men 1316 and saul and jonathan his son and the people that were present with them abode in gibeah of benjamin but the philistines encamped in michmash 1317 and the spoilers came out of the camp of the philistines in three companies one company turned unto the way that leadeth to ophrah unto the land of shual 1318 and another company turned the way to bethhoron and another company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the valley of zeboim toward the wilderness 1319 now there was no smith found throughout all the land of israel for the philistines said lest the hebrews make them swords or spears 1320 but all the israelites went down to the philistines to sharpen every man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattock 1321 yet they had a file for the mattocks and for the coulters and for the forks and for the axes and to sharpen the goads 1322 so it came to pass in the day of battle that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with saul and jonathan but with saul and with jonathan his son was there found 1323 and the garrison of the philistines went out to the passage of michmash 141 now it came to pass upon a day that jonathan the son of saul said unto the young man that bare his armour come and let us go over to the philistines garrison that is on the other side but he told not his father 142 and saul tarried in the uttermost part of gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in migron and the people that were with him were about six hundred men 143 and ahiah the son of ahitub ichabods brother the son of phinehas the son of eli the lords priest in shiloh wearing an ephod and the people knew not that jonathan was gone 144 and between the passages by which jonathan sought to go over unto the philistines garrison there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side and the name of the one was bozez and the name of the other seneh 145 the forefront of the one was situate northward over against michmash and the other southward over against gibeah 146 and jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised it may be that the lord will work for us for there is no restraint to the lord to save by many or by few 147 and his armourbearer said unto him do all that is in thine heart turn thee behold i am with thee according to thy heart 148 then said jonathan behold we will pass over unto these men and we will discover ourselves unto them 149 if they say thus unto us tarry until we come to you then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them 1410 but if they say thus come up unto us then we will go up for the lord hath delivered them into our hand and this shall be a sign unto us 1411 and both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the philistines and the philistines said behold the hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves 1412 and the men of the garrison answered jonathan and his armourbearer and said come up to us and we will shew you a thing and jonathan said unto his armourbearer come up after me for the lord hath delivered them into the hand of israel 1413 and jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and his armourbearer after him and they fell before jonathan and his armourbearer slew after him 1414 and that first slaughter which jonathan and his armourbearer made was about twenty men within as it were an half acre of land which a yoke of oxen might plow 1415 and there was trembling in the host in the field and among all the people the garrison and the spoilers they also trembled and the earth quaked so it was a very great trembling 1416 and the watchmen of saul in gibeah of benjamin looked and behold the multitude melted away and they went on beating down one another 1417 then said saul unto the people that were with him number now and see who is gone from us and when they had numbered behold jonathan and his armourbearer were not there 1418 and saul said unto ahiah bring hither the ark of god for the ark of god was at that time with the children of israel 1419 and it came to pass while saul talked unto the priest that the noise that was in the host of the philistines went on and increased and saul said unto the priest withdraw thine hand 1420 and saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves and they came to the battle and behold every mans sword was against his fellow and there was a very great discomfiture 1421 moreover the hebrews that were with the philistines before that time which went up with them into the camp from the country round about even they also turned to be with the israelites that were with saul and jonathan 1422 likewise all the men of israel which had hid themselves in mount ephraim when they heard that the philistines fled even they also followed hard after them in the battle 1423 so the lord saved israel that day and the battle passed over unto bethaven 1424 and the men of israel were distressed that day for saul had adjured the people saying cursed be the man that eateth any food until evening that i may be avenged on mine enemies so none of the people tasted any food 1425 and all they of the land came to a wood and there was honey upon the ground 1426 and when the people were come into the wood behold the honey dropped but no man put his hand to his mouth for the people feared the oath 1427 but jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with the oath wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in an honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth and his eyes were enlightened 1428 then answered one of the people and said thy father straitly charged the people with an oath saying cursed be the man that eateth any food this day and the people were faint 1429 then said jonathan my father hath troubled the land see i pray you how mine eyes have been enlightened because i tasted a little of this honey 1430 how much more if haply the people had eaten freely to day of the spoil of their enemies which they found for had there not been now a much greater slaughter among the philistines 1431 and they smote the philistines that day from michmash to aijalon and the people were very faint 1432 and the people flew upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slew them on the ground and the people did eat them with the blood 1433 then they told saul saying behold the people sin against the lord in that they eat with the blood and he said ye have transgressed roll a great stone unto me this day 1434 and saul said disperse yourselves among the people and say unto them bring me hither every man his ox and every man his sheep and slay them here and eat and sin not against the lord in eating with the blood and all the people brought every man his ox with him that night and slew them there 1435 and saul built an altar unto the lord the same was the first altar that he built unto the lord 1436 and saul said let us go down after the philistines by night and spoil them until the morning light and let us not leave a man of them and they said do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee then said the priest let us draw near hither unto god 1437 and saul asked counsel of god shall i go down after the philistines wilt thou deliver them into the hand of israel but he answered him not that day 1438 and saul said draw ye near hither all the chief of the people and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day 1439 for as the lord liveth which saveth israel though it be in jonathan my son he shall surely die but there was not a man among all the people that answered him 1440 then said he unto all israel be ye on one side and i and jonathan my son will be on the other side and the people said unto saul do what seemeth good unto thee 1441 therefore saul said unto the lord god of israel give a perfect lot and saul and jonathan were taken but the people escaped 1442 and saul said cast lots between me and jonathan my son and jonathan was taken 1443 then saul said to jonathan tell me what thou hast done and jonathan told him and said i did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in mine hand and lo i must die 1444 and saul answered god do so and more also for thou shalt surely die jonathan 1445 and the people said unto saul shall jonathan die who hath wrought this great salvation in israel god forbid as the lord liveth there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground for he hath wrought with god this day so the people rescued jonathan that he died not 1446 then saul went up from following the philistines and the philistines went to their own place 1447 so saul took the kingdom over israel and fought against all his enemies on every side against moab and against the children of ammon and against edom and against the kings of zobah and against the philistines and whithersoever he turned himself he vexed them 1448 and he gathered an host and smote the amalekites and delivered israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them 1449 now the sons of saul were jonathan and ishui and melchishua and the names of his two daughters were these the name of the firstborn merab and the name of the younger michal 1450 and the name of sauls wife was ahinoam the daughter of ahimaaz and the name of the captain of his host was abner the son of ner sauls uncle 1451 and kish was the father of saul and ner the father of abner was the son of abiel 1452 and there was sore war against the philistines all the days of saul and when saul saw any strong man or any valiant man he took him unto him 151 samuel also said unto saul the lord sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people over israel now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the lord 152 thus saith the lord of hosts i remember that which amalek did to israel how he laid wait for him in the way when he came up from egypt 153 now go and smite amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare them not but slay both man and woman infant and suckling ox and sheep camel and ass 154 and saul gathered the people together and numbered them in telaim two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of judah 155 and saul came to a city of amalek and laid wait in the valley 156 and saul said unto the kenites go depart get you down from among the amalekites lest i destroy you with them for ye shewed kindness to all the children of israel when they came up out of egypt so the kenites departed from among the amalekites 157 and saul smote the amalekites from havilah until thou comest to shur that is over against egypt 158 and he took agag the king of the amalekites alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword 159 but saul and the people spared agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them but every thing that was vile and refuse that they destroyed utterly 1510 then came the word of the lord unto samuel saying 1511 it repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he is turned back from following me and hath not performed my commandments and it grieved samuel and he cried unto the lord all night 1512 and when samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning it was told samuel saying saul came to carmel and behold he set him up a place and is gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal 1513 and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou of the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord 1514 and samuel said what meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which i hear 1515 and saul said they have brought them from the amalekites for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed 1516 then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what the lord hath said to me this night and he said unto him say on 1517 and samuel said when thou wast little in thine own sight wast thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed thee king over israel 1518 and the lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed 1519 wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the lord but didst fly upon the spoil and didst evil in the sight of the lord 1520 and saul said unto samuel yea i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone the way which the lord sent me and have brought agag the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites 1521 but the people took of the spoil sheep and oxen the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the lord thy god in gilgal 1522 and samuel said hath the lord as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of rams 1523 for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou hast rejected the word of the lord he hath also rejected thee from being king 1524 and saul said unto samuel i have sinned for i have transgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words because i feared the people and obeyed their voice 1525 now therefore i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that i may worship the lord 1526 and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee for thou hast rejected the word of the lord and the lord hath rejected thee from being king over israel 1527 and as samuel turned about to go away he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle and it rent 1528 and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day and hath given it to a neighbour of thine that is better than thou 1529 and also the strength of israel will not lie nor repent for he is not a man that he should repent 1530 then he said i have sinned yet honour me now i pray thee before the elders of my people and before israel and turn again with me that i may worship the lord thy god 1531 so samuel turned again after saul and saul worshipped the lord 1532 then said samuel bring ye hither to me agag the king of the amalekites and agag came unto him delicately and agag said surely the bitterness of death is past 1533 and samuel said as the sword hath made women childless so shall thy mother be childless among women and samuel hewed agag in pieces before the lord in gilgal 1534 then samuel went to ramah and saul went up to his house to gibeah of saul 1535 and samuel came no more to see saul until the day of his death nevertheless samuel mourned for saul and the lord repented that he had made saul king over israel 161 and the lord said unto samuel how long wilt thou mourn for saul seeing i have rejected him from reigning over israel fill thine horn with oil and go i will send thee to jesse the bethlehemite for i have provided me a king among his sons 162 and samuel said how can i go if saul hear it he will kill me and the lord said take an heifer with thee and say i am come to sacrifice to the lord 163 and call jesse to the sacrifice and i will shew thee what thou shalt do and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom i name unto thee 164 and samuel did that which the lord spake and came to bethlehem and the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said comest thou peaceably 165 and he said peaceably i am come to sacrifice unto the lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and he sanctified jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice 166 and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on eliab and said surely the lords anointed is before him 167 but the lord said unto samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because i have refused him for the lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart 168 then jesse called abinadab and made him pass before samuel and he said neither hath the lord chosen this 169 then jesse made shammah to pass by and he said neither hath the lord chosen this 1610 again jesse made seven of his sons to pass before samuel and samuel said unto jesse the lord hath not chosen these 1611 and samuel said unto jesse are here all thy children and he said there remaineth yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and samuel said unto jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come hither 1612 and he sent and brought him in now he was ruddy and withal of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the lord said arise anoint him for this is he 1613 then samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren and the spirit of the lord came upon david from that day forward so samuel rose up and went to ramah 1614 but the spirit of the lord departed from saul and an evil spirit from the lord troubled him 1615 and sauls servants said unto him behold now an evil spirit from god troubleth thee 1616 let our lord now command thy servants which are before thee to seek out a man who is a cunning player on an harp and it shall come to pass when the evil spirit from god is upon thee that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt be well 1617 and saul said unto his servants provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to me 1618 then answered one of the servants and said behold i have seen a son of jesse the bethlehemite that is cunning in playing and a mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in matters and a comely person and the lord is with him 1619 wherefore saul sent messengers unto jesse and said send me david thy son which is with the sheep 1620 and jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine and a kid and sent them by david his son unto saul 1621 and david came to saul and stood before him and he loved him greatly and he became his armourbearer 1622 and saul sent to jesse saying let david i pray thee stand before me for he hath found favour in my sight 1623 and it came to pass when the evil spirit from god was upon saul that david took an harp and played with his hand so saul was refreshed and was well and the evil spirit departed from him 171 now the philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at shochoh which belongeth to judah and pitched between shochoh and azekah in ephesdammim 172 and saul and the men of israel were gathered together and pitched by the valley of elah and set the battle in array against the philistines 173 and the philistines stood on a mountain on the one side and israel stood on a mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them 174 and there went out a champion out of the camp of the philistines named goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span 175 and he had an helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass 176 and he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass between his shoulders 177 and the staff of his spear was like a weavers beam and his spears head weighed six hundred shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before him 178 and he stood and cried unto the armies of israel and said unto them why are ye come out to set your battle in array am not i a philistine and ye servants to saul choose you a man for you and let him come down to me 179 if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will we be your servants but if i prevail against him and kill him then shall ye be our servants and serve us 1710 and the philistine said i defy the armies of israel this day give me a man that we may fight together 1711 when saul and all israel heard those words of the philistine they were dismayed and greatly afraid 1712 now david was the son of that ephrathite of bethlehemjudah whose name was jesse and he had eight sons and the man went among men for an old man in the days of saul 1713 and the three eldest sons of jesse went and followed saul to the battle and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were eliab the firstborn and next unto him abinadab and the third shammah 1714 and david was the youngest and the three eldest followed saul 1715 but david went and returned from saul to feed his fathers sheep at bethlehem 1716 and the philistine drew near morning and evening and presented himself forty days 1717 and jesse said unto david his son take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched corn and these ten loaves and run to the camp of thy brethren 1718 and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand and look how thy brethren fare and take their pledge 1719 now saul and they and all the men of israel were in the valley of elah fighting with the philistines 1720 and david rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took and went as jesse had commanded him and he came to the trench as the host was going forth to the fight and shouted for the battle 1721 for israel and the philistines had put the battle in array army against army 1722 and david left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and came and saluted his brethren 1723 and as he talked with them behold there came up the champion the philistine of gath goliath by name out of the armies of the philistines and spake according to the same words and david heard them 1724 and all the men of israel when they saw the man fled from him and were sore afraid 1725 and the men of israel said have ye seen this man that is come up surely to defy israel is he come up and it shall be that the man who killeth him the king will enrich him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his fathers house free in israel 1726 and david spake to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that killeth this philistine and taketh away the reproach from israel for who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god 1727 and the people answered him after this manner saying so shall it be done to the man that killeth him 1728 and eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men and eliabs anger was kindled against david and he said why camest thou down hither and with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness i know thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that thou mightest see the battle 1729 and david said what have i now done is there not a cause 1730 and he turned from him toward another and spake after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former manner 1731 and when the words were heard which david spake they rehearsed them before saul and he sent for him 1732 and david said to saul let no mans heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this philistine 1733 and saul said to david thou art not able to go against this philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he a man of war from his youth 1734 and david said unto saul thy servant kept his fathers sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock 1735 and i went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me i caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him 1736 thy servant slew both the lion and the bear and this uncircumcised philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath defied the armies of the living god 1737 david said moreover the lord that delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this philistine and saul said unto david go and the lord be with thee 1738 and saul armed david with his armour and he put an helmet of brass upon his head also he armed him with a coat of mail 1739 and david girded his sword upon his armour and he assayed to go for he had not proved it and david said unto saul i cannot go with these for i have not proved them and david put them off him 1740 and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherds bag which he had even in a scrip and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the philistine 1741 and the philistine came on and drew near unto david and the man that bare the shield went before him 1742 and when the philistine looked about and saw david he disdained him for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair countenance 1743 and the philistine said unto david am i a dog that thou comest to me with staves and the philistine cursed david by his gods 1744 and the philistine said to david come to me and i will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the air and to the beasts of the field 1745 then said david to the philistine thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou hast defied 1746 this day will the lord deliver thee into mine hand and i will smite thee and take thine head from thee and i will give the carcases of the host of the philistines this day unto the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know that there is a god in israel 1747 and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lords and he will give you into our hands 1748 and it came to pass when the philistine arose and came and drew nigh to meet david that david hastened and ran toward the army to meet the philistine 1749 and david put his hand in his bag and took thence a stone and slang it and smote the philistine in his forehead that the stone sunk into his forehead and he fell upon his face to the earth 1750 so david prevailed over the philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the philistine and slew him but there was no sword in the hand of david 1751 therefore david ran and stood upon the philistine and took his sword and drew it out of the sheath thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith and when the philistines saw their champion was dead they fled 1752 and the men of israel and of judah arose and shouted and pursued the philistines until thou come to the valley and to the gates of ekron and the wounded of the philistines fell down by the way to shaaraim even unto gath and unto ekron 1753 and the children of israel returned from chasing after the philistines and they spoiled their tents 1754 and david took the head of the philistine and brought it to jerusalem but he put his armour in his tent 1755 and when saul saw david go forth against the philistine he said unto abner the captain of the host abner whose son is this youth and abner said as thy soul liveth o king i cannot tell 1756 and the king said enquire thou whose son the stripling is 1757 and as david returned from the slaughter of the philistine abner took him and brought him before saul with the head of the philistine in his hand 1758 and saul said to him whose son art thou thou young man and david answered i am the son of thy servant jesse the bethlehemite 181 and it came to pass when he had made an end of speaking unto saul that the soul of jonathan was knit with the soul of david and jonathan loved him as his own soul 182 and saul took him that day and would let him go no more home to his fathers house 183 then jonathan and david made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul 184 and jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to david and his garments even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle 185 and david went out whithersoever saul sent him and behaved himself wisely and saul set him over the men of war and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of sauls servants 186 and it came to pass as they came when david was returned from the slaughter of the philistine that the women came out of all cities of israel singing and dancing to meet king saul with tabrets with joy and with instruments of musick 187 and the women answered one another as they played and said saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands 188 and saul was very wroth and the saying displeased him and he said they have ascribed unto david ten thousands and to me they have ascribed but thousands and what can he have more but the kingdom 189 and saul eyed david from that day and forward 1810 and it came to pass on the morrow that the evil spirit from god came upon saul and he prophesied in the midst of the house and david played with his hand as at other times and there was a javelin in sauls hand 1811 and saul cast the javelin for he said i will smite david even to the wall with it and david avoided out of his presence twice 1812 and saul was afraid of david because the lord was with him and was departed from saul 1813 therefore saul removed him from him and made him his captain over a thousand and he went out and came in before the people 1814 and david behaved himself wisely in all his ways and the lord was with him 1815 wherefore when saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely he was afraid of him 1816 but all israel and judah loved david because he went out and came in before them 1817 and saul said to david behold my elder daughter merab her will i give thee to wife only be thou valiant for me and fight the lords battles for saul said let not mine hand be upon him but let the hand of the philistines be upon him 1818 and david said unto saul who am i and what is my life or my fathers family in israel that i should be son in law to the king 1819 but it came to pass at the time when merab sauls daughter should have been given to david that she was given unto adriel the meholathite to wife 1820 and michal sauls daughter loved david and they told saul and the thing pleased him 1821 and saul said i will give him her that she may be a snare to him and that the hand of the philistines may be against him wherefore saul said to david thou shalt this day be my son in law in the one of the twain 1822 and saul commanded his servants saying commune with david secretly and say behold the king hath delight in thee and all his servants love thee now therefore be the kings son in law 1823 and sauls servants spake those words in the ears of david and david said seemeth it to you a light thing to be a kings son in law seeing that i am a poor man and lightly esteemed 1824 and the servants of saul told him saying on this manner spake david 1825 and saul said thus shall ye say to david the king desireth not any dowry but an hundred foreskins of the philistines to be avenged of the kings enemies but saul thought to make david fall by the hand of the philistines 1826 and when his servants told david these words it pleased david well to be the kings son in law and the days were not expired 1827 wherefore david arose and went he and his men and slew of the philistines two hundred men and david brought their foreskins and they gave them in full tale to the king that he might be the kings son in law and saul gave him michal his daughter to wife 1828 and saul saw and knew that the lord was with david and that michal sauls daughter loved him 1829 and saul was yet the more afraid of david and saul became davids enemy continually 1830 then the princes of the philistines went forth and it came to pass after they went forth that david behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of saul so that his name was much set by 191 and saul spake to jonathan his son and to all his servants that they should kill david 192 but jonathan sauls son delighted much in david and jonathan told david saying saul my father seeketh to kill thee now therefore i pray thee take heed to thyself until the morning and abide in a secret place and hide thyself 193 and i will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art and i will commune with my father of thee and what i see that i will tell thee 194 and jonathan spake good of david unto saul his father and said unto him let not the king sin against his servant against david because he hath not sinned against thee and because his works have been to theeward very good 195 for he did put his life in his hand and slew the philistine and the lord wrought a great salvation for all israel thou sawest it and didst rejoice wherefore then wilt thou sin against innocent blood to slay david without a cause 196 and saul hearkened unto the voice of jonathan and saul sware as the lord liveth he shall not be slain 197 and jonathan called david and jonathan shewed him all those things and jonathan brought david to saul and he was in his presence as in times past 198 and there was war again and david went out and fought with the philistines and slew them with a great slaughter and they fled from him 199 and the evil spirit from the lord was upon saul as he sat in his house with his javelin in his hand and david played with his hand 1910 and saul sought to smite david even to the wall with the javelin but he slipped away out of sauls presence and he smote the javelin into the wall and david fled and escaped that night 1911 saul also sent messengers unto davids house to watch him and to slay him in the morning and michal davids wife told him saying if thou save not thy life to night to morrow thou shalt be slain 1912 so michal let david down through a window and he went and fled and escaped 1913 and michal took an image and laid it in the bed and put a pillow of goats hair for his bolster and covered it with a cloth 1914 and when saul sent messengers to take david she said he is sick 1915 and saul sent the messengers again to see david saying bring him up to me in the bed that i may slay him 1916 and when the messengers were come in behold there was an image in the bed with a pillow of goats hair for his bolster 1917 and saul said unto michal why hast thou deceived me so and sent away mine enemy that he is escaped and michal answered saul he said unto me let me go why should i kill thee 1918 so david fled and escaped and came to samuel to ramah and told him all that saul had done to him and he and samuel went and dwelt in naioth 1919 and it was told saul saying behold david is at naioth in ramah 1920 and saul sent messengers to take david and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and samuel standing as appointed over them the spirit of god was upon the messengers of saul and they also prophesied 1921 and when it was told saul he sent other messengers and they prophesied likewise and saul sent messengers again the third time and they prophesied also 1922 then went he also to ramah and came to a great well that is in sechu and he asked and said where are samuel and david and one said behold they be at naioth in ramah 1923 and he went thither to naioth in ramah and the spirit of god was upon him also and he went on and prophesied until he came to naioth in ramah 1924 and he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before samuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that night wherefore they say is saul also among the prophets 201 and david fled from naioth in ramah and came and said before jonathan what have i done what is mine iniquity and what is my sin before thy father that he seeketh my life 202 and he said unto him god forbid thou shalt not die behold my father will do nothing either great or small but that he will shew it me and why should my father hide this thing from me it is not so 203 and david sware moreover and said thy father certainly knoweth that i have found grace in thine eyes and he saith let not jonathan know this lest he be grieved but truly as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth there is but a step between me and death 204 then said jonathan unto david whatsoever thy soul desireth i will even do it for thee 205 and david said unto jonathan behold to morrow is the new moon and i should not fail to sit with the king at meat but let me go that i may hide myself in the field unto the third day at even 206 if thy father at all miss me then say david earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to bethlehem his city for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family 207 if he say thus it is well thy servant shall have peace but if he be very wroth then be sure that evil is determined by him 208 therefore thou shalt deal kindly with thy servant for thou hast brought thy servant into a covenant of the lord with thee notwithstanding if there be in me iniquity slay me thyself for why shouldest thou bring me to thy father 209 and jonathan said far be it from thee for if i knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee then would not i tell it thee 2010 then said david to jonathan who shall tell me or what if thy father answer thee roughly 2011 and jonathan said unto david come and let us go out into the field and they went out both of them into the field 2012 and jonathan said unto david o lord god of israel when i have sounded my father about to morrow any time or the third day and behold if there be good toward david and i then send not unto thee and shew it thee 2013 the lord do so and much more to jonathan but if it please my father to do thee evil then i will shew it thee and send thee away that thou mayest go in peace and the lord be with thee as he hath been with my father 2014 and thou shalt not only while yet i live shew me the kindness of the lord that i die not 2015 but also thou shalt not cut off thy kindness from my house for ever no not when the lord hath cut off the enemies of david every one from the face of the earth 2016 so jonathan made a covenant with the house of david saying let the lord even require it at the hand of davids enemies 2017 and jonathan caused david to swear again because he loved him for he loved him as he loved his own soul 2018 then jonathan said to david to morrow is the new moon and thou shalt be missed because thy seat will be empty 2019 and when thou hast stayed three days then thou shalt go down quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself when the business was in hand and shalt remain by the stone ezel 2020 and i will shoot three arrows on the side thereof as though i shot at a mark 2021 and behold i will send a lad saying go find out the arrows if i expressly say unto the lad behold the arrows are on this side of thee take them then come thou for there is peace to thee and no hurt as the lord liveth 2022 but if i say thus unto the young man behold the arrows are beyond thee go thy way for the lord hath sent thee away 2023 and as touching the matter which thou and i have spoken of behold the lord be between thee and me for ever 2024 so david hid himself in the field and when the new moon was come the king sat him down to eat meat 2025 and the king sat upon his seat as at other times even upon a seat by the wall and jonathan arose and abner sat by sauls side and davids place was empty 2026 nevertheless saul spake not any thing that day for he thought something hath befallen him he is not clean surely he is not clean 2027 and it came to pass on the morrow which was the second day of the month that davids place was empty and saul said unto jonathan his son wherefore cometh not the son of jesse to meat neither yesterday nor to day 2028 and jonathan answered saul david earnestly asked leave of me to go to bethlehem 2029 and he said let me go i pray thee for our family hath a sacrifice in the city and my brother he hath commanded me to be there and now if i have found favour in thine eyes let me get away i pray thee and see my brethren therefore he cometh not unto the kings table 2030 then sauls anger was kindled against jonathan and he said unto him thou son of the perverse rebellious woman do not i know that thou hast chosen the son of jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mothers nakedness 2031 for as long as the son of jesse liveth upon the ground thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom wherefore now send and fetch him unto me for he shall surely die 2032 and jonathan answered saul his father and said unto him wherefore shall he be slain what hath he done 2033 and saul cast a javelin at him to smite him whereby jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay david 2034 so jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and did eat no meat the second day of the month for he was grieved for david because his father had done him shame 2035 and it came to pass in the morning that jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with david and a little lad with him 2036 and he said unto his lad run find out now the arrows which i shoot and as the lad ran he shot an arrow beyond him 2037 and when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which jonathan had shot jonathan cried after the lad and said is not the arrow beyond thee 2038 and jonathan cried after the lad make speed haste stay not and jonathans lad gathered up the arrows and came to his master 2039 but the lad knew not any thing only jonathan and david knew the matter 2040 and jonathan gave his artillery unto his lad and said unto him go carry them to the city 2041 and as soon as the lad was gone david arose out of a place toward the south and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times and they kissed one another and wept one with another until david exceeded 2042 and jonathan said to david go in peace forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the lord saying the lord be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever and he arose and departed and jonathan went into the city 211 then came david to nob to ahimelech the priest and ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of david and said unto him why art thou alone and no man with thee 212 and david said unto ahimelech the priest the king hath commanded me a business and hath said unto me let no man know any thing of the business whereabout i send thee and what i have commanded thee and i have appointed my servants to such and such a place 213 now therefore what is under thine hand give me five loaves of bread in mine hand or what there is present 214 and the priest answered david and said there is no common bread under mine hand but there is hallowed bread if the young men have kept themselves at least from women 215 and david answered the priest and said unto him of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days since i came out and the vessels of the young men are holy and the bread is in a manner common yea though it were sanctified this day in the vessel 216 so the priest gave him hallowed bread for there was no bread there but the shewbread that was taken from before the lord to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away 217 now a certain man of the servants of saul was there that day detained before the lord and his name was doeg an edomite the chiefest of the herdmen that belonged to saul 218 and david said unto ahimelech and is there not here under thine hand spear or sword for i have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the kings business required haste 219 and the priest said the sword of goliath the philistine whom thou slewest in the valley of elah behold it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if thou wilt take that take it for there is no other save that here and david said there is none like that give it me 2110 and david arose and fled that day for fear of saul and went to achish the king of gath 2111 and the servants of achish said unto him is not this david the king of the land did they not sing one to another of him in dances saying saul hath slain his thousands and david his ten thousands 2112 and david laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid of achish the king of gath 2113 and he changed his behaviour before them and feigned himself mad in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down upon his beard 2114 then said achish unto his servants lo ye see the man is mad wherefore then have ye brought him to me 2115 have i need of mad men that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence shall this fellow come into my house 221 david therefore departed thence and escaped to the cave adullam and when his brethren and all his fathers house heard it they went down thither to him 222 and every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and every one that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and there were with him about four hundred men 223 and david went thence to mizpeh of moab and he said unto the king of moab let my father and my mother i pray thee come forth and be with you till i know what god will do for me 224 and he brought them before the king of moab and they dwelt with him all the while that david was in the hold 225 and the prophet gad said unto david abide not in the hold depart and get thee into the land of judah then david departed and came into the forest of hareth 226 when saul heard that david was discovered and the men that were with him now saul abode in gibeah under a tree in ramah having his spear in his hand and all his servants were standing about him 227 then saul said unto his servants that stood about him hear now ye benjamites will the son of jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards and make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds 228 that all of you have conspired against me and there is none that sheweth me that my son hath made a league with the son of jesse and there is none of you that is sorry for me or sheweth unto me that my son hath stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait as at this day 229 then answered doeg the edomite which was set over the servants of saul and said i saw the son of jesse coming to nob to ahimelech the son of ahitub 2210 and he enquired of the lord for him and gave him victuals and gave him the sword of goliath the philistine 2211 then the king sent to call ahimelech the priest the son of ahitub and all his fathers house the priests that were in nob and they came all of them to the king 2212 and saul said hear now thou son of ahitub and he answered here i am my lord 2213 and saul said unto him why have ye conspired against me thou and the son of jesse in that thou hast given him bread and a sword and hast enquired of god for him that he should rise against me to lie in wait as at this day 2214 then ahimelech answered the king and said and who is so faithful among all thy servants as david which is the kings son in law and goeth at thy bidding and is honourable in thine house 2215 did i then begin to enquire of god for him be it far from me let not the king impute any thing unto his servant nor to all the house of my father for thy servant knew nothing of all this less or more 2216 and the king said thou shalt surely die ahimelech thou and all thy fathers house 2217 and the king said unto the footmen that stood about him turn and slay the priests of the lord because their hand also is with david and because they knew when he fled and did not shew it to me but the servants of the king would not put forth their hand to fall upon the priests of the lord 2218 and the king said to doeg turn thou and fall upon the priests and doeg the edomite turned and he fell upon the priests and slew on that day fourscore and five persons that did wear a linen ephod 2219 and nob the city of the priests smote he with the edge of the sword both men and women children and sucklings and oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the sword 2220 and one of the sons of ahimelech the son of ahitub named abiathar escaped and fled after david 2221 and abiathar shewed david that saul had slain the lords priests 2222 and david said unto abiathar i knew it that day when doeg the edomite was there that he would surely tell saul i have occasioned the death of all the persons of thy fathers house 2223 abide thou with me fear not for he that seeketh my life seeketh thy life but with me thou shalt be in safeguard 231 then they told david saying behold the philistines fight against keilah and they rob the threshingfloors 232 therefore david enquired of the lord saying shall i go and smite these philistines and the lord said unto david go and smite the philistines and save keilah 233 and davids men said unto him behold we be afraid here in judah how much more then if we come to keilah against the armies of the philistines 234 then david enquired of the lord yet again and the lord answered him and said arise go down to keilah for i will deliver the philistines into thine hand 235 so david and his men went to keilah and fought with the philistines and brought away their cattle and smote them with a great slaughter so david saved the inhabitants of keilah 236 and it came to pass when abiathar the son of ahimelech fled to david to keilah that he came down with an ephod in his hand 237 and it was told saul that david was come to keilah and saul said god hath delivered him into mine hand for he is shut in by entering into a town that hath gates and bars 238 and saul called all the people together to war to go down to keilah to besiege david and his men 239 and david knew that saul secretly practised mischief against him and he said to abiathar the priest bring hither the ephod 2310 then said david o lord god of israel thy servant hath certainly heard that saul seeketh to come to keilah to destroy the city for my sake 2311 will the men of keilah deliver me up into his hand will saul come down as thy servant hath heard o lord god of israel i beseech thee tell thy servant and the lord said he will come down 2312 then said david will the men of keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of saul and the lord said they will deliver thee up 2313 then david and his men which were about six hundred arose and departed out of keilah and went whithersoever they could go and it was told saul that david was escaped from keilah and he forbare to go forth 2314 and david abode in the wilderness in strong holds and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of ziph and saul sought him every day but god delivered him not into his hand 2315 and david saw that saul was come out to seek his life and david was in the wilderness of ziph in a wood 2316 and jonathan sauls son arose and went to david into the wood and strengthened his hand in god 2317 and he said unto him fear not for the hand of saul my father shall not find thee and thou shalt be king over israel and i shall be next unto thee and that also saul my father knoweth 2318 and they two made a covenant before the lord and david abode in the wood and jonathan went to his house 2319 then came up the ziphites to saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood in the hill of hachilah which is on the south of jeshimon 2320 now therefore o king come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down and our part shall be to deliver him into the kings hand 2321 and saul said blessed be ye of the lord for ye have compassion on me 2322 go i pray you prepare yet and know and see his place where his haunt is and who hath seen him there for it is told me that he dealeth very subtilly 2323 see therefore and take knowledge of all the lurking places where he hideth himself and come ye again to me with the certainty and i will go with you and it shall come to pass if he be in the land that i will search him out throughout all the thousands of judah 2324 and they arose and went to ziph before saul but david and his men were in the wilderness of maon in the plain on the south of jeshimon 2325 saul also and his men went to seek him and they told david wherefore he came down into a rock and abode in the wilderness of maon and when saul heard that he pursued after david in the wilderness of maon 2326 and saul went on this side of the mountain and david and his men on that side of the mountain and david made haste to get away for fear of saul for saul and his men compassed david and his men round about to take them 2327 but there came a messenger unto saul saying haste thee and come for the philistines have invaded the land 2328 wherefore saul returned from pursuing after david and went against the philistines therefore they called that place selahammahlekoth 2329 and david went up from thence and dwelt in strong holds at engedi 241 and it came to pass when saul was returned from following the philistines that it was told him saying behold david is in the wilderness of engedi 242 then saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel and went to seek david and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats 243 and he came to the sheepcotes by the way where was a cave and saul went in to cover his feet and david and his men remained in the sides of the cave 244 and the men of david said unto him behold the day of which the lord said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thine hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then david arose and cut off the skirt of sauls robe privily 245 and it came to pass afterward that davids heart smote him because he had cut off sauls skirt 246 and he said unto his men the lord forbid that i should do this thing unto my master the lords anointed to stretch forth mine hand against him seeing he is the anointed of the lord 247 so david stayed his servants with these words and suffered them not to rise against saul but saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way 248 david also arose afterward and went out of the cave and cried after saul saying my lord the king and when saul looked behind him david stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself 249 and david said to saul wherefore hearest thou mens words saying behold david seeketh thy hurt 2410 behold this day thine eyes have seen how that the lord had delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave and some bade me kill thee but mine eye spared thee and i said i will not put forth mine hand against my lord for he is the lords anointed 2411 moreover my father see yea see the skirt of thy robe in my hand for in that i cut off the skirt of thy robe and killed thee not know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine hand and i have not sinned against thee yet thou huntest my soul to take it 2412 the lord judge between me and thee and the lord avenge me of thee but mine hand shall not be upon thee 2413 as saith the proverb of the ancients wickedness proceedeth from the wicked but mine hand shall not be upon thee 2414 after whom is the king of israel come out after whom dost thou pursue after a dead dog after a flea 2415 the lord therefore be judge and judge between me and thee and see and plead my cause and deliver me out of thine hand 2416 and it came to pass when david had made an end of speaking these words unto saul that saul said is this thy voice my son david and saul lifted up his voice and wept 2417 and he said to david thou art more righteous than i for thou hast rewarded me good whereas i have rewarded thee evil 2418 and thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me forasmuch as when the lord had delivered me into thine hand thou killedst me not 2419 for if a man find his enemy will he let him go well away wherefore the lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day 2420 and now behold i know well that thou shalt surely be king and that the kingdom of israel shall be established in thine hand 2421 swear now therefore unto me by the lord that thou wilt not cut off my seed after me and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my fathers house 2422 and david sware unto saul and saul went home but david and his men gat them up unto the hold 251 and samuel died and all the israelites were gathered together and lamented him and buried him in his house at ramah and david arose and went down to the wilderness of paran 252 and there was a man in maon whose possessions were in carmel and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in carmel 253 now the name of the man was nabal and the name of his wife abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he was of the house of caleb 254 and david heard in the wilderness that nabal did shear his sheep 255 and david sent out ten young men and david said unto the young men get you up to carmel and go to nabal and greet him in my name 256 and thus shall ye say to him that liveth in prosperity peace be both to thee and peace be to thine house and peace be unto all that thou hast 257 and now i have heard that thou hast shearers now thy shepherds which were with us we hurt them not neither was there ought missing unto them all the while they were in carmel 258 ask thy young men and they will shew thee wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes for we come in a good day give i pray thee whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and to thy son david 259 and when davids young men came they spake to nabal according to all those words in the name of david and ceased 2510 and nabal answered davids servants and said who is david and who is the son of jesse there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master 2511 shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i have killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom i know not whence they be 2512 so davids young men turned their way and went again and came and told him all those sayings 2513 and david said unto his men gird ye on every man his sword and they girded on every man his sword and david also girded on his sword and there went up after david about four hundred men and two hundred abode by the stuff 2514 but one of the young men told abigail nabals wife saying behold david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master and he railed on them 2515 but the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt neither missed we any thing as long as we were conversant with them when we were in the fields 2516 they were a wall unto us both by night and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep 2517 now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do for evil is determined against our master and against all his household for he is such a son of belial that a man cannot speak to him 2518 then abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched corn and an hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on asses 2519 and she said unto her servants go on before me behold i come after you but she told not her husband nabal 2520 and it was so as she rode on the ass that she came down by the covert on the hill and behold david and his men came down against her and she met them 2521 now david had said surely in vain have i kept all that this fellow hath in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him and he hath requited me evil for good 2522 so and more also do god unto the enemies of david if i leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall 2523 and when abigail saw david she hasted and lighted off the ass and fell before david on her face and bowed herself to the ground 2524 and fell at his feet and said upon me my lord upon me let this iniquity be and let thine handmaid i pray thee speak in thine audience and hear the words of thine handmaid 2525 let not my lord i pray thee regard this man of belial even nabal for as his name is so is he nabal is his name and folly is with him but i thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom thou didst send 2526 now therefore my lord as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth seeing the lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine enemies and they that seek evil to my lord be as nabal 2527 and now this blessing which thine handmaid hath brought unto my lord let it even be given unto the young men that follow my lord 2528 i pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for the lord will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lord fighteth the battles of the lord and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days 2529 yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the lord thy god and the souls of thine enemies them shall he sling out as out of the middle of a sling 2530 and it shall come to pass when the lord shall have done to my lord according to all the good that he hath spoken concerning thee and shall have appointed thee ruler over israel 2531 that this shall be no grief unto thee nor offence of heart unto my lord either that thou hast shed blood causeless or that my lord hath avenged himself but when the lord shall have dealt well with my lord then remember thine handmaid 2532 and david said to abigail blessed be the lord god of israel which sent thee this day to meet me 2533 and blessed be thy advice and blessed be thou which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand 2534 for in very deed as the lord god of israel liveth which hath kept me back from hurting thee except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me surely there had not been left unto nabal by the morning light any that pisseth against the wall 2535 so david received of her hand that which she had brought him and said unto her go up in peace to thine house see i have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person 2536 and abigail came to nabal and behold he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king and nabals heart was merry within him for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less or more until the morning light 2537 but it came to pass in the morning when the wine was gone out of nabal and his wife had told him these things that his heart died within him and he became as a stone 2538 and it came to pass about ten days after that the lord smote nabal that he died 2539 and when david heard that nabal was dead he said blessed be the lord that hath pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand of nabal and hath kept his servant from evil for the lord hath returned the wickedness of nabal upon his own head and david sent and communed with abigail to take her to him to wife 2540 and when the servants of david were come to abigail to carmel they spake unto her saying david sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife 2541 and she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth and said behold let thine handmaid be a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my lord 2542 and abigail hasted and arose and rode upon an ass with five damsels of hers that went after her and she went after the messengers of david and became his wife 2543 david also took ahinoam of jezreel and they were also both of them his wives 2544 but saul had given michal his daughter davids wife to phalti the son of laish which was of gallim 261 and the ziphites came unto saul to gibeah saying doth not david hide himself in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon 262 then saul arose and went down to the wilderness of ziph having three thousand chosen men of israel with him to seek david in the wilderness of ziph 263 and saul pitched in the hill of hachilah which is before jeshimon by the way but david abode in the wilderness and he saw that saul came after him into the wilderness 264 david therefore sent out spies and understood that saul was come in very deed 265 and david arose and came to the place where saul had pitched and david beheld the place where saul lay and abner the son of ner the captain of his host and saul lay in the trench and the people pitched round about him 266 then answered david and said to ahimelech the hittite and to abishai the son of zeruiah brother to joab saying who will go down with me to saul to the camp and abishai said i will go down with thee 267 so david and abishai came to the people by night and behold saul lay sleeping within the trench and his spear stuck in the ground at his bolster but abner and the people lay round about him 268 then said abishai to david god hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this day now therefore let me smite him i pray thee with the spear even to the earth at once and i will not smite him the second time 269 and david said to abishai destroy him not for who can stretch forth his hand against the lords anointed and be guiltless 2610 david said furthermore as the lord liveth the lord shall smite him or his day shall come to die or he shall descend into battle and perish 2611 the lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against the lords anointed but i pray thee take thou now the spear that is at his bolster and the cruse of water and let us go 2612 so david took the spear and the cruse of water from sauls bolster and they gat them away and no man saw it nor knew it neither awaked for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the lord was fallen upon them 2613 then david went over to the other side and stood on the top of an hill afar off a great space being between them 2614 and david cried to the people and to abner the son of ner saying answerest thou not abner then abner answered and said who art thou that criest to the king 2615 and david said to abner art not thou a valiant man and who is like to thee in israel wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy lord 2616 this thing is not good that thou hast done as the lord liveth ye are worthy to die because ye have not kept your master the lords anointed and now see where the kings spear is and the cruse of water that was at his bolster 2617 and saul knew davids voice and said is this thy voice my son david and david said it is my voice my lord o king 2618 and he said wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his servant for what have i done or what evil is in mine hand 2619 now therefore i pray thee let my lord the king hear the words of his servant if the lord have stirred thee up against me let him accept an offering but if they be the children of men cursed be they before the lord for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the lord saying go serve other gods 2620 now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth before the face of the lord for the king of israel is come out to seek a flea as when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains 2621 then said saul i have sinned return my son david for i will no more do thee harm because my soul was precious in thine eyes this day behold i have played the fool and have erred exceedingly 2622 and david answered and said behold the kings spear and let one of the young men come over and fetch it 2623 the lord render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness for the lord delivered thee into my hand to day but i would not stretch forth mine hand against the lords anointed 2624 and behold as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the lord and let him deliver me out of all tribulation 2625 then saul said to david blessed be thou my son david thou shalt both do great things and also shalt still prevail so david went on his way and saul returned to his place 271 and david said in his heart i shall now perish one day by the hand of saul there is nothing better for me than that i should speedily escape into the land of the philistines and saul shall despair of me to seek me any more in any coast of israel so shall i escape out of his hand 272 and david arose and he passed over with the six hundred men that were with him unto achish the son of maoch king of gath 273 and david dwelt with achish at gath he and his men every man with his household even david with his two wives ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the carmelitess nabals wife 274 and it was told saul that david was fled to gath and he sought no more again for him 275 and david said unto achish if i have now found grace in thine eyes let them give me a place in some town in the country that i may dwell there for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee 276 then achish gave him ziklag that day wherefore ziklag pertaineth unto the kings of judah unto this day 277 and the time that david dwelt in the country of the philistines was a full year and four months 278 and david and his men went up and invaded the geshurites and the gezrites and the amalekites for those nations were of old the inhabitants of the land as thou goest to shur even unto the land of egypt 279 and david smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive and took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the apparel and returned and came to achish 2710 and achish said whither have ye made a road to day and david said against the south of judah and against the south of the jerahmeelites and against the south of the kenites 2711 and david saved neither man nor woman alive to bring tidings to gath saying lest they should tell on us saying so did david and so will be his manner all the while he dwelleth in the country of the philistines 2712 and achish believed david saying he hath made his people israel utterly to abhor him therefore he shall be my servant for ever 281 and it came to pass in those days that the philistines gathered their armies together for warfare to fight with israel and achish said unto david know thou assuredly that thou shalt go out with me to battle thou and thy men 282 and david said to achish surely thou shalt know what thy servant can do and achish said to david therefore will i make thee keeper of mine head for ever 283 now samuel was dead and all israel had lamented him and buried him in ramah even in his own city and saul had put away those that had familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land 284 and the philistines gathered themselves together and came and pitched in shunem and saul gathered all israel together and they pitched in gilboa 285 and when saul saw the host of the philistines he was afraid and his heart greatly trembled 286 and when saul enquired of the lord the lord answered him not neither by dreams nor by urim nor by prophets 287 then said saul unto his servants seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit that i may go to her and enquire of her and his servants said to him behold there is a woman that hath a familiar spirit at endor 288 and saul disguised himself and put on other raiment and he went and two men with him and they came to the woman by night and he said i pray thee divine unto me by the familiar spirit and bring me him up whom i shall name unto thee 289 and the woman said unto him behold thou knowest what saul hath done how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits and the wizards out of the land wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life to cause me to die 2810 and saul sware to her by the lord saying as the lord liveth there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing 2811 then said the woman whom shall i bring up unto thee and he said bring me up samuel 2812 and when the woman saw samuel she cried with a loud voice and the woman spake to saul saying why hast thou deceived me for thou art saul 2813 and the king said unto her be not afraid for what sawest thou and the woman said unto saul i saw gods ascending out of the earth 2814 and he said unto her what form is he of and she said an old man cometh up and he is covered with a mantle and saul perceived that it was samuel and he stooped with his face to the ground and bowed himself 2815 and samuel said to saul why hast thou disquieted me to bring me up and saul answered i am sore distressed for the philistines make war against me and god is departed from me and answereth me no more neither by prophets nor by dreams therefore i have called thee that thou mayest make known unto me what i shall do 2816 then said samuel wherefore then dost thou ask of me seeing the lord is departed from thee and is become thine enemy 2817 and the lord hath done to him as he spake by me for the lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand and given it to thy neighbour even to david 2818 because thou obeyedst not the voice of the lord nor executedst his fierce wrath upon amalek therefore hath the lord done this thing unto thee this day 2819 moreover the lord will also deliver israel with thee into the hand of the philistines and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me the lord also shall deliver the host of israel into the hand of the philistines 2820 then saul fell straightway all along on the earth and was sore afraid because of the words of samuel and there was no strength in him for he had eaten no bread all the day nor all the night 2821 and the woman came unto saul and saw that he was sore troubled and said unto him behold thine handmaid hath obeyed thy voice and i have put my life in my hand and have hearkened unto thy words which thou spakest unto me 2822 now therefore i pray thee hearken thou also unto the voice of thine handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread before thee and eat that thou mayest have strength when thou goest on thy way 2823 but he refused and said i will not eat but his servants together with the woman compelled him and he hearkened unto their voice so he arose from the earth and sat upon the bed 2824 and the woman had a fat calf in the house and she hasted and killed it and took flour and kneaded it and did bake unleavened bread thereof 2825 and she brought it before saul and before his servants and they did eat then they rose up and went away that night 291 now the philistines gathered together all their armies to aphek and the israelites pitched by a fountain which is in jezreel 292 and the lords of the philistines passed on by hundreds and by thousands but david and his men passed on in the rereward with achish 293 then said the princes of the philistines what do these hebrews here and achish said unto the princes of the philistines is not this david the servant of saul the king of israel which hath been with me these days or these years and i have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day 294 and the princes of the philistines were wroth with him and the princes of the philistines said unto him make this fellow return that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him and let him not go down with us to battle lest in the battle he be an adversary to us for wherewith should he reconcile himself unto his master should it not be with the heads of these men 295 is not this david of whom they sang one to another in dances saying saul slew his thousands and david his ten thousands 296 then achish called david and said unto him surely as the lord liveth thou hast been upright and thy going out and thy coming in with me in the host is good in my sight for i have not found evil in thee since the day of thy coming unto me unto this day nevertheless the lords favour thee not 297 wherefore now return and go in peace that thou displease not the lords of the philistines 298 and david said unto achish but what have i done and what hast thou found in thy servant so long as i have been with thee unto this day that i may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king 299 and achish answered and said to david i know that thou art good in my sight as an angel of god notwithstanding the princes of the philistines have said he shall not go up with us to the battle 2910 wherefore now rise up early in the morning with thy masters servants that are come with thee and as soon as ye be up early in the morning and have light depart 2911 so david and his men rose up early to depart in the morning to return into the land of the philistines and the philistines went up to jezreel 301 and it came to pass when david and his men were come to ziklag on the third day that the amalekites had invaded the south and ziklag and smitten ziklag and burned it with fire 302 and had taken the women captives that were therein they slew not any either great or small but carried them away and went on their way 303 so david and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives 304 then david and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep 305 and davids two wives were taken captives ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite 306 and david was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved every man for his sons and for his daughters but david encouraged himself in the lord his god 307 and david said to abiathar the priest ahimelechs son i pray thee bring me hither the ephod and abiathar brought thither the ephod to david 308 and david enquired at the lord saying shall i pursue after this troop shall i overtake them and he answered him pursue for thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all 309 so david went he and the six hundred men that were with him and came to the brook besor where those that were left behind stayed 3010 but david pursued he and four hundred men for two hundred abode behind which were so faint that they could not go over the brook besor 3011 and they found an egyptian in the field and brought him to david and gave him bread and he did eat and they made him drink water 3012 and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins and when he had eaten his spirit came again to him for he had eaten no bread nor drunk any water three days and three nights 3013 and david said unto him to whom belongest thou and whence art thou and he said i am a young man of egypt servant to an amalekite and my master left me because three days agone i fell sick 3014 we made an invasion upon the south of the cherethites and upon the coast which belongeth to judah and upon the south of caleb and we burned ziklag with fire 3015 and david said to him canst thou bring me down to this company and he said swear unto me by god that thou wilt neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master and i will bring thee down to this company 3016 and when he had brought him down behold they were spread abroad upon all the earth eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the philistines and out of the land of judah 3017 and david smote them from the twilight even unto the evening of the next day and there escaped not a man of them save four hundred young men which rode upon camels and fled 3018 and david recovered all that the amalekites had carried away and david rescued his two wives 3019 and there was nothing lacking to them neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters neither spoil nor any thing that they had taken to them david recovered all 3020 and david took all the flocks and the herds which they drave before those other cattle and said this is davids spoil 3021 and david came to the two hundred men which were so faint that they could not follow david whom they had made also to abide at the brook besor and they went forth to meet david and to meet the people that were with him and when david came near to the people he saluted them 3022 then answered all the wicked men and men of belial of those that went with david and said because they went not with us we will not give them ought of the spoil that we have recovered save to every man his wife and his children that they may lead them away and depart 3023 then said david ye shall not do so my brethren with that which the lord hath given us who hath preserved us and delivered the company that came against us into our hand 3024 for who will hearken unto you in this matter but as his part is that goeth down to the battle so shall his part be that tarrieth by the stuff they shall part alike 3025 and it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute and an ordinance for israel unto this day 3026 and when david came to ziklag he sent of the spoil unto the elders of judah even to his friends saying behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the lord 3027 to them which were in bethel and to them which were in south ramoth and to them which were in jattir 3028 and to them which were in aroer and to them which were in siphmoth and to them which were in eshtemoa 3029 and to them which were in rachal and to them which were in the cities of the jerahmeelites and to them which were in the cities of the kenites 3030 and to them which were in hormah and to them which were in chorashan and to them which were in athach 3031 and to them which were in hebron and to all the places where david himself and his men were wont to haunt 311 now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa 312 and the philistines followed hard upon saul and upon his sons and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and melchishua sauls sons 313 and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit him and he was sore wounded of the archers 314 then said saul unto his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me but his armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid therefore saul took a sword and fell upon it 315 and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he fell likewise upon his sword and died with him 316 so saul died and his three sons and his armourbearer and all his men that same day together 317 and when the men of israel that were on the other side of the valley and they that were on the other side jordan saw that the men of israel fled and that saul and his sons were dead they forsook the cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them 318 and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his three sons fallen in mount gilboa 319 and they cut off his head and stripped off his armour and sent into the land of the philistines round about to publish it in the house of their idols and among the people 3110 and they put his armour in the house of ashtaroth and they fastened his body to the wall of bethshan 3111 and when the inhabitants of jabeshgilead heard of that which the philistines had done to saul 3112 all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of bethshan and came to jabesh and burnt them there 3113 and they took their bones and buried them under a tree at jabesh and fasted seven days the second book of samuel otherwise called the second book of the kings 11 now it came to pass after the death of saul when david was returned from the slaughter of the amalekites and david had abode two days in ziklag 12 it came even to pass on the third day that behold a man came out of the camp from saul with his clothes rent and earth upon his head and so it was when he came to david that he fell to the earth and did obeisance 13 and david said unto him from whence comest thou and he said unto him out of the camp of israel am i escaped 14 and david said unto him how went the matter i pray thee tell me and he answered that the people are fled from the battle and many of the people also are fallen and dead and saul and jonathan his son are dead also 15 and david said unto the young man that told him how knowest thou that saul and jonathan his son be dead 16 and the young man that told him said as i happened by chance upon mount gilboa behold saul leaned upon his spear and lo the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him 17 and when he looked behind him he saw me and called unto me and i answered here am i 18 and he said unto me who art thou and i answered him i am an amalekite 19 he said unto me again stand i pray thee upon me and slay me for anguish is come upon me because my life is yet whole in me 110 so i stood upon him and slew him because i was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen and i took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them hither unto my lord 111 then david took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewise all the men that were with him 112 and they mourned and wept and fasted until even for saul and for jonathan his son and for the people of the lord and for the house of israel because they were fallen by the sword 113 and david said unto the young man that told him whence art thou and he answered i am the son of a stranger an amalekite 114 and david said unto him how wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the lords anointed 115 and david called one of the young men and said go near and fall upon him and he smote him that he died 116 and david said unto him thy blood be upon thy head for thy mouth hath testified against thee saying i have slain the lords anointed 117 and david lamented with this lamentation over saul and over jonathan his son 118 also he bade them teach the children of judah the use of the bow behold it is written in the book of jasher 119 the beauty of israel is slain upon thy high places how are the mighty fallen 120 tell it not in gath publish it not in the streets of askelon lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph 121 ye mountains of gilboa let there be no dew neither let there be rain upon you nor fields of offerings for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away the shield of saul as though he had not been anointed with oil 122 from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bow of jonathan turned not back and the sword of saul returned not empty 123 saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles they were stronger than lions 124 ye daughters of israel weep over saul who clothed you in scarlet with other delights who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel 125 how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle o jonathan thou wast slain in thine high places 126 i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant hast thou been unto me thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of women 127 how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished 21 and it came to pass after this that david enquired of the lord saying shall i go up into any of the cities of judah and the lord said unto him go up and david said whither shall i go up and he said unto hebron 22 so david went up thither and his two wives also ahinoam the jezreelitess and abigail nabals wife the carmelite 23 and his men that were with him did david bring up every man with his household and they dwelt in the cities of hebron 24 and the men of judah came and there they anointed david king over the house of judah and they told david saying that the men of jabeshgilead were they that buried saul 25 and david sent messengers unto the men of jabeshgilead and said unto them blessed be ye of the lord that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord even unto saul and have buried him 26 and now the lord shew kindness and truth unto you and i also will requite you this kindness because ye have done this thing 27 therefore now let your hands be strengthened and be ye valiant for your master saul is dead and also the house of judah have anointed me king over them 28 but abner the son of ner captain of sauls host took ishbosheth the son of saul and brought him over to mahanaim 29 and made him king over gilead and over the ashurites and over jezreel and over ephraim and over benjamin and over all israel 210 ishbosheth sauls son was forty years old when he began to reign over israel and reigned two years but the house of judah followed david 211 and the time that david was king in hebron over the house of judah was seven years and six months 212 and abner the son of ner and the servants of ishbosheth the son of saul went out from mahanaim to gibeon 213 and joab the son of zeruiah and the servants of david went out and met together by the pool of gibeon and they sat down the one on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool 214 and abner said to joab let the young men now arise and play before us and joab said let them arise 215 then there arose and went over by number twelve of benjamin which pertained to ishbosheth the son of saul and twelve of the servants of david 216 and they caught every one his fellow by the head and thrust his sword in his fellows side so they fell down together wherefore that place was called helkathhazzurim which is in gibeon 217 and there was a very sore battle that day and abner was beaten and the men of israel before the servants of david 218 and there were three sons of zeruiah there joab and abishai and asahel and asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe 219 and asahel pursued after abner and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following abner 220 then abner looked behind him and said art thou asahel and he answered i am 221 and abner said to him turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left and lay thee hold on one of the young men and take thee his armour but asahel would not turn aside from following of him 222 and abner said again to asahel turn thee aside from following me wherefore should i smite thee to the ground how then should i hold up my face to joab thy brother 223 howbeit he refused to turn aside wherefore abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib that the spear came out behind him and he fell down there and died in the same place and it came to pass that as many as came to the place where asahel fell down and died stood still 224 joab also and abishai pursued after abner and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of ammah that lieth before giah by the way of the wilderness of gibeon 225 and the children of benjamin gathered themselves together after abner and became one troop and stood on the top of an hill 226 then abner called to joab and said shall the sword devour for ever knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end how long shall it be then ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren 227 and joab said as god liveth unless thou hadst spoken surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother 228 so joab blew a trumpet and all the people stood still and pursued after israel no more neither fought they any more 229 and abner and his men walked all that night through the plain and passed over jordan and went through all bithron and they came to mahanaim 230 and joab returned from following abner and when he had gathered all the people together there lacked of davids servants nineteen men and asahel 231 but the servants of david had smitten of benjamin and of abners men so that three hundred and threescore men died 232 and they took up asahel and buried him in the sepulchre of his father which was in bethlehem and joab and his men went all night and they came to hebron at break of day 31 now there was long war between the house of saul and the house of david but david waxed stronger and stronger and the house of saul waxed weaker and weaker 32 and unto david were sons born in hebron and his firstborn was amnon of ahinoam the jezreelitess 33 and his second chileab of abigail the wife of nabal the carmelite and the third absalom the son of maacah the daughter of talmai king of geshur 34 and the fourth adonijah the son of haggith and the fifth shephatiah the son of abital 35 and the sixth ithream by eglah davids wife these were born to david in hebron 36 and it came to pass while there was war between the house of saul and the house of david that abner made himself strong for the house of saul 37 and saul had a concubine whose name was rizpah the daughter of aiah and ishbosheth said to abner wherefore hast thou gone in unto my fathers concubine 38 then was abner very wroth for the words of ishbosheth and said am i a dogs head which against judah do shew kindness this day unto the house of saul thy father to his brethren and to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand of david that thou chargest me to day with a fault concerning this woman 39 so do god to abner and more also except as the lord hath sworn to david even so i do to him 310 to translate the kingdom from the house of saul and to set up the throne of david over israel and over judah from dan even to beersheba 311 and he could not answer abner a word again because he feared him 312 and abner sent messengers to david on his behalf saying whose is the land saying also make thy league with me and behold my hand shall be with thee to bring about all israel unto thee 313 and he said well i will make a league with thee but one thing i require of thee that is thou shalt not see my face except thou first bring michal sauls daughter when thou comest to see my face 314 and david sent messengers to ishbosheth sauls son saying deliver me my wife michal which i espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the philistines 315 and ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband even from phaltiel the son of laish 316 and her husband went with her along weeping behind her to bahurim then said abner unto him go return and he returned 317 and abner had communication with the elders of israel saying ye sought for david in times past to be king over you 318 now then do it for the lord hath spoken of david saying by the hand of my servant david i will save my people israel out of the hand of the philistines and out of the hand of all their enemies 319 and abner also spake in the ears of benjamin and abner went also to speak in the ears of david in hebron all that seemed good to israel and that seemed good to the whole house of benjamin 320 so abner came to david to hebron and twenty men with him and david made abner and the men that were with him a feast 321 and abner said unto david i will arise and go and will gather all israel unto my lord the king that they may make a league with thee and that thou mayest reign over all that thine heart desireth and david sent abner away and he went in peace 322 and behold the servants of david and joab came from pursuing a troop and brought in a great spoil with them but abner was not with david in hebron for he had sent him away and he was gone in peace 323 when joab and all the host that was with him were come they told joab saying abner the son of ner came to the king and he hath sent him away and he is gone in peace 324 then joab came to the king and said what hast thou done behold abner came unto thee why is it that thou hast sent him away and he is quite gone 325 thou knowest abner the son of ner that he came to deceive thee and to know thy going out and thy coming in and to know all that thou doest 326 and when joab was come out from david he sent messengers after abner which brought him again from the well of sirah but david knew it not 327 and when abner was returned to hebron joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly and smote him there under the fifth rib that he died for the blood of asahel his brother 328 and afterward when david heard it he said i and my kingdom are guiltless before the lord for ever from the blood of abner the son of ner 329 let it rest on the head of joab and on all his fathers house and let there not fail from the house of joab one that hath an issue or that is a leper or that leaneth on a staff or that falleth on the sword or that lacketh bread 330 so joab and abishai his brother slew abner because he had slain their brother asahel at gibeon in the battle 331 and david said to joab and to all the people that were with him rend your clothes and gird you with sackcloth and mourn before abner and king david himself followed the bier 332 and they buried abner in hebron and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of abner and all the people wept 333 and the king lamented over abner and said died abner as a fool dieth 334 thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters as a man falleth before wicked men so fellest thou and all the people wept again over him 335 and when all the people came to cause david to eat meat while it was yet day david sware saying so do god to me and more also if i taste bread or ought else till the sun be down 336 and all the people took notice of it and it pleased them as whatsoever the king did pleased all the people 337 for all the people and all israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay abner the son of ner 338 and the king said unto his servants know ye not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in israel 339 and i am this day weak though anointed king and these men the sons of zeruiah be too hard for me the lord shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness 41 and when sauls son heard that abner was dead in hebron his hands were feeble and all the israelites were troubled 42 and sauls son had two men that were captains of bands the name of the one was baanah and the name of the other rechab the sons of rimmon a beerothite of the children of benjamin for beeroth also was reckoned to benjamin 43 and the beerothites fled to gittaim and were sojourners there until this day 44 and jonathan sauls son had a son that was lame of his feet he was five years old when the tidings came of saul and jonathan out of jezreel and his nurse took him up and fled and it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell and became lame and his name was mephibosheth 45 and the sons of rimmon the beerothite rechab and baanah went and came about the heat of the day to the house of ishbosheth who lay on a bed at noon 46 and they came thither into the midst of the house as though they would have fetched wheat and they smote him under the fifth rib and rechab and baanah his brother escaped 47 for when they came into the house he lay on his bed in his bedchamber and they smote him and slew him and beheaded him and took his head and gat them away through the plain all night 48 and they brought the head of ishbosheth unto david to hebron and said to the king behold the head of ishbosheth the son of saul thine enemy which sought thy life and the lord hath avenged my lord the king this day of saul and of his seed 49 and david answered rechab and baanah his brother the sons of rimmon the beerothite and said unto them as the lord liveth who hath redeemed my soul out of all adversity 410 when one told me saying behold saul is dead thinking to have brought good tidings i took hold of him and slew him in ziklag who thought that i would have given him a reward for his tidings 411 how much more when wicked men have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed shall i not therefore now require his blood of your hand and take you away from the earth 412 and david commanded his young men and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hanged them up over the pool in hebron but they took the head of ishbosheth and buried it in the sepulchre of abner in hebron 51 then came all the tribes of israel to david unto hebron and spake saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh 52 also in time past when saul was king over us thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord said to thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be a captain over israel 53 so all the elders of israel came to the king to hebron and king david made a league with them in hebron before the lord and they anointed david king over israel 54 david was thirty years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years 55 in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and in jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all israel and judah 56 and the king and his men went to jerusalem unto the jebusites the inhabitants of the land which spake unto david saying except thou take away the blind and the lame thou shalt not come in hither thinking david cannot come in hither 57 nevertheless david took the strong hold of zion the same is the city of david 58 and david said on that day whosoever getteth up to the gutter and smiteth the jebusites and the lame and the blind that are hated of davids soul he shall be chief and captain wherefore they said the blind and the lame shall not come into the house 59 so david dwelt in the fort and called it the city of david and david built round about from millo and inward 510 and david went on and grew great and the lord god of hosts was with him 511 and hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and cedar trees and carpenters and masons and they built david an house 512 and david perceived that the lord had established him king over israel and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people israels sake 513 and david took him more concubines and wives out of jerusalem after he was come from hebron and there were yet sons and daughters born to david 514 and these be the names of those that were born unto him in jerusalem shammuah and shobab and nathan and solomon 515 ibhar also and elishua and nepheg and japhia 516 and elishama and eliada and eliphalet 517 but when the philistines heard that they had anointed david king over israel all the philistines came up to seek david and david heard of it and went down to the hold 518 the philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim 519 and david enquired of the lord saying shall i go up to the philistines wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord said unto david go up for i will doubtless deliver the philistines into thine hand 520 and david came to baalperazim and david smote them there and said the lord hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me as the breach of waters therefore he called the name of that place baalperazim 521 and there they left their images and david and his men burned them 522 and the philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim 523 and when david enquired of the lord he said thou shalt not go up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees 524 and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt bestir thyself for then shall the lord go out before thee to smite the host of the philistines 525 and david did so as the lord had commanded him and smote the philistines from geba until thou come to gazer 61 again david gathered together all the chosen men of israel thirty thousand 62 and david arose and went with all the people that were with him from baale of judah to bring up from thence the ark of god whose name is called by the name of the lord of hosts that dwelleth between the cherubims 63 and they set the ark of god upon a new cart and brought it out of the house of abinadab that was in gibeah and uzzah and ahio the sons of abinadab drave the new cart 64 and they brought it out of the house of abinadab which was at gibeah accompanying the ark of god and ahio went before the ark 65 and david and all the house of israel played before the lord on all manner of instruments made of fir wood even on harps and on psalteries and on timbrels and on cornets and on cymbals 66 and when they came to nachons threshingfloor uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of god and took hold of it for the oxen shook it 67 and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzzah and god smote him there for his error and there he died by the ark of god 68 and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon uzzah and he called the name of the place perezuzzah to this day 69 and david was afraid of the lord that day and said how shall the ark of the lord come to me 610 so david would not remove the ark of the lord unto him into the city of david but david carried it aside into the house of obededom the gittite 611 and the ark of the lord continued in the house of obededom the gittite three months and the lord blessed obededom and all his household 612 and it was told king david saying the lord hath blessed the house of obededom and all that pertaineth unto him because of the ark of god so david went and brought up the ark of god from the house of obededom into the city of david with gladness 613 and it was so that when they that bare the ark of the lord had gone six paces he sacrificed oxen and fatlings 614 and david danced before the lord with all his might and david was girded with a linen ephod 615 so david and all the house of israel brought up the ark of the lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet 616 and as the ark of the lord came into the city of david michal sauls daughter looked through a window and saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord and she despised him in her heart 617 and they brought in the ark of the lord and set it in his place in the midst of the tabernacle that david had pitched for it and david offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the lord 618 and as soon as david had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord of hosts 619 and he dealt among all the people even among the whole multitude of israel as well to the women as men to every one a cake of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine so all the people departed every one to his house 620 then david returned to bless his household and michal the daughter of saul came out to meet david and said how glorious was the king of israel to day who uncovered himself to day in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovereth himself 621 and david said unto michal it was before the lord which chose me before thy father and before all his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the lord over israel therefore will i play before the lord 622 and i will yet be more vile than thus and will be base in mine own sight and of the maidservants which thou hast spoken of of them shall i be had in honour 623 therefore michal the daughter of saul had no child unto the day of her death 71 and it came to pass when the king sat in his house and the lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies 72 that the king said unto nathan the prophet see now i dwell in an house of cedar but the ark of god dwelleth within curtains 73 and nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heart for the lord is with thee 74 and it came to pass that night that the word of the lord came unto nathan saying 75 go and tell my servant david thus saith the lord shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in 76 whereas i have not dwelt in any house since the time that i brought up the children of israel out of egypt even to this day but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle 77 in all the places wherein i have walked with all the children of israel spake i a word with any of the tribes of israel whom i commanded to feed my people israel saying why build ye not me an house of cedar 78 now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote from following the sheep to be ruler over my people over israel 79 and i was with thee whithersoever thou wentest and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth 710 moreover i will appoint a place for my people israel and will plant them that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more as beforetime 711 and as since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies also the lord telleth thee that he will make thee an house 712 and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers i will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and i will establish his kingdom 713 he shall build an house for my name and i will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever 714 i will be his father and he shall be my son if he commit iniquity i will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men 715 but my mercy shall not depart away from him as i took it from saul whom i put away before thee 716 and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee thy throne shall be established for ever 717 according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david 718 then went king david in and sat before the lord and he said who am i o lord god and what is my house that thou hast brought me hitherto 719 and this was yet a small thing in thy sight o lord god but thou hast spoken also of thy servants house for a great while to come and is this the manner of man o lord god 720 and what can david say more unto thee for thou lord god knowest thy servant 721 for thy words sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things to make thy servant know them 722 wherefore thou art great o lord god for there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears 723 and what one nation in the earth is like thy people even like israel whom god went to redeem for a people to himself and to make him a name and to do for you great things and terrible for thy land before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from egypt from the nations and their gods 724 for thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people israel to be a people unto thee for ever and thou lord art become their god 725 and now o lord god the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house establish it for ever and do as thou hast said 726 and let thy name be magnified for ever saying the lord of hosts is the god over israel and let the house of thy servant david be established before thee 727 for thou o lord of hosts god of israel hast revealed to thy servant saying i will build thee an house therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee 728 and now o lord god thou art that god and thy words be true and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant 729 therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may continue for ever before thee for thou o lord god hast spoken it and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever 81 and after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and david took methegammah out of the hand of the philistines 82 and he smote moab and measured them with a line casting them down to the ground even with two lines measured he to put to death and with one full line to keep alive and so the moabites became davids servants and brought gifts 83 david smote also hadadezer the son of rehob king of zobah as he went to recover his border at the river euphrates 84 and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen and david houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them for an hundred chariots 85 and when the syrians of damascus came to succour hadadezer king of zobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men 86 then david put garrisons in syria of damascus and the syrians became servants to david and brought gifts and the lord preserved david whithersoever he went 87 and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadadezer and brought them to jerusalem 88 and from betah and from berothai cities of hadadezer king david took exceeding much brass 89 when toi king of hamath heard that david had smitten all the host of hadadezer 810 then toi sent joram his son unto king david to salute him and to bless him because he had fought against hadadezer and smitten him for hadadezer had wars with toi and joram brought with him vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brass 811 which also king david did dedicate unto the lord with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued 812 of syria and of moab and of the children of ammon and of the philistines and of amalek and of the spoil of hadadezer son of rehob king of zobah 813 and david gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the syrians in the valley of salt being eighteen thousand men 814 and he put garrisons in edom throughout all edom put he garrisons and all they of edom became davids servants and the lord preserved david whithersoever he went 815 and david reigned over all israel and david executed judgment and justice unto all his people 816 and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder 817 and zadok the son of ahitub and ahimelech the son of abiathar were the priests and seraiah was the scribe 818 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over both the cherethites and the pelethites and davids sons were chief rulers 91 and david said is there yet any that is left of the house of saul that i may shew him kindness for jonathans sake 92 and there was of the house of saul a servant whose name was ziba and when they had called him unto david the king said unto him art thou ziba and he said thy servant is he 93 and the king said is there not yet any of the house of saul that i may shew the kindness of god unto him and ziba said unto the king jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on his feet 94 and the king said unto him where is he and ziba said unto the king behold he is in the house of machir the son of ammiel in lodebar 95 then king david sent and fetched him out of the house of machir the son of ammiel from lodebar 96 now when mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul was come unto david he fell on his face and did reverence and david said mephibosheth and he answered behold thy servant 97 and david said unto him fear not for i will surely shew thee kindness for jonathan thy fathers sake and will restore thee all the land of saul thy father and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually 98 and he bowed himself and said what is thy servant that thou shouldest look upon such a dead dog as i am 99 then the king called to ziba sauls servant and said unto him i have given unto thy masters son all that pertained to saul and to all his house 910 thou therefore and thy sons and thy servants shall till the land for him and thou shalt bring in the fruits that thy masters son may have food to eat but mephibosheth thy masters son shall eat bread alway at my table now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants 911 then said ziba unto the king according to all that my lord the king hath commanded his servant so shall thy servant do as for mephibosheth said the king he shall eat at my table as one of the kings sons 912 and mephibosheth had a young son whose name was micha and all that dwelt in the house of ziba were servants unto mephibosheth 913 so mephibosheth dwelt in jerusalem for he did eat continually at the kings table and was lame on both his feet 101 and it came to pass after this that the king of the children of ammon died and hanun his son reigned in his stead 102 then said david i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash as his father shewed kindness unto me and david sent to comfort him by the hand of his servants for his father and davids servants came into the land of the children of ammon 103 and the princes of the children of ammon said unto hanun their lord thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee hath not david rather sent his servants unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it 104 wherefore hanun took davids servants and shaved off the one half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks and sent them away 105 when they told it unto david he sent to meet them because the men were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return 106 and when the children of ammon saw that they stank before david the children of ammon sent and hired the syrians of bethrehob and the syrians of zoba twenty thousand footmen and of king maacah a thousand men and of ishtob twelve thousand men 107 and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men 108 and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array at the entering in of the gate and the syrians of zoba and of rehob and ishtob and maacah were by themselves in the field 109 when joab saw that the front of the battle was against him before and behind he chose of all the choice men of israel and put them in array against the syrians 1010 and the rest of the people he delivered into the hand of abishai his brother that he might put them in array against the children of ammon 1011 and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will come and help thee 1012 be of good courage and let us play the men for our people and for the cities of our god and the lord do that which seemeth him good 1013 and joab drew nigh and the people that were with him unto the battle against the syrians and they fled before him 1014 and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled then fled they also before abishai and entered into the city so joab returned from the children of ammon and came to jerusalem 1015 and when the syrians saw that they were smitten before israel they gathered themselves together 1016 and hadarezer sent and brought out the syrians that were beyond the river and they came to helam and shobach the captain of the host of hadarezer went before them 1017 and when it was told david he gathered all israel together and passed over jordan and came to helam and the syrians set themselves in array against david and fought with him 1018 and the syrians fled before israel and david slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the syrians and forty thousand horsemen and smote shobach the captain of their host who died there 1019 and when all the kings that were servants to hadarezer saw that they were smitten before israel they made peace with israel and served them so the syrians feared to help the children of ammon any more 111 and it came to pass after the year was expired at the time when kings go forth to battle that david sent joab and his servants with him and all israel and they destroyed the children of ammon and besieged rabbah but david tarried still at jerusalem 112 and it came to pass in an eveningtide that david arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the kings house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon 113 and david sent and enquired after the woman and one said is not this bathsheba the daughter of eliam the wife of uriah the hittite 114 and david sent messengers and took her and she came in unto him and he lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned unto her house 115 and the woman conceived and sent and told david and said i am with child 116 and david sent to joab saying send me uriah the hittite and joab sent uriah to david 117 and when uriah was come unto him david demanded of him how joab did and how the people did and how the war prospered 118 and david said to uriah go down to thy house and wash thy feet and uriah departed out of the kings house and there followed him a mess of meat from the king 119 but uriah slept at the door of the kings house with all the servants of his lord and went not down to his house 1110 and when they had told david saying uriah went not down unto his house david said unto uriah camest thou not from thy journey why then didst thou not go down unto thine house 1111 and uriah said unto david the ark and israel and judah abide in tents and my lord joab and the servants of my lord are encamped in the open fields shall i then go into mine house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife as thou livest and as thy soul liveth i will not do this thing 1112 and david said to uriah tarry here to day also and to morrow i will let thee depart so uriah abode in jerusalem that day and the morrow 1113 and when david had called him he did eat and drink before him and he made him drunk and at even he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord but went not down to his house 1114 and it came to pass in the morning that david wrote a letter to joab and sent it by the hand of uriah 1115 and he wrote in the letter saying set ye uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire ye from him that he may be smitten and die 1116 and it came to pass when joab observed the city that he assigned uriah unto a place where he knew that valiant men were 1117 and the men of the city went out and fought with joab and there fell some of the people of the servants of david and uriah the hittite died also 1118 then joab sent and told david all the things concerning the war 1119 and charged the messenger saying when thou hast made an end of telling the matters of the war unto the king 1120 and if so be that the kings wrath arise and he say unto thee wherefore approached ye so nigh unto the city when ye did fight knew ye not that they would shoot from the wall 1121 who smote abimelech the son of jerubbesheth did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall that he died in thebez why went ye nigh the wall then say thou thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also 1122 so the messenger went and came and shewed david all that joab had sent him for 1123 and the messenger said unto david surely the men prevailed against us and came out unto us into the field and we were upon them even unto the entering of the gate 1124 and the shooters shot from off the wall upon thy servants and some of the kings servants be dead and thy servant uriah the hittite is dead also 1125 then david said unto the messenger thus shalt thou say unto joab let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth one as well as another make thy battle more strong against the city and overthrow it and encourage thou him 1126 and when the wife of uriah heard that uriah her husband was dead she mourned for her husband 1127 and when the mourning was past david sent and fetched her to his house and she became his wife and bare him a son but the thing that david had done displeased the lord 121 and the lord sent nathan unto david and he came unto him and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor 122 the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds 123 but the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished up and it grew up together with him and with his children it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter 124 and there came a traveller unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor mans lamb and dressed it for the man that was come to him 125 and davids anger was greatly kindled against the man and he said to nathan as the lord liveth the man that hath done this thing shall surely die 126 and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity 127 and nathan said to david thou art the man thus saith the lord god of israel i anointed thee king over israel and i delivered thee out of the hand of saul 128 and i gave thee thy masters house and thy masters wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of israel and of judah and if that had been too little i would moreover have given unto thee such and such things 129 wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the lord to do evil in his sight thou hast killed uriah the hittite with the sword and hast taken his wife to be thy wife and hast slain him with the sword of the children of ammon 1210 now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house because thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of uriah the hittite to be thy wife 1211 thus saith the lord behold i will raise up evil against thee out of thine own house and i will take thy wives before thine eyes and give them unto thy neighbour and he shall lie with thy wives in the sight of this sun 1212 for thou didst it secretly but i will do this thing before all israel and before the sun 1213 and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord and nathan said unto david the lord also hath put away thy sin thou shalt not die 1214 howbeit because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the lord to blaspheme the child also that is born unto thee shall surely die 1215 and nathan departed unto his house and the lord struck the child that uriahs wife bare unto david and it was very sick 1216 david therefore besought god for the child and david fasted and went in and lay all night upon the earth 1217 and the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the earth but he would not neither did he eat bread with them 1218 and it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died and the servants of david feared to tell him that the child was dead for they said behold while the child was yet alive we spake unto him and he would not hearken unto our voice how will he then vex himself if we tell him that the child is dead 1219 but when david saw that his servants whispered david perceived that the child was dead therefore david said unto his servants is the child dead and they said he is dead 1220 then david arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his apparel and came into the house of the lord and worshipped then he came to his own house and when he required they set bread before him and he did eat 1221 then said his servants unto him what thing is this that thou hast done thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive but when the child was dead thou didst rise and eat bread 1222 and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the child may live 1223 but now he is dead wherefore should i fast can i bring him back again i shall go to him but he shall not return to me 1224 and david comforted bathsheba his wife and went in unto her and lay with her and she bare a son and he called his name solomon and the lord loved him 1225 and he sent by the hand of nathan the prophet and he called his name jedidiah because of the lord 1226 and joab fought against rabbah of the children of ammon and took the royal city 1227 and joab sent messengers to david and said i have fought against rabbah and have taken the city of waters 1228 now therefore gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it lest i take the city and it be called after my name 1229 and david gathered all the people together and went to rabbah and fought against it and took it 1230 and he took their kings crown from off his head the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones and it was set on davids head and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance 1231 and he brought forth the people that were therein and put them under saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron and made them pass through the brickkiln and thus did he unto all the cities of the children of ammon so david and all the people returned unto jerusalem 131 and it came to pass after this that absalom the son of david had a fair sister whose name was tamar and amnon the son of david loved her 132 and amnon was so vexed that he fell sick for his sister tamar for she was a virgin and amnon thought it hard for him to do anything to her 133 but amnon had a friend whose name was jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother and jonadab was a very subtil man 134 and he said unto him why art thou being the kings son lean from day to day wilt thou not tell me and amnon said unto him i love tamar my brother absaloms sister 135 and jonadab said unto him lay thee down on thy bed and make thyself sick and when thy father cometh to see thee say unto him i pray thee let my sister tamar come and give me meat and dress the meat in my sight that i may see it and eat it at her hand 136 so amnon lay down and made himself sick and when the king was come to see him amnon said unto the king i pray thee let tamar my sister come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that i may eat at her hand 137 then david sent home to tamar saying go now to thy brother amnons house and dress him meat 138 so tamar went to her brother amnons house and he was laid down and she took flour and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and did bake the cakes 139 and she took a pan and poured them out before him but he refused to eat and amnon said have out all men from me and they went out every man from him 1310 and amnon said unto tamar bring the meat into the chamber that i may eat of thine hand and tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the chamber to amnon her brother 1311 and when she had brought them unto him to eat he took hold of her and said unto her come lie with me my sister 1312 and she answered him nay my brother do not force me for no such thing ought to be done in israel do not thou this folly 1313 and i whither shall i cause my shame to go and as for thee thou shalt be as one of the fools in israel now therefore i pray thee speak unto the king for he will not withhold me from thee 1314 howbeit he would not hearken unto her voice but being stronger than she forced her and lay with her 1315 then amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred wherewith he hated her was greater than the love wherewith he had loved her and amnon said unto her arise be gone 1316 and she said unto him there is no cause this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me but he would not hearken unto her 1317 then he called his servant that ministered unto him and said put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her 1318 and she had a garment of divers colours upon her for with such robes were the kings daughters that were virgins apparelled then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her 1319 and tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of divers colours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on crying 1320 and absalom her brother said unto her hath amnon thy brother been with thee but hold now thy peace my sister he is thy brother regard not this thing so tamar remained desolate in her brother absaloms house 1321 but when king david heard of all these things he was very wroth 1322 and absalom spake unto his brother amnon neither good nor bad for absalom hated amnon because he had forced his sister tamar 1323 and it came to pass after two full years that absalom had sheepshearers in baalhazor which is beside ephraim and absalom invited all the kings sons 1324 and absalom came to the king and said behold now thy servant hath sheepshearers let the king i beseech thee and his servants go with thy servant 1325 and the king said to absalom nay my son let us not all now go lest we be chargeable unto thee and he pressed him howbeit he would not go but blessed him 1326 then said absalom if not i pray thee let my brother amnon go with us and the king said unto him why should he go with thee 1327 but absalom pressed him that he let amnon and all the kings sons go with him 1328 now absalom had commanded his servants saying mark ye now when amnons heart is merry with wine and when i say unto you smite amnon then kill him fear not have not i commanded you be courageous and be valiant 1329 and the servants of absalom did unto amnon as absalom had commanded then all the kings sons arose and every man gat him up upon his mule and fled 1330 and it came to pass while they were in the way that tidings came to david saying absalom hath slain all the kings sons and there is not one of them left 1331 then the king arose and tare his garments and lay on the earth and all his servants stood by with their clothes rent 1332 and jonadab the son of shimeah davids brother answered and said let not my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men the kings sons for amnon only is dead for by the appointment of absalom this hath been determined from the day that he forced his sister tamar 1333 now therefore let not my lord the king take the thing to his heart to think that all the kings sons are dead for amnon only is dead 1334 but absalom fled and the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked and behold there came much people by the way of the hill side behind him 1335 and jonadab said unto the king behold the kings sons come as thy servant said so it is 1336 and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of speaking that behold the kings sons came and lifted up their voice and wept and the king also and all his servants wept very sore 1337 but absalom fled and went to talmai the son of ammihud king of geshur and david mourned for his son every day 1338 so absalom fled and went to geshur and was there three years 1339 and the soul of king david longed to go forth unto absalom for he was comforted concerning amnon seeing he was dead 141 now joab the son of zeruiah perceived that the kings heart was toward absalom 142 and joab sent to tekoah and fetched thence a wise woman and said unto her i pray thee feign thyself to be a mourner and put on now mourning apparel and anoint not thyself with oil but be as a woman that had a long time mourned for the dead 143 and come to the king and speak on this manner unto him so joab put the words in her mouth 144 and when the woman of tekoah spake to the king she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance and said help o king 145 and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered i am indeed a widow woman and mine husband is dead 146 and thy handmaid had two sons and they two strove together in the field and there was none to part them but the one smote the other and slew him 147 and behold the whole family is risen against thine handmaid and they said deliver him that smote his brother that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew and we will destroy the heir also and so they shall quench my coal which is left and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth 148 and the king said unto the woman go to thine house and i will give charge concerning thee 149 and the woman of tekoah said unto the king my lord o king the iniquity be on me and on my fathers house and the king and his throne be guiltless 1410 and the king said whoever saith ought unto thee bring him to me and he shall not touch thee any more 1411 then said she i pray thee let the king remember the lord thy god that thou wouldest not suffer the revengers of blood to destroy any more lest they destroy my son and he said as the lord liveth there shall not one hair of thy son fall to the earth 1412 then the woman said let thine handmaid i pray thee speak one word unto my lord the king and he said say on 1413 and the woman said wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of god for the king doth speak this thing as one which is faulty in that the king doth not fetch home again his banished 1414 for we must needs die and are as water spilt on the ground which cannot be gathered up again neither doth god respect any person yet doth he devise means that his banished be not expelled from him 1415 now therefore that i am come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king it is because the people have made me afraid and thy handmaid said i will now speak unto the king it may be that the king will perform the request of his handmaid 1416 for the king will hear to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of god 1417 then thine handmaid said the word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable for as an angel of god so is my lord the king to discern good and bad therefore the lord thy god will be with thee 1418 then the king answered and said unto the woman hide not from me i pray thee the thing that i shall ask thee and the woman said let my lord the king now speak 1419 and the king said is not the hand of joab with thee in all this and the woman answered and said as thy soul liveth my lord the king none can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken for thy servant joab he bade me and he put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid 1420 to fetch about this form of speech hath thy servant joab done this thing and my lord is wise according to the wisdom of an angel of god to know all things that are in the earth 1421 and the king said unto joab behold now i have done this thing go therefore bring the young man absalom again 1422 and joab fell to the ground on his face and bowed himself and thanked the king and joab said to day thy servant knoweth that i have found grace in thy sight my lord o king in that the king hath fulfilled the request of his servant 1423 so joab arose and went to geshur and brought absalom to jerusalem 1424 and the king said let him turn to his own house and let him not see my face so absalom returned to his own house and saw not the kings face 1425 but in all israel there was none to be so much praised as absalom for his beauty from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him 1426 and when he polled his head for it was at every years end that he polled it because the hair was heavy on him therefore he polled it he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the kings weight 1427 and unto absalom there were born three sons and one daughter whose name was tamar she was a woman of a fair countenance 1428 so absalom dwelt two full years in jerusalem and saw not the kings face 1429 therefore absalom sent for joab to have sent him to the king but he would not come to him and when he sent again the second time he would not come 1430 therefore he said unto his servants see joabs field is near mine and he hath barley there go and set it on fire and absaloms servants set the field on fire 1431 then joab arose and came to absalom unto his house and said unto him wherefore have thy servants set my field on fire 1432 and absalom answered joab behold i sent unto thee saying come hither that i may send thee to the king to say wherefore am i come from geshur it had been good for me to have been there still now therefore let me see the kings face and if there be any iniquity in me let him kill me 1433 so joab came to the king and told him and when he had called for absalom he came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king and the king kissed absalom 151 and it came to pass after this that absalom prepared him chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him 152 and absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate and it was so that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment then absalom called unto him and said of what city art thou and he said thy servant is of one of the tribes of israel 153 and absalom said unto him see thy matters are good and right but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee 154 absalom said moreover oh that i were made judge in the land that every man which hath any suit or cause might come unto me and i would do him justice 155 and it was so that when any man came nigh to him to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him 156 and on this manner did absalom to all israel that came to the king for judgment so absalom stole the hearts of the men of israel 157 and it came to pass after forty years that absalom said unto the king i pray thee let me go and pay my vow which i have vowed unto the lord in hebron 158 for thy servant vowed a vow while i abode at geshur in syria saying if the lord shall bring me again indeed to jerusalem then i will serve the lord 159 and the king said unto him go in peace so he arose and went to hebron 1510 but absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of israel saying as soon as ye hear the sound of the trumpet then ye shall say absalom reigneth in hebron 1511 and with absalom went two hundred men out of jerusalem that were called and they went in their simplicity and they knew not any thing 1512 and absalom sent for ahithophel the gilonite davids counsellor from his city even from giloh while he offered sacrifices and the conspiracy was strong for the people increased continually with absalom 1513 and there came a messenger to david saying the hearts of the men of israel are after absalom 1514 and david said unto all his servants that were with him at jerusalem arise and let us flee for we shall not else escape from absalom make speed to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword 1515 and the kings servants said unto the king behold thy servants are ready to do whatsoever my lord the king shall appoint 1516 and the king went forth and all his household after him and the king left ten women which were concubines to keep the house 1517 and the king went forth and all the people after him and tarried in a place that was far off 1518 and all his servants passed on beside him and all the cherethites and all the pelethites and all the gittites six hundred men which came after him from gath passed on before the king 1519 then said the king to ittai the gittite wherefore goest thou also with us return to thy place and abide with the king for thou art a stranger and also an exile 1520 whereas thou camest but yesterday should i this day make thee go up and down with us seeing i go whither i may return thou and take back thy brethren mercy and truth be with thee 1521 and ittai answered the king and said as the lord liveth and as my lord the king liveth surely in what place my lord the king shall be whether in death or life even there also will thy servant be 1522 and david said to ittai go and pass over and ittai the gittite passed over and all his men and all the little ones that were with him 1523 and all the country wept with a loud voice and all the people passed over the king also himself passed over the brook kidron and all the people passed over toward the way of the wilderness 1524 and lo zadok also and all the levites were with him bearing the ark of the covenant of god and they set down the ark of god and abiathar went up until all the people had done passing out of the city 1525 and the king said unto zadok carry back the ark of god into the city if i shall find favour in the eyes of the lord he will bring me again and shew me both it and his habitation 1526 but if he thus say i have no delight in thee behold here am i let him do to me as seemeth good unto him 1527 the king said also unto zadok the priest art not thou a seer return into the city in peace and your two sons with you ahimaaz thy son and jonathan the son of abiathar 1528 see i will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until there come word from you to certify me 1529 zadok therefore and abiathar carried the ark of god again to jerusalem and they tarried there 1530 and david went up by the ascent of mount olivet and wept as he went up and had his head covered and he went barefoot and all the people that was with him covered every man his head and they went up weeping as they went up 1531 and one told david saying ahithophel is among the conspirators with absalom and david said o lord i pray thee turn the counsel of ahithophel into foolishness 1532 and it came to pass that when david was come to the top of the mount where he worshipped god behold hushai the archite came to meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head 1533 unto whom david said if thou passest on with me then thou shalt be a burden unto me 1534 but if thou return to the city and say unto absalom i will be thy servant o king as i have been thy fathers servant hitherto so will i now also be thy servant then mayest thou for me defeat the counsel of ahithophel 1535 and hast thou not there with thee zadok and abiathar the priests therefore it shall be that what thing soever thou shalt hear out of the kings house thou shalt tell it to zadok and abiathar the priests 1536 behold they have there with them their two sons ahimaaz zadoks son and jonathan abiathars son and by them ye shall send unto me every thing that ye can hear 1537 so hushai davids friend came into the city and absalom came into jerusalem 161 and when david was a little past the top of the hill behold ziba the servant of mephibosheth met him with a couple of asses saddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and an hundred bunches of raisins and an hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of wine 162 and the king said unto ziba what meanest thou by these and ziba said the asses be for the kings household to ride on and the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat and the wine that such as be faint in the wilderness may drink 163 and the king said and where is thy masters son and ziba said unto the king behold he abideth at jerusalem for he said to day shall the house of israel restore me the kingdom of my father 164 then said the king to ziba behold thine are all that pertained unto mephibosheth and ziba said i humbly beseech thee that i may find grace in thy sight my lord o king 165 and when king david came to bahurim behold thence came out a man of the family of the house of saul whose name was shimei the son of gera he came forth and cursed still as he came 166 and he cast stones at david and at all the servants of king david and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left 167 and thus said shimei when he cursed come out come out thou bloody man and thou man of belial 168 the lord hath returned upon thee all the blood of the house of saul in whose stead thou hast reigned and the lord hath delivered the kingdom into the hand of absalom thy son and behold thou art taken in thy mischief because thou art a bloody man 169 then said abishai the son of zeruiah unto the king why should this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over i pray thee and take off his head 1610 and the king said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah so let him curse because the lord hath said unto him curse david who shall then say wherefore hast thou done so 1611 and david said to abishai and to all his servants behold my son which came forth of my bowels seeketh my life how much more now may this benjamite do it let him alone and let him curse for the lord hath bidden him 1612 it may be that the lord will look on mine affliction and that the lord will requite me good for his cursing this day 1613 and as david and his men went by the way shimei went along on the hills side over against him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust 1614 and the king and all the people that were with him came weary and refreshed themselves there 1615 and absalom and all the people the men of israel came to jerusalem and ahithophel with him 1616 and it came to pass when hushai the archite davids friend was come unto absalom that hushai said unto absalom god save the king god save the king 1617 and absalom said to hushai is this thy kindness to thy friend why wentest thou not with thy friend 1618 and hushai said unto absalom nay but whom the lord and this people and all the men of israel choose his will i be and with him will i abide 1619 and again whom should i serve should i not serve in the presence of his son as i have served in thy fathers presence so will i be in thy presence 1620 then said absalom to ahithophel give counsel among you what we shall do 1621 and ahithophel said unto absalom go in unto thy fathers concubines which he hath left to keep the house and all israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father then shall the hands of all that are with thee be strong 1622 so they spread absalom a tent upon the top of the house and absalom went in unto his fathers concubines in the sight of all israel 1623 and the counsel of ahithophel which he counselled in those days was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of god so was all the counsel of ahithophel both with david and with absalom 171 moreover ahithophel said unto absalom let me now choose out twelve thousand men and i will arise and pursue after david this night 172 and i will come upon him while he is weary and weak handed and will make him afraid and all the people that are with him shall flee and i will smite the king only 173 and i will bring back all the people unto thee the man whom thou seekest is as if all returned so all the people shall be in peace 174 and the saying pleased absalom well and all the elders of israel 175 then said absalom call now hushai the archite also and let us hear likewise what he saith 176 and when hushai was come to absalom absalom spake unto him saying ahithophel hath spoken after this manner shall we do after his saying if not speak thou 177 and hushai said unto absalom the counsel that ahithophel hath given is not good at this time 178 for said hushai thou knowest thy father and his men that they be mighty men and they be chafed in their minds as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field and thy father is a man of war and will not lodge with the people 179 behold he is hid now in some pit or in some other place and it will come to pass when some of them be overthrown at the first that whosoever heareth it will say there is a slaughter among the people that follow absalom 1710 and he also that is valiant whose heart is as the heart of a lion shall utterly melt for all israel knoweth that thy father is a mighty man and they which be with him are valiant men 1711 therefore i counsel that all israel be generally gathered unto thee from dan even to beersheba as the sand that is by the sea for multitude and that thou go to battle in thine own person 1712 so shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found and we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground and of him and of all the men that are with him there shall not be left so much as one 1713 moreover if he be gotten into a city then shall all israel bring ropes to that city and we will draw it into the river until there be not one small stone found there 1714 and absalom and all the men of israel said the counsel of hushai the archite is better than the counsel of ahithophel for the lord had appointed to defeat the good counsel of ahithophel to the intent that the lord might bring evil upon absalom 1715 then said hushai unto zadok and to abiathar the priests thus and thus did ahithophel counsel absalom and the elders of israel and thus and thus have i counselled 1716 now therefore send quickly and tell david saying lodge not this night in the plains of the wilderness but speedily pass over lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him 1717 now jonathan and ahimaaz stayed by enrogel for they might not be seen to come into the city and a wench went and told them and they went and told king david 1718 nevertheless a lad saw them and told absalom but they went both of them away quickly and came to a mans house in bahurim which had a well in his court whither they went down 1719 and the woman took and spread a covering over the wells mouth and spread ground corn thereon and the thing was not known 1720 and when absaloms servants came to the woman to the house they said where is ahimaaz and jonathan and the woman said unto them they be gone over the brook of water and when they had sought and could not find them they returned to jerusalem 1721 and it came to pass after they were departed that they came up out of the well and went and told king david and said unto david arise and pass quickly over the water for thus hath ahithophel counselled against you 1722 then david arose and all the people that were with him and they passed over jordan by the morning light there lacked not one of them that was not gone over jordan 1723 and when ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed he saddled his ass and arose and gat him home to his house to his city and put his household in order and hanged himself and died and was buried in the sepulchre of his father 1724 then david came to mahanaim and absalom passed over jordan he and all the men of israel with him 1725 and absalom made amasa captain of the host instead of joab which amasa was a mans son whose name was ithra an israelite that went in to abigail the daughter of nahash sister to zeruiah joabs mother 1726 so israel and absalom pitched in the land of gilead 1727 and it came to pass when david was come to mahanaim that shobi the son of nahash of rabbah of the children of ammon and machir the son of ammiel of lodebar and barzillai the gileadite of rogelim 1728 brought beds and basons and earthen vessels and wheat and barley and flour and parched corn and beans and lentiles and parched pulse 1729 and honey and butter and sheep and cheese of kine for david and for the people that were with him to eat for they said the people is hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness 181 and david numbered the people that were with him and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them 182 and david sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of joab and a third part under the hand of abishai the son of zeruiah joabs brother and a third part under the hand of ittai the gittite and the king said unto the people i will surely go forth with you myself also 183 but the people answered thou shalt not go forth for if we flee away they will not care for us neither if half of us die will they care for us but now thou art worth ten thousand of us therefore now it is better that thou succour us out of the city 184 and the king said unto them what seemeth you best i will do and the king stood by the gate side and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands 185 and the king commanded joab and abishai and ittai saying deal gently for my sake with the young man even with absalom and all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning absalom 186 so the people went out into the field against israel and the battle was in the wood of ephraim 187 where the people of israel were slain before the servants of david and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men 188 for the battle was there scattered over the face of all the country and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword devoured 189 and absalom met the servants of david and absalom rode upon a mule and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak and his head caught hold of the oak and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth and the mule that was under him went away 1810 and a certain man saw it and told joab and said behold i saw absalom hanged in an oak 1811 and joab said unto the man that told him and behold thou sawest him and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground and i would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle 1812 and the man said unto joab though i should receive a thousand shekels of silver in mine hand yet would i not put forth mine hand against the kings son for in our hearing the king charged thee and abishai and ittai saying beware that none touch the young man absalom 1813 otherwise i should have wrought falsehood against mine own life for there is no matter hid from the king and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself against me 1814 then said joab i may not tarry thus with thee and he took three darts in his hand and thrust them through the heart of absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak 1815 and ten young men that bare joabs armour compassed about and smote absalom and slew him 1816 and joab blew the trumpet and the people returned from pursuing after israel for joab held back the people 1817 and they took absalom and cast him into a great pit in the wood and laid a very great heap of stones upon him and all israel fled every one to his tent 1818 now absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar which is in the kings dale for he said i have no son to keep my name in remembrance and he called the pillar after his own name and it is called unto this day absaloms place 1819 then said ahimaaz the son of zadok let me now run and bear the king tidings how that the lord hath avenged him of his enemies 1820 and joab said unto him thou shalt not bear tidings this day but thou shalt bear tidings another day but this day thou shalt bear no tidings because the kings son is dead 1821 then said joab to cushi go tell the king what thou hast seen and cushi bowed himself unto joab and ran 1822 then said ahimaaz the son of zadok yet again to joab but howsoever let me i pray thee also run after cushi and joab said wherefore wilt thou run my son seeing that thou hast no tidings ready 1823 but howsoever said he let me run and he said unto him run then ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran cushi 1824 and david sat between the two gates and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes and looked and behold a man running alone 1825 and the watchman cried and told the king and the king said if he be alone there is tidings in his mouth and he came apace and drew near 1826 and the watchman saw another man running and the watchman called unto the porter and said behold another man running alone and the king said he also bringeth tidings 1827 and the watchman said me thinketh the running of the foremost is like the running of ahimaaz the son of zadok and the king said he is a good man and cometh with good tidings 1828 and ahimaaz called and said unto the king all is well and he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king and said blessed be the lord thy god which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against my lord the king 1829 and the king said is the young man absalom safe and ahimaaz answered when joab sent the kings servant and me thy servant i saw a great tumult but i knew not what it was 1830 and the king said unto him turn aside and stand here and he turned aside and stood still 1831 and behold cushi came and cushi said tidings my lord the king for the lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee 1832 and the king said unto cushi is the young man absalom safe and cushi answered the enemies of my lord the king and all that rise against thee to do thee hurt be as that young man is 1833 and the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept and as he went thus he said o my son absalom my son my son absalom would god i had died for thee o absalom my son my son 191 and it was told joab behold the king weepeth and mourneth for absalom 192 and the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son 193 and the people gat them by stealth that day into the city as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle 194 but the king covered his face and the king cried with a loud voice o my son absalom o absalom my son my son 195 and joab came into the house to the king and said thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants which this day have saved thy life and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines 196 in that thou lovest thine enemies and hatest thy friends for thou hast declared this day that thou regardest neither princes nor servants for this day i perceive that if absalom had lived and all we had died this day then it had pleased thee well 197 now therefore arise go forth and speak comfortably unto thy servants for i swear by the lord if thou go not forth there will not tarry one with thee this night and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now 198 then the king arose and sat in the gate and they told unto all the people saying behold the king doth sit in the gate and all the people came before the king for israel had fled every man to his tent 199 and all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of israel saying the king saved us out of the hand of our enemies and he delivered us out of the hand of the philistines and now he is fled out of the land for absalom 1910 and absalom whom we anointed over us is dead in battle now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back 1911 and king david sent to zadok and to abiathar the priests saying speak unto the elders of judah saying why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house seeing the speech of all israel is come to the king even to his house 1912 ye are my brethren ye are my bones and my flesh wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king 1913 and say ye to amasa art thou not of my bone and of my flesh god do so to me and more also if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of joab 1914 and he bowed the heart of all the men of judah even as the heart of one man so that they sent this word unto the king return thou and all thy servants 1915 so the king returned and came to jordan and judah came to gilgal to go to meet the king to conduct the king over jordan 1916 and shimei the son of gera a benjamite which was of bahurim hasted and came down with the men of judah to meet king david 1917 and there were a thousand men of benjamin with him and ziba the servant of the house of saul and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him and they went over jordan before the king 1918 and there went over a ferry boat to carry over the kings household and to do what he thought good and shimei the son of gera fell down before the king as he was come over jordan 1919 and said unto the king let not my lord impute iniquity unto me neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of jerusalem that the king should take it to his heart 1920 for thy servant doth know that i have sinned therefore behold i am come the first this day of all the house of joseph to go down to meet my lord the king 1921 but abishai the son of zeruiah answered and said shall not shimei be put to death for this because he cursed the lords anointed 1922 and david said what have i to do with you ye sons of zeruiah that ye should this day be adversaries unto me shall there any man be put to death this day in israel for do not i know that i am this day king over israel 1923 therefore the king said unto shimei thou shalt not die and the king sware unto him 1924 and mephibosheth the son of saul came down to meet the king and had neither dressed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace 1925 and it came to pass when he was come to jerusalem to meet the king that the king said unto him wherefore wentest not thou with me mephibosheth 1926 and he answered my lord o king my servant deceived me for thy servant said i will saddle me an ass that i may ride thereon and go to the king because thy servant is lame 1927 and he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king but my lord the king is as an angel of god do therefore what is good in thine eyes 1928 for all of my fathers house were but dead men before my lord the king yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table what right therefore have i yet to cry any more unto the king 1929 and the king said unto him why speakest thou any more of thy matters i have said thou and ziba divide the land 1930 and mephibosheth said unto the king yea let him take all forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house 1931 and barzillai the gileadite came down from rogelim and went over jordan with the king to conduct him over jordan 1932 now barzillai was a very aged man even fourscore years old and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at mahanaim for he was a very great man 1933 and the king said unto barzillai come thou over with me and i will feed thee with me in jerusalem 1934 and barzillai said unto the king how long have i to live that i should go up with the king unto jerusalem 1935 i am this day fourscore years old and can i discern between good and evil can thy servant taste what i eat or what i drink can i hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king 1936 thy servant will go a little way over jordan with the king and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward 1937 let thy servant i pray thee turn back again that i may die in mine own city and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother but behold thy servant chimham let him go over with my lord the king and do to him what shall seem good unto thee 1938 and the king answered chimham shall go over with me and i will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee and whatsoever thou shalt require of me that will i do for thee 1939 and all the people went over jordan and when the king was come over the king kissed barzillai and blessed him and he returned unto his own place 1940 then the king went on to gilgal and chimham went on with him and all the people of judah conducted the king and also half the people of israel 1941 and behold all the men of israel came to the king and said unto the king why have our brethren the men of judah stolen thee away and have brought the king and his household and all davids men with him over jordan 1942 and all the men of judah answered the men of israel because the king is near of kin to us wherefore then be ye angry for this matter have we eaten at all of the kings cost or hath he given us any gift 1943 and the men of israel answered the men of judah and said we have ten parts in the king and we have also more right in david than ye why then did ye despise us that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king and the words of the men of judah were fiercer than the words of the men of israel 201 and there happened to be there a man of belial whose name was sheba the son of bichri a benjamite and he blew a trumpet and said we have no part in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse every man to his tents o israel 202 so every man of israel went up from after david and followed sheba the son of bichri but the men of judah clave unto their king from jordan even to jerusalem 203 and david came to his house at jerusalem and the king took the ten women his concubines whom he had left to keep the house and put them in ward and fed them but went not in unto them so they were shut up unto the day of their death living in widowhood 204 then said the king to amasa assemble me the men of judah within three days and be thou here present 205 so amasa went to assemble the men of judah but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him 206 and david said to abishai now shall sheba the son of bichri do us more harm than did absalom take thou thy lords servants and pursue after him lest he get him fenced cities and escape us 207 and there went out after him joabs men and the cherethites and the pelethites and all the mighty men and they went out of jerusalem to pursue after sheba the son of bichri 208 when they were at the great stone which is in gibeon amasa went before them and joabs garment that he had put on was girded unto him and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in the sheath thereof and as he went forth it fell out 209 and joab said to amasa art thou in health my brother and joab took amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him 2010 but amasa took no heed to the sword that was in joabs hand so he smote him therewith in the fifth rib and shed out his bowels to the ground and struck him not again and he died so joab and abishai his brother pursued after sheba the son of bichri 2011 and one of joabs men stood by him and said he that favoureth joab and he that is for david let him go after joab 2012 and amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway and when the man saw that all the people stood still he removed amasa out of the highway into the field and cast a cloth upon him when he saw that every one that came by him stood still 2013 when he was removed out of the highway all the people went on after joab to pursue after sheba the son of bichri 2014 and he went through all the tribes of israel unto abel and to bethmaachah and all the berites and they were gathered together and went also after him 2015 and they came and besieged him in abel of bethmaachah and they cast up a bank against the city and it stood in the trench and all the people that were with joab battered the wall to throw it down 2016 then cried a wise woman out of the city hear hear say i pray you unto joab come near hither that i may speak with thee 2017 and when he was come near unto her the woman said art thou joab and he answered i am he then she said unto him hear the words of thine handmaid and he answered i do hear 2018 then she spake saying they were wont to speak in old time saying they shall surely ask counsel at abel and so they ended the matter 2019 i am one of them that are peaceable and faithful in israel thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother in israel why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the lord 2020 and joab answered and said far be it far be it from me that i should swallow up or destroy 2021 the matter is not so but a man of mount ephraim sheba the son of bichri by name hath lifted up his hand against the king even against david deliver him only and i will depart from the city and the woman said unto joab behold his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall 2022 then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom and they cut off the head of sheba the son of bichri and cast it out to joab and he blew a trumpet and they retired from the city every man to his tent and joab returned to jerusalem unto the king 2023 now joab was over all the host of israel and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and over the pelethites 2024 and adoram was over the tribute and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud was recorder 2025 and sheva was scribe and zadok and abiathar were the priests 2026 and ira also the jairite was a chief ruler about david 211 then there was a famine in the days of david three years year after year and david enquired of the lord and the lord answered it is for saul and for his bloody house because he slew the gibeonites 212 and the king called the gibeonites and said unto them now the gibeonites were not of the children of israel but of the remnant of the amorites and the children of israel had sworn unto them and saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of israel and judah 213 wherefore david said unto the gibeonites what shall i do for you and wherewith shall i make the atonement that ye may bless the inheritance of the lord 214 and the gibeonites said unto him we will have no silver nor gold of saul nor of his house neither for us shalt thou kill any man in israel and he said what ye shall say that will i do for you 215 and they answered the king the man that consumed us and that devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of the coasts of israel 216 let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us and we will hang them up unto the lord in gibeah of saul whom the lord did choose and the king said i will give them 217 but the king spared mephibosheth the son of jonathan the son of saul because of the lords oath that was between them between david and jonathan the son of saul 218 but the king took the two sons of rizpah the daughter of aiah whom she bare unto saul armoni and mephibosheth and the five sons of michal the daughter of saul whom she brought up for adriel the son of barzillai the meholathite 219 and he delivered them into the hands of the gibeonites and they hanged them in the hill before the lord and they fell all seven together and were put to death in the days of harvest in the first days in the beginning of barley harvest 2110 and rizpah the daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until water dropped upon them out of heaven and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night 2111 and it was told david what rizpah the daughter of aiah the concubine of saul had done 2112 and david went and took the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son from the men of jabeshgilead which had stolen them from the street of bethshan where the philistines had hanged them when the philistines had slain saul in gilboa 2113 and he brought up from thence the bones of saul and the bones of jonathan his son and they gathered the bones of them that were hanged 2114 and the bones of saul and jonathan his son buried they in the country of benjamin in zelah in the sepulchre of kish his father and they performed all that the king commanded and after that god was intreated for the land 2115 moreover the philistines had yet war again with israel and david went down and his servants with him and fought against the philistines and david waxed faint 2116 and ishbibenob which was of the sons of the giant the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight he being girded with a new sword thought to have slain david 2117 but abishai the son of zeruiah succoured him and smote the philistine and killed him then the men of david sware unto him saying thou shalt go no more out with us to battle that thou quench not the light of israel 2118 and it came to pass after this that there was again a battle with the philistines at gob then sibbechai the hushathite slew saph which was of the sons of the giant 2119 and there was again a battle in gob with the philistines where elhanan the son of jaareoregim a bethlehemite slew the brother of goliath the gittite the staff of whose spear was like a weavers beam 2120 and there was yet a battle in gath where was a man of great stature that had on every hand six fingers and on every foot six toes four and twenty in number and he also was born to the giant 2121 and when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimeah the brother of david slew him 2122 these four were born to the giant in gath and fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants 221 and david spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day that the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out of the hand of saul 222 and he said the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer 223 the god of my rock in him will i trust he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge my saviour thou savest me from violence 224 i will call on the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies 225 when the waves of death compassed me the floods of ungodly men made me afraid 226 the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me 227 in my distress i called upon the lord and cried to my god and he did hear my voice out of his temple and my cry did enter into his ears 228 then the earth shook and trembled the foundations of heaven moved and shook because he was wroth 229 there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it 2210 he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet 2211 and he rode upon a cherub and did fly and he was seen upon the wings of the wind 2212 and he made darkness pavilions round about him dark waters and thick clouds of the skies 2213 through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled 2214 the lord thundered from heaven and the most high uttered his voice 2215 and he sent out arrows and scattered them lightning and discomfited them 2216 and the channels of the sea appeared the foundations of the world were discovered at the rebuking of the lord at the blast of the breath of his nostrils 2217 he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters 2218 he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them that hated me for they were too strong for me 2219 they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my stay 2220 he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me 2221 the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me 2222 for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god 2223 for all his judgments were before me and as for his statutes i did not depart from them 2224 i was also upright before him and have kept myself from mine iniquity 2225 therefore the lord hath recompensed me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness in his eye sight 2226 with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful and with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright 2227 with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury 2228 and the afflicted people thou wilt save but thine eyes are upon the haughty that thou mayest bring them down 2229 for thou art my lamp o lord and the lord will lighten my darkness 2230 for by thee i have run through a troop by my god have i leaped over a wall 2231 as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all them that trust in him 2232 for who is god save the lord and who is a rock save our god 2233 god is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect 2234 he maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high places 2235 he teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms 2236 thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy gentleness hath made me great 2237 thou hast enlarged my steps under me so that my feet did not slip 2238 i have pursued mine enemies and destroyed them and turned not again until i had consumed them 2239 and i have consumed them and wounded them that they could not arise yea they are fallen under my feet 2240 for thou hast girded me with strength to battle them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me 2241 thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that i might destroy them that hate me 2242 they looked but there was none to save even unto the lord but he answered them not 2243 then did i beat them as small as the dust of the earth i did stamp them as the mire of the street and did spread them abroad 2244 thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen a people which i knew not shall serve me 2245 strangers shall submit themselves unto me as soon as they hear they shall be obedient unto me 2246 strangers shall fade away and they shall be afraid out of their close places 2247 the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and exalted be the god of the rock of my salvation 2248 it is god that avengeth me and that bringeth down the people under me 2249 and that bringeth me forth from mine enemies thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me thou hast delivered me from the violent man 2250 therefore i will give thanks unto thee o lord among the heathen and i will sing praises unto thy name 2251 he is the tower of salvation for his king and sheweth mercy to his anointed unto david and to his seed for evermore 231 now these be the last words of david david the son of jesse said and the man who was raised up on high the anointed of the god of jacob and the sweet psalmist of israel said 232 the spirit of the lord spake by me and his word was in my tongue 233 the god of israel said the rock of israel spake to me he that ruleth over men must be just ruling in the fear of god 234 and he shall be as the light of the morning when the sun riseth even a morning without clouds as the tender grass springing out of the earth by clear shining after rain 235 although my house be not so with god yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant ordered in all things and sure for this is all my salvation and all my desire although he make it not to grow 236 but the sons of belial shall be all of them as thorns thrust away because they cannot be taken with hands 237 but the man that shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the same place 238 these be the names of the mighty men whom david had the tachmonite that sat in the seat chief among the captains the same was adino the eznite he lift up his spear against eight hundred whom he slew at one time 239 and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite one of the three mighty men with david when they defied the philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the men of israel were gone away 2310 he arose and smote the philistines until his hand was weary and his hand clave unto the sword and the lord wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil 2311 and after him was shammah the son of agee the hararite and the philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a piece of ground full of lentiles and the people fled from the philistines 2312 but he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the philistines and the lord wrought a great victory 2313 and three of the thirty chief went down and came to david in the harvest time unto the cave of adullam and the troop of the philistines pitched in the valley of rephaim 2314 and david was then in an hold and the garrison of the philistines was then in bethlehem 2315 and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem which is by the gate 2316 and the three mighty men brake through the host of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the lord 2317 and he said be it far from me o lord that i should do this is not this the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mighty men 2318 and abishai the brother of joab the son of zeruiah was chief among three and he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them and had the name among three 2319 was he not most honourable of three therefore he was their captain howbeit he attained not unto the first three 2320 and benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of kabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of moab he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow 2321 and he slew an egyptian a goodly man and the egyptian had a spear in his hand but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the egyptians hand and slew him with his own spear 2322 these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had the name among three mighty men 2323 he was more honourable than the thirty but he attained not to the first three and david set him over his guard 2324 asahel the brother of joab was one of the thirty elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem 2325 shammah the harodite elika the harodite 2326 helez the paltite ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite 2327 abiezer the anethothite mebunnai the hushathite 2328 zalmon the ahohite maharai the netophathite 2329 heleb the son of baanah a netophathite ittai the son of ribai out of gibeah of the children of benjamin 2330 benaiah the pirathonite hiddai of the brooks of gaash 2331 abialbon the arbathite azmaveth the barhumite 2332 eliahba the shaalbonite of the sons of jashen jonathan 2333 shammah the hararite ahiam the son of sharar the hararite 2334 eliphelet the son of ahasbai the son of the maachathite eliam the son of ahithophel the gilonite 2335 hezrai the carmelite paarai the arbite 2336 igal the son of nathan of zobah bani the gadite 2337 zelek the ammonite nahari the beerothite armourbearer to joab the son of zeruiah 2338 ira an ithrite gareb an ithrite 2339 uriah the hittite thirty and seven in all 241 and again the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he moved david against them to say go number israel and judah 242 for the king said to joab the captain of the host which was with him go now through all the tribes of israel from dan even to beersheba and number ye the people that i may know the number of the people 243 and joab said unto the king now the lord thy god add unto the people how many soever they be an hundredfold and that the eyes of my lord the king may see it but why doth my lord the king delight in this thing 244 notwithstanding the kings word prevailed against joab and against the captains of the host and joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king to number the people of israel 245 and they passed over jordan and pitched in aroer on the right side of the city that lieth in the midst of the river of gad and toward jazer 246 then they came to gilead and to the land of tahtimhodshi and they came to danjaan and about to zidon 247 and came to the strong hold of tyre and to all the cities of the hivites and of the canaanites and they went out to the south of judah even to beersheba 248 so when they had gone through all the land they came to jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days 249 and joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king and there were in israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword and the men of judah were five hundred thousand men 2410 and davids heart smote him after that he had numbered the people and david said unto the lord i have sinned greatly in that i have done and now i beseech thee o lord take away the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly 2411 for when david was up in the morning the word of the lord came unto the prophet gad davids seer saying 2412 go and say unto david thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee 2413 so gad came to david and told him and said unto him shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land or wilt thou flee three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee or that there be three days pestilence in thy land now advise and see what answer i shall return to him that sent me 2414 and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let us fall now into the hand of the lord for his mercies are great and let me not fall into the hand of man 2415 so the lord sent a pestilence upon israel from the morning even to the time appointed and there died of the people from dan even to beersheba seventy thousand men 2416 and when the angel stretched out his hand upon jerusalem to destroy it the lord repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed the people it is enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the lord was by the threshingplace of araunah the jebusite 2417 and david spake unto the lord when he saw the angel that smote the people and said lo i have sinned and i have done wickedly but these sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray thee be against me and against my fathers house 2418 and gad came that day to david and said unto him go up rear an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of araunah the jebusite 2419 and david according to the saying of gad went up as the lord commanded 2420 and araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming on toward him and araunah went out and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground 2421 and araunah said wherefore is my lord the king come to his servant and david said to buy the threshingfloor of thee to build an altar unto the lord that the plague may be stayed from the people 2422 and araunah said unto david let my lord the king take and offer up what seemeth good unto him behold here be oxen for burnt sacrifice and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood 2423 all these things did araunah as a king give unto the king and araunah said unto the king the lord thy god accept thee 2424 and the king said unto araunah nay but i will surely buy it of thee at a price neither will i offer burnt offerings unto the lord my god of that which doth cost me nothing so david bought the threshingfloor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver 2425 and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings so the lord was intreated for the land and the plague was stayed from israel the first book of the kings commonly called the third book of the kings 11 now king david was old and stricken in years and they covered him with clothes but he gat no heat 12 wherefore his servants said unto him let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin and let her stand before the king and let her cherish him and let her lie in thy bosom that my lord the king may get heat 13 so they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts of israel and found abishag a shunammite and brought her to the king 14 and the damsel was very fair and cherished the king and ministered to him but the king knew her not 15 then adonijah the son of haggith exalted himself saying i will be king and he prepared him chariots and horsemen and fifty men to run before him 16 and his father had not displeased him at any time in saying why hast thou done so and he also was a very goodly man and his mother bare him after absalom 17 and he conferred with joab the son of zeruiah and with abiathar the priest and they following adonijah helped him 18 but zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and nathan the prophet and shimei and rei and the mighty men which belonged to david were not with adonijah 19 and adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of zoheleth which is by enrogel and called all his brethren the kings sons and all the men of judah the kings servants 110 but nathan the prophet and benaiah and the mighty men and solomon his brother he called not 111 wherefore nathan spake unto bathsheba the mother of solomon saying hast thou not heard that adonijah the son of haggith doth reign and david our lord knoweth it not 112 now therefore come let me i pray thee give thee counsel that thou mayest save thine own life and the life of thy son solomon 113 go and get thee in unto king david and say unto him didst not thou my lord o king swear unto thine handmaid saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne why then doth adonijah reign 114 behold while thou yet talkest there with the king i also will come in after thee and confirm thy words 115 and bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber and the king was very old and abishag the shunammite ministered unto the king 116 and bathsheba bowed and did obeisance unto the king and the king said what wouldest thou 117 and she said unto him my lord thou swarest by the lord thy god unto thine handmaid saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne 118 and now behold adonijah reigneth and now my lord the king thou knowest it not 119 and he hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the sons of the king and abiathar the priest and joab the captain of the host but solomon thy servant hath he not called 120 and thou my lord o king the eyes of all israel are upon thee that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him 121 otherwise it shall come to pass when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers that i and my son solomon shall be counted offenders 122 and lo while she yet talked with the king nathan the prophet also came in 123 and they told the king saying behold nathan the prophet and when he was come in before the king he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground 124 and nathan said my lord o king hast thou said adonijah shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne 125 for he is gone down this day and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and hath called all the kings sons and the captains of the host and abiathar the priest and behold they eat and drink before him and say god save king adonijah 126 but me even me thy servant and zadok the priest and benaiah the son of jehoiada and thy servant solomon hath he not called 127 is this thing done by my lord the king and thou hast not shewed it unto thy servant who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him 128 then king david answered and said call me bathsheba and she came into the kings presence and stood before the king 129 and the king sware and said as the lord liveth that hath redeemed my soul out of all distress 130 even as i sware unto thee by the lord god of israel saying assuredly solomon thy son shall reign after me and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead even so will i certainly do this day 131 then bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and did reverence to the king and said let my lord king david live for ever 132 and king david said call me zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and they came before the king 133 the king also said unto them take with you the servants of your lord and cause solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule and bring him down to gihon 134 and let zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him there king over israel and blow ye with the trumpet and say god save king solomon 135 then ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my throne for he shall be king in my stead and i have appointed him to be ruler over israel and over judah 136 and benaiah the son of jehoiada answered the king and said amen the lord god of my lord the king say so too 137 as the lord hath been with my lord the king even so be he with solomon and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king david 138 so zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites went down and caused solomon to ride upon king davids mule and brought him to gihon 139 and zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle and anointed solomon and they blew the trumpet and all the people said god save king solomon 140 and all the people came up after him and the people piped with pipes and rejoiced with great joy so that the earth rent with the sound of them 141 and adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating and when joab heard the sound of the trumpet he said wherefore is this noise of the city being in an uproar 142 and while he yet spake behold jonathan the son of abiathar the priest came and adonijah said unto him come in for thou art a valiant man and bringest good tidings 143 and jonathan answered and said to adonijah verily our lord king david hath made solomon king 144 and the king hath sent with him zadok the priest and nathan the prophet and benaiah the son of jehoiada and the cherethites and the pelethites and they have caused him to ride upon the kings mule 145 and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him king in gihon and they are come up from thence rejoicing so that the city rang again this is the noise that ye have heard 146 and also solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom 147 and moreover the kings servants came to bless our lord king david saying god make the name of solomon better than thy name and make his throne greater than thy throne and the king bowed himself upon the bed 148 and also thus said the king blessed be the lord god of israel which hath given one to sit on my throne this day mine eyes even seeing it 149 and all the guests that were with adonijah were afraid and rose up and went every man his way 150 and adonijah feared because of solomon and arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar 151 and it was told solomon saying behold adonijah feareth king solomon for lo he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar saying let king solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his servant with the sword 152 and solomon said if he will shew himself a worthy man there shall not an hair of him fall to the earth but if wickedness shall be found in him he shall die 153 so king solomon sent and they brought him down from the altar and he came and bowed himself to king solomon and solomon said unto him go to thine house 21 now the days of david drew nigh that he should die and he charged solomon his son saying 22 i go the way of all the earth be thou strong therefore and shew thyself a man 23 and keep the charge of the lord thy god to walk in his ways to keep his statutes and his commandments and his judgments and his testimonies as it is written in the law of moses that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest and whithersoever thou turnest thyself 24 that the lord may continue his word which he spake concerning me saying if thy children take heed to their way to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul there shall not fail thee said he a man on the throne of israel 25 moreover thou knowest also what joab the son of zeruiah did to me and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of israel unto abner the son of ner and unto amasa the son of jether whom he slew and shed the blood of war in peace and put the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his feet 26 do therefore according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace 27 but shew kindness unto the sons of barzillai the gileadite and let them be of those that eat at thy table for so they came to me when i fled because of absalom thy brother 28 and behold thou hast with thee shimei the son of gera a benjamite of bahurim which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when i went to mahanaim but he came down to meet me at jordan and i sware to him by the lord saying i will not put thee to death with the sword 29 now therefore hold him not guiltless for thou art a wise man and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him but his hoar head bring thou down to the grave with blood 210 so david slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david 211 and the days that david reigned over israel were forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem 212 then sat solomon upon the throne of david his father and his kingdom was established greatly 213 and adonijah the son of haggith came to bathsheba the mother of solomon and she said comest thou peaceably and he said peaceably 214 he said moreover i have somewhat to say unto thee and she said say on 215 and he said thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that all israel set their faces on me that i should reign howbeit the kingdom is turned about and is become my brothers for it was his from the lord 216 and now i ask one petition of thee deny me not and she said unto him say on 217 and he said speak i pray thee unto solomon the king for he will not say thee nay that he give me abishag the shunammite to wife 218 and bathsheba said well i will speak for thee unto the king 219 bathsheba therefore went unto king solomon to speak unto him for adonijah and the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto her and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for the kings mother and she sat on his right hand 220 then she said i desire one small petition of thee i pray thee say me not nay and the king said unto her ask on my mother for i will not say thee nay 221 and she said let abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah thy brother to wife 222 and king solomon answered and said unto his mother and why dost thou ask abishag the shunammite for adonijah ask for him the kingdom also for he is mine elder brother even for him and for abiathar the priest and for joab the son of zeruiah 223 then king solomon sware by the lord saying god do so to me and more also if adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life 224 now therefore as the lord liveth which hath established me and set me on the throne of david my father and who hath made me an house as he promised adonijah shall be put to death this day 225 and king solomon sent by the hand of benaiah the son of jehoiada and he fell upon him that he died 226 and unto abiathar the priest said the king get thee to anathoth unto thine own fields for thou art worthy of death but i will not at this time put thee to death because thou barest the ark of the lord god before david my father and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted 227 so solomon thrust out abiathar from being priest unto the lord that he might fulfil the word of the lord which he spake concerning the house of eli in shiloh 228 then tidings came to joab for joab had turned after adonijah though he turned not after absalom and joab fled unto the tabernacle of the lord and caught hold on the horns of the altar 229 and it was told king solomon that joab was fled unto the tabernacle of the lord and behold he is by the altar then solomon sent benaiah the son of jehoiada saying go fall upon him 230 and benaiah came to the tabernacle of the lord and said unto him thus saith the king come forth and he said nay but i will die here and benaiah brought the king word again saying thus said joab and thus he answered me 231 and the king said unto him do as he hath said and fall upon him and bury him that thou mayest take away the innocent blood which joab shed from me and from the house of my father 232 and the lord shall return his blood upon his own head who fell upon two men more righteous and better than he and slew them with the sword my father david not knowing thereof to wit abner the son of ner captain of the host of israel and amasa the son of jether captain of the host of judah 233 their blood shall therefore return upon the head of joab and upon the head of his seed for ever but upon david and upon his seed and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace for ever from the lord 234 so benaiah the son of jehoiada went up and fell upon him and slew him and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness 235 and the king put benaiah the son of jehoiada in his room over the host and zadok the priest did the king put in the room of abiathar 236 and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him build thee an house in jerusalem and dwell there and go not forth thence any whither 237 for it shall be that on the day thou goest out and passest over the brook kidron thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die thy blood shall be upon thine own head 238 and shimei said unto the king the saying is good as my lord the king hath said so will thy servant do and shimei dwelt in jerusalem many days 239 and it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the servants of shimei ran away unto achish son of maachah king of gath and they told shimei saying behold thy servants be in gath 240 and shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to gath to achish to seek his servants and shimei went and brought his servants from gath 241 and it was told solomon that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath and was come again 242 and the king sent and called for shimei and said unto him did i not make thee to swear by the lord and protested unto thee saying know for a certain on the day thou goest out and walkest abroad any whither that thou shalt surely die and thou saidst unto me the word that i have heard is good 243 why then hast thou not kept the oath of the lord and the commandment that i have charged thee with 244 the king said moreover to shimei thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heart is privy to that thou didst to david my father therefore the lord shall return thy wickedness upon thine own head 245 and king solomon shall be blessed and the throne of david shall be established before the lord for ever 246 so the king commanded benaiah the son of jehoiada which went out and fell upon him that he died and the kingdom was established in the hand of solomon 31 and solomon made affinity with pharaoh king of egypt and took pharaohs daughter and brought her into the city of david until he had made an end of building his own house and the house of the lord and the wall of jerusalem round about 32 only the people sacrificed in high places because there was no house built unto the name of the lord until those days 33 and solomon loved the lord walking in the statutes of david his father only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places 34 and the king went to gibeon to sacrifice there for that was the great high place a thousand burnt offerings did solomon offer upon that altar 35 in gibeon the lord appeared to solomon in a dream by night and god said ask what i shall give thee 36 and solomon said thou hast shewed unto thy servant david my father great mercy according as he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee and thou hast kept for him this great kindness that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne as it is this day 37 and now o lord my god thou hast made thy servant king instead of david my father and i am but a little child i know not how to go out or come in 38 and thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen a great people that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude 39 give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people that i may discern between good and bad for who is able to judge this thy so great a people 310 and the speech pleased the lord that solomon had asked this thing 311 and god said unto him because thou hast asked this thing and hast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches for thyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment 312 behold i have done according to thy words lo i have given thee a wise and an understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee 313 and i have also given thee that which thou hast not asked both riches and honour so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days 314 and if thou wilt walk in my ways to keep my statutes and my commandments as thy father david did walk then i will lengthen thy days 315 and solomon awoke and behold it was a dream and he came to jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the lord and offered up burnt offerings and offered peace offerings and made a feast to all his servants 316 then came there two women that were harlots unto the king and stood before him 317 and the one woman said o my lord i and this woman dwell in one house and i was delivered of a child with her in the house 318 and it came to pass the third day after that i was delivered that this woman was delivered also and we were together there was no stranger with us in the house save we two in the house 319 and this womans child died in the night because she overlaid it 320 and she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thine handmaid slept and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom 321 and when i rose in the morning to give my child suck behold it was dead but when i had considered it in the morning behold it was not my son which i did bear 322 and the other woman said nay but the living is my son and the dead is thy son and this said no but the dead is thy son and the living is my son thus they spake before the king 323 then said the king the one saith this is my son that liveth and thy son is the dead and the other saith nay but thy son is the dead and my son is the living 324 and the king said bring me a sword and they brought a sword before the king 325 and the king said divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other 326 then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king for her bowels yearned upon her son and she said o my lord give her the living child and in no wise slay it but the other said let it be neither mine nor thine but divide it 327 then the king answered and said give her the living child and in no wise slay it she is the mother thereof 328 and all israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged and they feared the king for they saw that the wisdom of god was in him to do judgment 41 so king solomon was king over all israel 42 and these were the princes which he had azariah the son of zadok the priest 43 elihoreph and ahiah the sons of shisha scribes jehoshaphat the son of ahilud the recorder 44 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the host and zadok and abiathar were the priests 45 and azariah the son of nathan was over the officers and zabud the son of nathan was principal officer and the kings friend 46 and ahishar was over the household and adoniram the son of abda was over the tribute 47 and solomon had twelve officers over all israel which provided victuals for the king and his household each man his month in a year made provision 48 and these are their names the son of hur in mount ephraim 49 the son of dekar in makaz and in shaalbim and bethshemesh and elonbethhanan 410 the son of hesed in aruboth to him pertained sochoh and all the land of hepher 411 the son of abinadab in all the region of dor which had taphath the daughter of solomon to wife 412 baana the son of ahilud to him pertained taanach and megiddo and all bethshean which is by zartanah beneath jezreel from bethshean to abelmeholah even unto the place that is beyond jokneam 413 the son of geber in ramothgilead to him pertained the towns of jair the son of manasseh which are in gilead to him also pertained the region of argob which is in bashan threescore great cities with walls and brasen bars 414 ahinadab the son of iddo had mahanaim 415 ahimaaz was in naphtali he also took basmath the daughter of solomon to wife 416 baanah the son of hushai was in asher and in aloth 417 jehoshaphat the son of paruah in issachar 418 shimei the son of elah in benjamin 419 geber the son of uri was in the country of gilead in the country of sihon king of the amorites and of og king of bashan and he was the only officer which was in the land 420 judah and israel were many as the sand which is by the sea in multitude eating and drinking and making merry 421 and solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the philistines and unto the border of egypt they brought presents and served solomon all the days of his life 422 and solomons provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour and threescore measures of meal 423 ten fat oxen and twenty oxen out of the pastures and an hundred sheep beside harts and roebucks and fallowdeer and fatted fowl 424 for he had dominion over all the region on this side the river from tiphsah even to azzah over all the kings on this side the river and he had peace on all sides round about him 425 and judah and israel dwelt safely every man under his vine and under his fig tree from dan even to beersheba all the days of solomon 426 and solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots and twelve thousand horsemen 427 and those officers provided victual for king solomon and for all that came unto king solomons table every man in his month they lacked nothing 428 barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought they unto the place where the officers were every man according to his charge 429 and god gave solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much and largeness of heart even as the sand that is on the sea shore 430 and solomons wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east country and all the wisdom of egypt 431 for he was wiser than all men than ethan the ezrahite and heman and chalcol and darda the sons of mahol and his fame was in all nations round about 432 and he spake three thousand proverbs and his songs were a thousand and five 433 and he spake of trees from the cedar tree that is in lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall he spake also of beasts and of fowl and of creeping things and of fishes 434 and there came of all people to hear the wisdom of solomon from all kings of the earth which had heard of his wisdom 51 and hiram king of tyre sent his servants unto solomon for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father for hiram was ever a lover of david 52 and solomon sent to hiram saying 53 thou knowest how that david my father could not build an house unto the name of the lord his god for the wars which were about him on every side until the lord put them under the soles of his feet 54 but now the lord my god hath given me rest on every side so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent 55 and behold i purpose to build an house unto the name of the lord my god as the lord spake unto david my father saying thy son whom i will set upon thy throne in thy room he shall build an house unto my name 56 now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of lebanon and my servants shall be with thy servants and unto thee will i give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like unto the sidonians 57 and it came to pass when hiram heard the words of solomon that he rejoiced greatly and said blessed be the lord this day which hath given unto david a wise son over this great people 58 and hiram sent to solomon saying i have considered the things which thou sentest to me for and i will do all thy desire concerning timber of cedar and concerning timber of fir 59 my servants shall bring them down from lebanon unto the sea and i will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt appoint me and will cause them to be discharged there and thou shalt receive them and thou shalt accomplish my desire in giving food for my household 510 so hiram gave solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire 511 and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household and twenty measures of pure oil thus gave solomon to hiram year by year 512 and the lord gave solomon wisdom as he promised him and there was peace between hiram and solomon and they two made a league together 513 and king solomon raised a levy out of all israel and the levy was thirty thousand men 514 and he sent them to lebanon ten thousand a month by courses a month they were in lebanon and two months at home and adoniram was over the levy 515 and solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains 516 beside the chief of solomons officers which were over the work three thousand and three hundred which ruled over the people that wrought in the work 517 and the king commanded and they brought great stones costly stones and hewed stones to lay the foundation of the house 518 and solomons builders and hirams builders did hew them and the stonesquarers so they prepared timber and stones to build the house 61 and it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of israel were come out of the land of egypt in the fourth year of solomons reign over israel in the month zif which is the second month that he began to build the house of the lord 62 and the house which king solomon built for the lord the length thereof was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubits 63 and the porch before the temple of the house twenty cubits was the length thereof according to the breadth of the house and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house 64 and for the house he made windows of narrow lights 65 and against the wall of the house he built chambers round about against the walls of the house round about both of the temple and of the oracle and he made chambers round about 66 the nethermost chamber was five cubits broad and the middle was six cubits broad and the third was seven cubits broad for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house 67 and the house when it was in building was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither so that there was neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house while it was in building 68 the door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber and out of the middle into the third 69 so he built the house and finished it and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar 610 and then he built chambers against all the house five cubits high and they rested on the house with timber of cedar 611 and the word of the lord came to solomon saying 612 concerning this house which thou art in building if thou wilt walk in my statutes and execute my judgments and keep all my commandments to walk in them then will i perform my word with thee which i spake unto david thy father 613 and i will dwell among the children of israel and will not forsake my people israel 614 so solomon built the house and finished it 615 and he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar both the floor of the house and the walls of the ceiling and he covered them on the inside with wood and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir 616 and he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar he even built them for it within even for the oracle even for the most holy place 617 and the house that is the temple before it was forty cubits long 618 and the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers all was cedar there was no stone seen 619 and the oracle he prepared in the house within to set there the ark of the covenant of the lord 620 and the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits in breadth and twenty cubits in the height thereof and he overlaid it with pure gold and so covered the altar which was of cedar 621 so solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle and he overlaid it with gold 622 and the whole house he overlaid with gold until he had finished all the house also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold 623 and within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree each ten cubits high 624 and five cubits was the one wing of the cherub and five cubits the other wing of the cherub from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits 625 and the other cherub was ten cubits both the cherubims were of one measure and one size 626 the height of the one cherub was ten cubits and so was it of the other cherub 627 and he set the cherubims within the inner house and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims so that the wing of the one touched the one wall and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house 628 and he overlaid the cherubims with gold 629 and he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers within and without 630 and the floors of the house he overlaid with gold within and without 631 and for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall 632 the two doors also were of olive tree and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and overlaid them with gold and spread gold upon the cherubims and upon the palm trees 633 so also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree a fourth part of the wall 634 and the two doors were of fir tree the two leaves of the one door were folding and the two leaves of the other door were folding 635 and he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work 636 and he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone and a row of cedar beams 637 in the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the lord laid in the month zif 638 and in the eleventh year in the month bul which is the eighth month was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof and according to all the fashion of it so was he seven years in building it 71 but solomon was building his own house thirteen years and he finished all his house 72 he built also the house of the forest of lebanon the length thereof was an hundred cubits and the breadth thereof fifty cubits and the height thereof thirty cubits upon four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams upon the pillars 73 and it was covered with cedar above upon the beams that lay on forty five pillars fifteen in a row 74 and there were windows in three rows and light was against light in three ranks 75 and all the doors and posts were square with the windows and light was against light in three ranks 76 and he made a porch of pillars the length thereof was fifty cubits and the breadth thereof thirty cubits and the porch was before them and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them 77 then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge even the porch of judgment and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other 78 and his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch which was of the like work solomon made also an house for pharaohs daughter whom he had taken to wife like unto this porch 79 all these were of costly stones according to the measures of hewed stones sawed with saws within and without even from the foundation unto the coping and so on the outside toward the great court 710 and the foundation was of costly stones even great stones stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits 711 and above were costly stones after the measures of hewed stones and cedars 712 and the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones and a row of cedar beams both for the inner court of the house of the lord and for the porch of the house 713 and king solomon sent and fetched hiram out of tyre 714 he was a widows son of the tribe of naphtali and his father was a man of tyre a worker in brass and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and cunning to work all works in brass and he came to king solomon and wrought all his work 715 for he cast two pillars of brass of eighteen cubits high apiece and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about 716 and he made two chapiters of molten brass to set upon the tops of the pillars the height of the one chapiter was five cubits and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits 717 and nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars seven for the one chapiter and seven for the other chapiter 718 and he made the pillars and two rows round about upon the one network to cover the chapiters that were upon the top with pomegranates and so did he for the other chapiter 719 and the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch four cubits 720 and the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates also above over against the belly which was by the network and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the other chapiter 721 and he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple and he set up the right pillar and called the name thereof jachin and he set up the left pillar and called the name thereof boaz 722 and upon the top of the pillars was lily work so was the work of the pillars finished 723 and he made a molten sea ten cubits from the one brim to the other it was round all about and his height was five cubits and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about 724 and under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about the knops were cast in two rows when it was cast 725 it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them and all their hinder parts were inward 726 and it was an hand breadth thick and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies it contained two thousand baths 727 and he made ten bases of brass four cubits was the length of one base and four cubits the breadth thereof and three cubits the height of it 728 and the work of the bases was on this manner they had borders and the borders were between the ledges 729 and on the borders that were between the ledges were lions oxen and cherubims and upon the ledges there was a base above and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work 730 and every base had four brasen wheels and plates of brass and the four corners thereof had undersetters under the laver were undersetters molten at the side of every addition 731 and the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base a cubit and an half and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with their borders foursquare not round 732 and under the borders were four wheels and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit 733 and the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel their axletrees and their naves and their felloes and their spokes were all molten 734 and there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base and the undersetters were of the very base itself 735 and in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same 736 for on the plates of the ledges thereof and on the borders thereof he graved cherubims lions and palm trees according to the proportion of every one and additions round about 737 after this manner he made the ten bases all of them had one casting one measure and one size 738 then made he ten lavers of brass one laver contained forty baths and every laver was four cubits and upon every one of the ten bases one laver 739 and he put five bases on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south 740 and hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the basons so hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king solomon for the house of the lord 741 the two pillars and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars 742 and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks even two rows of pomegranates for one network to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars 743 and the ten bases and ten lavers on the bases 744 and one sea and twelve oxen under the sea 745 and the pots and the shovels and the basons and all these vessels which hiram made to king solomon for the house of the lord were of bright brass 746 in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between succoth and zarthan 747 and solomon left all the vessels unweighed because they were exceeding many neither was the weight of the brass found out 748 and solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the lord the altar of gold and the table of gold whereupon the shewbread was 749 and the candlesticks of pure gold five on the right side and five on the left before the oracle with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold 750 and the bowls and the snuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of pure gold and the hinges of gold both for the doors of the inner house the most holy place and for the doors of the house to wit of the temple 751 so was ended all the work that king solomon made for the house of the lord and solomon brought in the things which david his father had dedicated even the silver and the gold and the vessels did he put among the treasures of the house of the lord 81 then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of israel unto king solomon in jerusalem that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david which is zion 82 and all the men of israel assembled themselves unto king solomon at the feast in the month ethanim which is the seventh month 83 and all the elders of israel came and the priests took up the ark 84 and they brought up the ark of the lord and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle even those did the priests and the levites bring up 85 and king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him were with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be told nor numbered for multitude 86 and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place into the oracle of the house to the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims 87 for the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above 88 and they drew out the staves that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the oracle and they were not seen without and there they are unto this day 89 there was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone which moses put there at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of the land of egypt 810 and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place that the cloud filled the house of the lord 811 so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of the lord 812 then spake solomon the lord said that he would dwell in the thick darkness 813 i have surely built thee an house to dwell in a settled place for thee to abide in for ever 814 and the king turned his face about and blessed all the congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood 815 and he said blessed be the lord god of israel which spake with his mouth unto david my father and hath with his hand fulfilled it saying 816 since the day that i brought forth my people israel out of egypt i chose no city out of all the tribes of israel to build an house that my name might be therein but i chose david to be over my people israel 817 and it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel 818 and the lord said unto david my father whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name thou didst well that it was in thine heart 819 nevertheless thou shalt not build the house but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house unto my name 820 and the lord hath performed his word that he spake and i am risen up in the room of david my father and sit on the throne of israel as the lord promised and have built an house for the name of the lord god of israel 821 and i have set there a place for the ark wherein is the covenant of the lord which he made with our fathers when he brought them out of the land of egypt 822 and solomon stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven 823 and he said lord god of israel there is no god like thee in heaven above or on earth beneath who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart 824 who hast kept with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him thou spakest also with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this day 825 therefore now lord god of israel keep with thy servant david my father that thou promisedst him saying there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit on the throne of israel so that thy children take heed to their way that they walk before me as thou hast walked before me 826 and now o god of israel let thy word i pray thee be verified which thou spakest unto thy servant david my father 827 but will god indeed dwell on the earth behold the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that i have builded 828 yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee to day 829 that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day even toward the place of which thou hast said my name shall be there that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall make toward this place 830 and hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant and of thy people israel when they shall pray toward this place and hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and when thou hearest forgive 831 if any man trespass against his neighbour and an oath be laid upon him to cause him to swear and the oath come before thine altar in this house 832 then hear thou in heaven and do and judge thy servants condemning the wicked to bring his way upon his head and justifying the righteous to give him according to his righteousness 833 when thy people israel be smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication unto thee in this house 834 then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest unto their fathers 835 when heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou afflictest them 836 then hear thou in heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people israel that thou teach them the good way wherein they should walk and give rain upon thy land which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance 837 if there be in the land famine if there be pestilence blasting mildew locust or if there be caterpiller if their enemy besiege them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague whatsoever sickness there be 838 what prayer and supplication soever be made by any man or by all thy people israel which shall know every man the plague of his own heart and spread forth his hands toward this house 839 then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and do and give to every man according to his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou even thou only knowest the hearts of all the children of men 840 that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers 841 moreover concerning a stranger that is not of thy people israel but cometh out of a far country for thy names sake 842 for they shall hear of thy great name and of thy strong hand and of thy stretched out arm when he shall come and pray toward this house 843 hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth may know thy name to fear thee as do thy people israel and that they may know that this house which i have builded is called by thy name 844 if thy people go out to battle against their enemy whithersoever thou shalt send them and shall pray unto the lord toward the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house that i have built for thy name 845 then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause 846 if they sin against thee for there is no man that sinneth not and thou be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy far or near 847 yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither they were carried captives and repent and make supplication unto thee in the land of them that carried them captives saying we have sinned and have done perversely we have committed wickedness 848 and so return unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies which led them away captive and pray unto thee toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers the city which thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name 849 then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thy dwelling place and maintain their cause 850 and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their transgressions wherein they have transgressed against thee and give them compassion before them who carried them captive that they may have compassion on them 851 for they be thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest forth out of egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron 852 that thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant and unto the supplication of thy people israel to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee 853 for thou didst separate them from among all the people of the earth to be thine inheritance as thou spakest by the hand of moses thy servant when thou broughtest our fathers out of egypt o lord god 854 and it was so that when solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the lord he arose from before the altar of the lord from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread up to heaven 855 and he stood and blessed all the congregation of israel with a loud voice saying 856 blessed be the lord that hath given rest unto his people israel according to all that he promised there hath not failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of moses his servant 857 the lord our god be with us as he was with our fathers let him not leave us nor forsake us 858 that he may incline our hearts unto him to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments which he commanded our fathers 859 and let these my words wherewith i have made supplication before the lord be nigh unto the lord our god day and night that he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people israel at all times as the matter shall require 860 that all the people of the earth may know that the lord is god and that there is none else 861 let your heart therefore be perfect with the lord our god to walk in his statutes and to keep his commandments as at this day 862 and the king and all israel with him offered sacrifice before the lord 863 and solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings which he offered unto the lord two and twenty thousand oxen and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the children of israel dedicated the house of the lord 864 the same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the lord for there he offered burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the brasen altar that was before the lord was too little to receive the burnt offerings and meat offerings and the fat of the peace offerings 865 and at that time solomon held a feast and all israel with him a great congregation from the entering in of hamath unto the river of egypt before the lord our god seven days and seven days even fourteen days 866 on the eighth day he sent the people away and they blessed the king and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the lord had done for david his servant and for israel his people 91 and it came to pass when solomon had finished the building of the house of the lord and the kings house and all solomons desire which he was pleased to do 92 that the lord appeared to solomon the second time as he had appeared unto him at gibeon 93 and the lord said unto him i have heard thy prayer and thy supplication that thou hast made before me i have hallowed this house which thou hast built to put my name there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually 94 and if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked in integrity of heart and in uprightness to do according to all that i have commanded thee and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments 95 then i will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon israel for ever as i promised to david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of israel 96 but if ye shall at all turn from following me ye or your children and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which i have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them 97 then will i cut off israel out of the land which i have given them and this house which i have hallowed for my name will i cast out of my sight and israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all people 98 and at this house which is high every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss and they shall say why hath the lord done thus unto this land and to this house 99 and they shall answer because they forsook the lord their god who brought forth their fathers out of the land of egypt and have taken hold upon other gods and have worshipped them and served them therefore hath the lord brought upon them all this evil 910 and it came to pass at the end of twenty years when solomon had built the two houses the house of the lord and the kings house 911 now hiram the king of tyre had furnished solomon with cedar trees and fir trees and with gold according to all his desire that then king solomon gave hiram twenty cities in the land of galilee 912 and hiram came out from tyre to see the cities which solomon had given him and they pleased him not 913 and he said what cities are these which thou hast given me my brother and he called them the land of cabul unto this day 914 and hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold 915 and this is the reason of the levy which king solomon raised for to build the house of the lord and his own house and millo and the wall of jerusalem and hazor and megiddo and gezer 916 for pharaoh king of egypt had gone up and taken gezer and burnt it with fire and slain the canaanites that dwelt in the city and given it for a present unto his daughter solomons wife 917 and solomon built gezer and bethhoron the nether 918 and baalath and tadmor in the wilderness in the land 919 and all the cities of store that solomon had and cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen and that which solomon desired to build in jerusalem and in lebanon and in all the land of his dominion 920 and all the people that were left of the amorites hittites perizzites hivites and jebusites which were not of the children of israel 921 their children that were left after them in the land whom the children of israel also were not able utterly to destroy upon those did solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day 922 but of the children of israel did solomon make no bondmen but they were men of war and his servants and his princes and his captains and rulers of his chariots and his horsemen 923 these were the chief of the officers that were over solomons work five hundred and fifty which bare rule over the people that wrought in the work 924 but pharaohs daughter came up out of the city of david unto her house which solomon had built for her then did he build millo 925 and three times in a year did solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the lord and he burnt incense upon the altar that was before the lord so he finished the house 926 and king solomon made a navy of ships in eziongeber which is beside eloth on the shore of the red sea in the land of edom 927 and hiram sent in the navy his servants shipmen that had knowledge of the sea with the servants of solomon 928 and they came to ophir and fetched from thence gold four hundred and twenty talents and brought it to king solomon 101 and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon concerning the name of the lord she came to prove him with hard questions 102 and she came to jerusalem with a very great train with camels that bare spices and very much gold and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart 103 and solomon told her all her questions there was not any thing hid from the king which he told her not 104 and when the queen of sheba had seen all solomons wisdom and the house that he had built 105 and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel and his cupbearers and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her 106 and she said to the king it was a true report that i heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom 107 howbeit i believed not the words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the half was not told me thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which i heard 108 happy are thy men happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom 109 blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee on the throne of israel because the lord loved israel for ever therefore made he thee king to do judgment and justice 1010 and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices very great store and precious stones there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of sheba gave to king solomon 1011 and the navy also of hiram that brought gold from ophir brought in from ophir great plenty of almug trees and precious stones 1012 and the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the lord and for the kings house harps also and psalteries for singers there came no such almug trees nor were seen unto this day 1013 and king solomon gave unto the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which solomon gave her of his royal bounty so she turned and went to her own country she and her servants 1014 now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold 1015 beside that he had of the merchantmen and of the traffick of the spice merchants and of all the kings of arabia and of the governors of the country 1016 and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six hundred shekels of gold went to one target 1017 and he made three hundred shields of beaten gold three pound of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon 1018 moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the best gold 1019 the throne had six steps and the top of the throne was round behind and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat and two lions stood beside the stays 1020 and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom 1021 and all king solomons drinking vessels were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was nothing accounted of in the days of solomon 1022 for the king had at sea a navy of tharshish with the navy of hiram once in three years came the navy of tharshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks 1023 so king solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom 1024 and all the earth sought to solomon to hear his wisdom which god had put in his heart 1025 and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and garments and armour and spices horses and mules a rate year by year 1026 and solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots and with the king at jerusalem 1027 and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance 1028 and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the kings merchants received the linen yarn at a price 1029 and a chariot came up and went out of egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so for all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria did they bring them out by their means 111 but king solomon loved many strange women together with the daughter of pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites edomites zidonians and hittites 112 of the nations concerning which the lord said unto the children of israel ye shall not go in to them neither shall they come in unto you for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods solomon clave unto these in love 113 and he had seven hundred wives princesses and three hundred concubines and his wives turned away his heart 114 for it came to pass when solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as was the heart of david his father 115 for solomon went after ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians and after milcom the abomination of the ammonites 116 and solomon did evil in the sight of the lord and went not fully after the lord as did david his father 117 then did solomon build an high place for chemosh the abomination of moab in the hill that is before jerusalem and for molech the abomination of the children of ammon 118 and likewise did he for all his strange wives which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods 119 and the lord was angry with solomon because his heart was turned from the lord god of israel which had appeared unto him twice 1110 and had commanded him concerning this thing that he should not go after other gods but he kept not that which the lord commanded 1111 wherefore the lord said unto solomon forasmuch as this is done of thee and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes which i have commanded thee i will surely rend the kingdom from thee and will give it to thy servant 1112 notwithstanding in thy days i will not do it for david thy fathers sake but i will rend it out of the hand of thy son 1113 howbeit i will not rend away all the kingdom but will give one tribe to thy son for david my servants sake and for jerusalems sake which i have chosen 1114 and the lord stirred up an adversary unto solomon hadad the edomite he was of the kings seed in edom 1115 for it came to pass when david was in edom and joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain after he had smitten every male in edom 1116 for six months did joab remain there with all israel until he had cut off every male in edom 1117 that hadad fled he and certain edomites of his fathers servants with him to go into egypt hadad being yet a little child 1118 and they arose out of midian and came to paran and they took men with them out of paran and they came to egypt unto pharaoh king of egypt which gave him an house and appointed him victuals and gave him land 1119 and hadad found great favour in the sight of pharaoh so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife the sister of tahpenes the queen 1120 and the sister of tahpenes bare him genubath his son whom tahpenes weaned in pharaohs house and genubath was in pharaohs household among the sons of pharaoh 1121 and when hadad heard in egypt that david slept with his fathers and that joab the captain of the host was dead hadad said to pharaoh let me depart that i may go to mine own country 1122 then pharaoh said unto him but what hast thou lacked with me that behold thou seekest to go to thine own country and he answered nothing howbeit let me go in any wise 1123 and god stirred him up another adversary rezon the son of eliadah which fled from his lord hadadezer king of zobah 1124 and he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band when david slew them of zobah and they went to damascus and dwelt therein and reigned in damascus 1125 and he was an adversary to israel all the days of solomon beside the mischief that hadad did and he abhorred israel and reigned over syria 1126 and jeroboam the son of nebat an ephrathite of zereda solomons servant whose mothers name was zeruah a widow woman even he lifted up his hand against the king 1127 and this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king solomon built millo and repaired the breaches of the city of david his father 1128 and the man jeroboam was a mighty man of valour and solomon seeing the young man that he was industrious he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of joseph 1129 and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out of jerusalem that the prophet ahijah the shilonite found him in the way and he had clad himself with a new garment and they two were alone in the field 1130 and ahijah caught the new garment that was on him and rent it in twelve pieces 1131 and he said to jeroboam take thee ten pieces for thus saith the lord the god of israel behold i will rend the kingdom out of the hand of solomon and will give ten tribes to thee 1132 but he shall have one tribe for my servant davids sake and for jerusalems sake the city which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel 1133 because that they have forsaken me and have worshipped ashtoreth the goddess of the zidonians chemosh the god of the moabites and milcom the god of the children of ammon and have not walked in my ways to do that which is right in mine eyes and to keep my statutes and my judgments as did david his father 1134 howbeit i will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand but i will make him prince all the days of his life for david my servants sake whom i chose because he kept my commandments and my statutes 1135 but i will take the kingdom out of his sons hand and will give it unto thee even ten tribes 1136 and unto his son will i give one tribe that david my servant may have a light alway before me in jerusalem the city which i have chosen me to put my name there 1137 and i will take thee and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth and shalt be king over israel 1138 and it shall be if thou wilt hearken unto all that i command thee and wilt walk in my ways and do that is right in my sight to keep my statutes and my commandments as david my servant did that i will be with thee and build thee a sure house as i built for david and will give israel unto thee 1139 and i will for this afflict the seed of david but not for ever 1140 solomon sought therefore to kill jeroboam and jeroboam arose and fled into egypt unto shishak king of egypt and was in egypt until the death of solomon 1141 and the rest of the acts of solomon and all that he did and his wisdom are they not written in the book of the acts of solomon 1142 and the time that solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel was forty years 1143 and solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead 121 and rehoboam went to shechem for all israel were come to shechem to make him king 122 and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was yet in egypt heard of it for he was fled from the presence of king solomon and jeroboam dwelt in egypt 123 that they sent and called him and jeroboam and all the congregation of israel came and spake unto rehoboam saying 124 thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee 125 and he said unto them depart yet for three days then come again to me and the people departed 126 and king rehoboam consulted with the old men that stood before solomon his father while he yet lived and said how do ye advise that i may answer this people 127 and they spake unto him saying if thou wilt be a servant unto this people this day and wilt serve them and answer them and speak good words to them then they will be thy servants for ever 128 but he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him and which stood before him 129 and he said unto them what counsel give ye that we may answer this people who have spoken to me saying make the yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter 1210 and the young men that were grown up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it lighter unto us thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my fathers loins 1211 and now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke i will add to your yoke my father hath chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions 1212 so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam the third day as the king had appointed saying come to me again the third day 1213 and the king answered the people roughly and forsook the old mens counsel that they gave him 1214 and spake to them after the counsel of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy and i will add to your yoke my father also chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions 1215 wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was from the lord that he might perform his saying which the lord spake by ahijah the shilonite unto jeroboam the son of nebat 1216 so when all israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse to your tents o israel now see to thine own house david so israel departed unto their tents 1217 but as for the children of israel which dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them 1218 then king rehoboam sent adoram who was over the tribute and all israel stoned him with stones that he died therefore king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem 1219 so israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day 1220 and it came to pass when all israel heard that jeroboam was come again that they sent and called him unto the congregation and made him king over all israel there was none that followed the house of david but the tribe of judah only 1221 and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he assembled all the house of judah with the tribe of benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against the house of israel to bring the kingdom again to rehoboam the son of solomon 1222 but the word of god came unto shemaiah the man of god saying 1223 speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and unto all the house of judah and benjamin and to the remnant of the people saying 1224 thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren the children of israel return every man to his house for this thing is from me they hearkened therefore to the word of the lord and returned to depart according to the word of the lord 1225 then jeroboam built shechem in mount ephraim and dwelt therein and went out from thence and built penuel 1226 and jeroboam said in his heart now shall the kingdom return to the house of david 1227 if this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the lord at jerusalem then shall the heart of this people turn again unto their lord even unto rehoboam king of judah and they shall kill me and go again to rehoboam king of judah 1228 whereupon the king took counsel and made two calves of gold and said unto them it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem behold thy gods o israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt 1229 and he set the one in bethel and the other put he in dan 1230 and this thing became a sin for the people went to worship before the one even unto dan 1231 and he made an house of high places and made priests of the lowest of the people which were not of the sons of levi 1232 and jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month like unto the feast that is in judah and he offered upon the altar so did he in bethel sacrificing unto the calves that he had made and he placed in bethel the priests of the high places which he had made 1233 so he offered upon the altar which he had made in bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month even in the month which he had devised of his own heart and ordained a feast unto the children of israel and he offered upon the altar and burnt incense 131 and behold there came a man of god out of judah by the word of the lord unto bethel and jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense 132 and he cried against the altar in the word of the lord and said o altar altar thus saith the lord behold a child shall be born unto the house of david josiah by name and upon thee shall he offer the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee and mens bones shall be burnt upon thee 133 and he gave a sign the same day saying this is the sign which the lord hath spoken behold the altar shall be rent and the ashes that are upon it shall be poured out 134 and it came to pass when king jeroboam heard the saying of the man of god which had cried against the altar in bethel that he put forth his hand from the altar saying lay hold on him and his hand which he put forth against him dried up so that he could not pull it in again to him 135 the altar also was rent and the ashes poured out from the altar according to the sign which the man of god had given by the word of the lord 136 and the king answered and said unto the man of god intreat now the face of the lord thy god and pray for me that my hand may be restored me again and the man of god besought the lord and the kings hand was restored him again and became as it was before 137 and the king said unto the man of god come home with me and refresh thyself and i will give thee a reward 138 and the man of god said unto the king if thou wilt give me half thine house i will not go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water in this place 139 for so was it charged me by the word of the lord saying eat no bread nor drink water nor turn again by the same way that thou camest 1310 so he went another way and returned not by the way that he came to bethel 1311 now there dwelt an old prophet in bethel and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of god had done that day in bethel the words which he had spoken unto the king them they told also to their father 1312 and their father said unto them what way went he for his sons had seen what way the man of god went which came from judah 1313 and he said unto his sons saddle me the ass so they saddled him the ass and he rode thereon 1314 and went after the man of god and found him sitting under an oak and he said unto him art thou the man of god that camest from judah and he said i am 1315 then he said unto him come home with me and eat bread 1316 and he said i may not return with thee nor go in with thee neither will i eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place 1317 for it was said to me by the word of the lord thou shalt eat no bread nor drink water there nor turn again to go by the way that thou camest 1318 he said unto him i am a prophet also as thou art and an angel spake unto me by the word of the lord saying bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but he lied unto him 1319 so he went back with him and did eat bread in his house and drank water 1320 and it came to pass as they sat at the table that the word of the lord came unto the prophet that brought him back 1321 and he cried unto the man of god that came from judah saying thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the lord and hast not kept the commandment which the lord thy god commanded thee 1322 but camest back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place of the which the lord did say to thee eat no bread and drink no water thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers 1323 and it came to pass after he had eaten bread and after he had drunk that he saddled for him the ass to wit for the prophet whom he had brought back 1324 and when he was gone a lion met him by the way and slew him and his carcase was cast in the way and the ass stood by it the lion also stood by the carcase 1325 and behold men passed by and saw the carcase cast in the way and the lion standing by the carcase and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt 1326 and when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard thereof he said it is the man of god who was disobedient unto the word of the lord therefore the lord hath delivered him unto the lion which hath torn him and slain him according to the word of the lord which he spake unto him 1327 and he spake to his sons saying saddle me the ass and they saddled him 1328 and he went and found his carcase cast in the way and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase the lion had not eaten the carcase nor torn the ass 1329 and the prophet took up the carcase of the man of god and laid it upon the ass and brought it back and the old prophet came to the city to mourn and to bury him 1330 and he laid his carcase in his own grave and they mourned over him saying alas my brother 1331 and it came to pass after he had buried him that he spake to his sons saying when i am dead then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of god is buried lay my bones beside his bones 1332 for the saying which he cried by the word of the lord against the altar in bethel and against all the houses of the high places which are in the cities of samaria shall surely come to pass 1333 after this thing jeroboam returned not from his evil way but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places whosoever would he consecrated him and he became one of the priests of the high places 1334 and this thing became sin unto the house of jeroboam even to cut it off and to destroy it from off the face of the earth 141 at that time abijah the son of jeroboam fell sick 142 and jeroboam said to his wife arise i pray thee and disguise thyself that thou be not known to be the wife of jeroboam and get thee to shiloh behold there is ahijah the prophet which told me that i should be king over this people 143 and take with thee ten loaves and cracknels and a cruse of honey and go to him he shall tell thee what shall become of the child 144 and jeroboams wife did so and arose and went to shiloh and came to the house of ahijah but ahijah could not see for his eyes were set by reason of his age 145 and the lord said unto ahijah behold the wife of jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son for he is sick thus and thus shalt thou say unto her for it shall be when she cometh in that she shall feign herself to be another woman 146 and it was so when ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door that he said come in thou wife of jeroboam why feignest thou thyself to be another for i am sent to thee with heavy tidings 147 go tell jeroboam thus saith the lord god of israel forasmuch as i exalted thee from among the people and made thee prince over my people israel 148 and rent the kingdom away from the house of david and gave it thee and yet thou hast not been as my servant david who kept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do that only which was right in mine eyes 149 but hast done evil above all that were before thee for thou hast gone and made thee other gods and molten images to provoke me to anger and hast cast me behind thy back 1410 therefore behold i will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam and will cut off from jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel and will take away the remnant of the house of jeroboam as a man taketh away dung till it be all gone 1411 him that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat for the lord hath spoken it 1412 arise thou therefore get thee to thine own house and when thy feet enter into the city the child shall die 1413 and all israel shall mourn for him and bury him for he only of jeroboam shall come to the grave because in him there is found some good thing toward the lord god of israel in the house of jeroboam 1414 moreover the lord shall raise him up a king over israel who shall cut off the house of jeroboam that day but what even now 1415 for the lord shall smite israel as a reed is shaken in the water and he shall root up israel out of this good land which he gave to their fathers and shall scatter them beyond the river because they have made their groves provoking the lord to anger 1416 and he shall give israel up because of the sins of jeroboam who did sin and who made israel to sin 1417 and jeroboams wife arose and departed and came to tirzah and when she came to the threshold of the door the child died 1418 and they buried him and all israel mourned for him according to the word of the lord which he spake by the hand of his servant ahijah the prophet 1419 and the rest of the acts of jeroboam how he warred and how he reigned behold they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 1420 and the days which jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years and he slept with his fathers and nadab his son reigned in his stead 1421 and rehoboam the son of solomon reigned in judah rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord did choose out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mothers name was naamah an ammonitess 1422 and judah did evil in the sight of the lord and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed above all that their fathers had done 1423 for they also built them high places and images and groves on every high hill and under every green tree 1424 and there were also sodomites in the land and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the lord cast out before the children of israel 1425 and it came to pass in the fifth year of king rehoboam that shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem 1426 and he took away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings house he even took away all and he took away all the shields of gold which solomon had made 1427 and king rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard which kept the door of the kings house 1428 and it was so when the king went into the house of the lord that the guard bare them and brought them back into the guard chamber 1429 now the rest of the acts of rehoboam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 1430 and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all their days 1431 and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and his mothers name was naamah an ammonitess and abijam his son reigned in his stead 151 now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam the son of nebat reigned abijam over judah 152 three years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was maachah the daughter of abishalom 153 and he walked in all the sins of his father which he had done before him and his heart was not perfect with the lord his god as the heart of david his father 154 nevertheless for davids sake did the lord his god give him a lamp in jerusalem to set up his son after him and to establish jerusalem 155 because david did that which was right in the eyes of the lord and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life save only in the matter of uriah the hittite 156 and there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam all the days of his life 157 now the rest of the acts of abijam and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah and there was war between abijam and jeroboam 158 and abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead 159 and in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel reigned asa over judah 1510 and forty and one years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was maachah the daughter of abishalom 1511 and asa did that which was right in the eyes of the lord as did david his father 1512 and he took away the sodomites out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made 1513 and also maachah his mother even her he removed from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove and asa destroyed her idol and burnt it by the brook kidron 1514 but the high places were not removed nevertheless asas heart was perfect with the lord all his days 1515 and he brought in the things which his father had dedicated and the things which himself had dedicated into the house of the lord silver and gold and vessels 1516 and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days 1517 and baasha king of israel went up against judah and built ramah that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to asa king of judah 1518 then asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings house and delivered them into the hand of his servants and king asa sent them to benhadad the son of tabrimon the son of hezion king of syria that dwelt at damascus saying 1519 there is a league between me and thee and between my father and thy father behold i have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold come and break thy league with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me 1520 so benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of the hosts which he had against the cities of israel and smote ijon and dan and abelbethmaachah and all cinneroth with all the land of naphtali 1521 and it came to pass when baasha heard thereof that he left off building of ramah and dwelt in tirzah 1522 then king asa made a proclamation throughout all judah none was exempted and they took away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha had builded and king asa built with them geba of benjamin and mizpah 1523 the rest of all the acts of asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities which he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah nevertheless in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet 1524 and asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead 1525 and nadab the son of jeroboam began to reign over israel in the second year of asa king of judah and reigned over israel two years 1526 and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of his father and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin 1527 and baasha the son of ahijah of the house of issachar conspired against him and baasha smote him at gibbethon which belonged to the philistines for nadab and all israel laid siege to gibbethon 1528 even in the third year of asa king of judah did baasha slay him and reigned in his stead 1529 and it came to pass when he reigned that he smote all the house of jeroboam he left not to jeroboam any that breathed until he had destroyed him according unto the saying of the lord which he spake by his servant ahijah the shilonite 1530 because of the sins of jeroboam which he sinned and which he made israel sin by his provocation wherewith he provoked the lord god of israel to anger 1531 now the rest of the acts of nadab and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 1532 and there was war between asa and baasha king of israel all their days 1533 in the third year of asa king of judah began baasha the son of ahijah to reign over all israel in tirzah twenty and four years 1534 and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of jeroboam and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin 161 then the word of the lord came to jehu the son of hanani against baasha saying 162 forasmuch as i exalted thee out of the dust and made thee prince over my people israel and thou hast walked in the way of jeroboam and hast made my people israel to sin to provoke me to anger with their sins 163 behold i will take away the posterity of baasha and the posterity of his house and will make thy house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat 164 him that dieth of baasha in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat 165 now the rest of the acts of baasha and what he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 166 so baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in tirzah and elah his son reigned in his stead 167 and also by the hand of the prophet jehu the son of hanani came the word of the lord against baasha and against his house even for all the evil that he did in the sight of the lord in provoking him to anger with the work of his hands in being like the house of jeroboam and because he killed him 168 in the twenty and sixth year of asa king of judah began elah the son of baasha to reign over israel in tirzah two years 169 and his servant zimri captain of half his chariots conspired against him as he was in tirzah drinking himself drunk in the house of arza steward of his house in tirzah 1610 and zimri went in and smote him and killed him in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah and reigned in his stead 1611 and it came to pass when he began to reign as soon as he sat on his throne that he slew all the house of baasha he left him not one that pisseth against a wall neither of his kinsfolks nor of his friends 1612 thus did zimri destroy all the house of baasha according to the word of the lord which he spake against baasha by jehu the prophet 1613 for all the sins of baasha and the sins of elah his son by which they sinned and by which they made israel to sin in provoking the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities 1614 now the rest of the acts of elah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 1615 in the twenty and seventh year of asa king of judah did zimri reign seven days in tirzah and the people were encamped against gibbethon which belonged to the philistines 1616 and the people that were encamped heard say zimri hath conspired and hath also slain the king wherefore all israel made omri the captain of the host king over israel that day in the camp 1617 and omri went up from gibbethon and all israel with him and they besieged tirzah 1618 and it came to pass when zimri saw that the city was taken that he went into the palace of the kings house and burnt the kings house over him with fire and died 1619 for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the lord in walking in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he did to make israel to sin 1620 now the rest of the acts of zimri and his treason that he wrought are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 1621 then were the people of israel divided into two parts half of the people followed tibni the son of ginath to make him king and half followed omri 1622 but the people that followed omri prevailed against the people that followed tibni the son of ginath so tibni died and omri reigned 1623 in the thirty and first year of asa king of judah began omri to reign over israel twelve years six years reigned he in tirzah 1624 and he bought the hill samaria of shemer for two talents of silver and built on the hill and called the name of the city which he built after the name of shemer owner of the hill samaria 1625 but omri wrought evil in the eyes of the lord and did worse than all that were before him 1626 for he walked in all the way of jeroboam the son of nebat and in his sin wherewith he made israel to sin to provoke the lord god of israel to anger with their vanities 1627 now the rest of the acts of omri which he did and his might that he shewed are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 1628 so omri slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria and ahab his son reigned in his stead 1629 and in the thirty and eighth year of asa king of judah began ahab the son of omri to reign over israel and ahab the son of omri reigned over israel in samaria twenty and two years 1630 and ahab the son of omri did evil in the sight of the lord above all that were before him 1631 and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took to wife jezebel the daughter of ethbaal king of the zidonians and went and served baal and worshipped him 1632 and he reared up an altar for baal in the house of baal which he had built in samaria 1633 and ahab made a grove and ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him 1634 in his days did hiel the bethelite build jericho he laid the foundation thereof in abiram his firstborn and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son segub according to the word of the lord which he spake by joshua the son of nun 171 and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab as the lord god of israel liveth before whom i stand there shall not be dew nor rain these years but according to my word 172 and the word of the lord came unto him saying 173 get thee hence and turn thee eastward and hide thyself by the brook cherith that is before jordan 174 and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the brook and i have commanded the ravens to feed thee there 175 so he went and did according unto the word of the lord for he went and dwelt by the brook cherith that is before jordan 176 and the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook 177 and it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land 178 and the word of the lord came unto him saying 179 arise get thee to zarephath which belongeth to zidon and dwell there behold i have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee 1710 so he arose and went to zarephath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there gathering of sticks and he called to her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink 1711 and as she was going to fetch it he called to her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand 1712 and she said as the lord thy god liveth i have not a cake but an handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die 1713 and elijah said unto her fear not go and do as thou hast said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son 1714 for thus saith the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the lord sendeth rain upon the earth 1715 and she went and did according to the saying of elijah and she and he and her house did eat many days 1716 and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spake by elijah 1717 and it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman the mistress of the house fell sick and his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him 1718 and she said unto elijah what have i to do with thee o thou man of god art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son 1719 and he said unto her give me thy son and he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into a loft where he abode and laid him upon his own bed 1720 and he cried unto the lord and said o lord my god hast thou also brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn by slaying her son 1721 and he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto the lord and said o lord my god i pray thee let this childs soul come into him again 1722 and the lord heard the voice of elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived 1723 and elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and elijah said see thy son liveth 1724 and the woman said to elijah now by this i know that thou art a man of god and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth 181 and it came to pass after many days that the word of the lord came to elijah in the third year saying go shew thyself unto ahab and i will send rain upon the earth 182 and elijah went to shew himself unto ahab and there was a sore famine in samaria 183 and ahab called obadiah which was the governor of his house now obadiah feared the lord greatly 184 for it was so when jezebel cut off the prophets of the lord that obadiah took an hundred prophets and hid them by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water 185 and ahab said unto obadiah go into the land unto all fountains of water and unto all brooks peradventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the beasts 186 so they divided the land between them to pass throughout it ahab went one way by himself and obadiah went another way by himself 187 and as obadiah was in the way behold elijah met him and he knew him and fell on his face and said art thou that my lord elijah 188 and he answered him i am go tell thy lord behold elijah is here 189 and he said what have i sinned that thou wouldest deliver thy servant into the hand of ahab to slay me 1810 as the lord thy god liveth there is no nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee and when they said he is not there he took an oath of the kingdom and nation that they found thee not 1811 and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here 1812 and it shall come to pass as soon as i am gone from thee that the spirit of the lord shall carry thee whither i know not and so when i come and tell ahab and he cannot find thee he shall slay me but i thy servant fear the lord from my youth 1813 was it not told my lord what i did when jezebel slew the prophets of the lord how i hid an hundred men of the lords prophets by fifty in a cave and fed them with bread and water 1814 and now thou sayest go tell thy lord behold elijah is here and he shall slay me 1815 and elijah said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand i will surely shew myself unto him to day 1816 so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to meet elijah 1817 and it came to pass when ahab saw elijah that ahab said unto him art thou he that troubleth israel 1818 and he answered i have not troubled israel but thou and thy fathers house in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the lord and thou hast followed baalim 1819 now therefore send and gather to me all israel unto mount carmel and the prophets of baal four hundred and fifty and the prophets of the groves four hundred which eat at jezebels table 1820 so ahab sent unto all the children of israel and gathered the prophets together unto mount carmel 1821 and elijah came unto all the people and said how long halt ye between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him and the people answered him not a word 1822 then said elijah unto the people i even i only remain a prophet of the lord but baals prophets are four hundred and fifty men 1823 let them therefore give us two bullocks and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under and i will dress the other bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under 1824 and call ye on the name of your gods and i will call on the name of the lord and the god that answereth by fire let him be god and all the people answered and said it is well spoken 1825 and elijah said unto the prophets of baal choose you one bullock for yourselves and dress it first for ye are many and call on the name of your gods but put no fire under 1826 and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon saying o baal hear us but there was no voice nor any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made 1827 and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he is a god either he is talking or he is pursuing or he is in a journey or peradventure he sleepeth and must be awaked 1828 and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them 1829 and it came to pass when midday was past and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded 1830 and elijah said unto all the people come near unto me and all the people came near unto him and he repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down 1831 and elijah took twelve stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word of the lord came saying israel shall be thy name 1832 and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed 1833 and he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood 1834 and he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and he said do it the third time and they did it the third time 1835 and the water ran round about the altar and he filled the trench also with water 1836 and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word 1837 hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou hast turned their heart back again 1838 then the fire of the lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench 1839 and when all the people saw it they fell on their faces and they said the lord he is the god the lord he is the god 1840 and elijah said unto them take the prophets of baal let not one of them escape and they took them and elijah brought them down to the brook kishon and slew them there 1841 and elijah said unto ahab get thee up eat and drink for there is a sound of abundance of rain 1842 so ahab went up to eat and to drink and elijah went up to the top of carmel and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees 1843 and said to his servant go up now look toward the sea and he went up and looked and said there is nothing and he said go again seven times 1844 and it came to pass at the seventh time that he said behold there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea like a mans hand and he said go up say unto ahab prepare thy chariot and get thee down that the rain stop thee not 1845 and it came to pass in the mean while that the heaven was black with clouds and wind and there was a great rain and ahab rode and went to jezreel 1846 and the hand of the lord was on elijah and he girded up his loins and ran before ahab to the entrance of jezreel 191 and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword 192 then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time 193 and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there 194 but he himself went a days journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now o lord take away my life for i am not better than my fathers 195 and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto him arise and eat 196 and he looked and behold there was a cake baken on the coals and a cruse of water at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again 197 and the angel of the lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee 198 and he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights unto horeb the mount of god 199 and he came thither unto a cave and lodged there and behold the word of the lord came to him and he said unto him what doest thou here elijah 1910 and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts for the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away 1911 and he said go forth and stand upon the mount before the lord and behold the lord passed by and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and brake in pieces the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake 1912 and after the earthquake a fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice 1913 and it was so when elijah heard it that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto him and said what doest thou here elijah 1914 and he said i have been very jealous for the lord god of hosts because the children of israel have forsaken thy covenant thrown down thine altars and slain thy prophets with the sword and i even i only am left and they seek my life to take it away 1915 and the lord said unto him go return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus and when thou comest anoint hazael to be king over syria 1916 and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel and elisha the son of shaphat of abelmeholah shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room 1917 and it shall come to pass that him that escapeth the sword of hazael shall jehu slay and him that escapeth from the sword of jehu shall elisha slay 1918 yet i have left me seven thousand in israel all the knees which have not bowed unto baal and every mouth which hath not kissed him 1919 so he departed thence and found elisha the son of shaphat who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him and he with the twelfth and elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him 1920 and he left the oxen and ran after elijah and said let me i pray thee kiss my father and my mother and then i will follow thee and he said unto him go back again for what have i done to thee 1921 and he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and gave unto the people and they did eat then he arose and went after elijah and ministered unto him 201 and benhadad the king of syria gathered all his host together and there were thirty and two kings with him and horses and chariots and he went up and besieged samaria and warred against it 202 and he sent messengers to ahab king of israel into the city and said unto him thus saith benhadad 203 thy silver and thy gold is mine thy wives also and thy children even the goodliest are mine 204 and the king of israel answered and said my lord o king according to thy saying i am thine and all that i have 205 and the messengers came again and said thus speaketh benhadad saying although i have sent unto thee saying thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children 206 yet i will send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time and they shall search thine house and the houses of thy servants and it shall be that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes they shall put it in their hand and take it away 207 then the king of israel called all the elders of the land and said mark i pray you and see how this man seeketh mischief for he sent unto me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and for my gold and i denied him not 208 and all the elders and all the people said unto him hearken not unto him nor consent 209 wherefore he said unto the messengers of benhadad tell my lord the king all that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first i will do but this thing i may not do and the messengers departed and brought him word again 2010 and benhadad sent unto him and said the gods do so unto me and more also if the dust of samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people that follow me 2011 and the king of israel answered and said tell him let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off 2012 and it came to pass when benhadad heard this message as he was drinking he and the kings in the pavilions that he said unto his servants set yourselves in array and they set themselves in array against the city 2013 and behold there came a prophet unto ahab king of israel saying thus saith the lord hast thou seen all this great multitude behold i will deliver it into thine hand this day and thou shalt know that i am the lord 2014 and ahab said by whom and he said thus saith the lord even by the young men of the princes of the provinces then he said who shall order the battle and he answered thou 2015 then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces and they were two hundred and thirty two and after them he numbered all the people even all the children of israel being seven thousand 2016 and they went out at noon but benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions he and the kings the thirty and two kings that helped him 2017 and the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first and benhadad sent out and they told him saying there are men come out of samaria 2018 and he said whether they be come out for peace take them alive or whether they be come out for war take them alive 2019 so these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city and the army which followed them 2020 and they slew every one his man and the syrians fled and israel pursued them and benhadad the king of syria escaped on an horse with the horsemen 2021 and the king of israel went out and smote the horses and chariots and slew the syrians with a great slaughter 2022 and the prophet came to the king of israel and said unto him go strengthen thyself and mark and see what thou doest for at the return of the year the king of syria will come up against thee 2023 and the servants of the king of syria said unto him their gods are gods of the hills therefore they were stronger than we but let us fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they 2024 and do this thing take the kings away every man out of his place and put captains in their rooms 2025 and number thee an army like the army that thou hast lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot and we will fight against them in the plain and surely we shall be stronger than they and he hearkened unto their voice and did so 2026 and it came to pass at the return of the year that benhadad numbered the syrians and went up to aphek to fight against israel 2027 and the children of israel were numbered and were all present and went against them and the children of israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids but the syrians filled the country 2028 and there came a man of god and spake unto the king of israel and said thus saith the lord because the syrians have said the lord is god of the hills but he is not god of the valleys therefore will i deliver all this great multitude into thine hand and ye shall know that i am the lord 2029 and they pitched one over against the other seven days and so it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined and the children of israel slew of the syrians an hundred thousand footmen in one day 2030 but the rest fled to aphek into the city and there a wall fell upon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left and benhadad fled and came into the city into an inner chamber 2031 and his servants said unto him behold now we have heard that the kings of the house of israel are merciful kings let us i pray thee put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out to the king of israel peradventure he will save thy life 2032 so they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads and came to the king of israel and said thy servant benhadad saith i pray thee let me live and he said is he yet alive he is my brother 2033 now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would come from him and did hastily catch it and they said thy brother benhadad then he said go ye bring him then benhadad came forth to him and he caused him to come up into the chariot 2034 and benhadad said unto him the cities which my father took from thy father i will restore and thou shalt make streets for thee in damascus as my father made in samaria then said ahab i will send thee away with this covenant so he made a covenant with him and sent him away 2035 and a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour in the word of the lord smite me i pray thee and the man refused to smite him 2036 then said he unto him because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the lord behold as soon as thou art departed from me a lion shall slay thee and as soon as he was departed from him a lion found him and slew him 2037 then he found another man and said smite me i pray thee and the man smote him so that in smiting he wounded him 2038 so the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and disguised himself with ashes upon his face 2039 and as the king passed by he cried unto the king and he said thy servant went out into the midst of the battle and behold a man turned aside and brought a man unto me and said keep this man if by any means he be missing then shall thy life be for his life or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver 2040 and as thy servant was busy here and there he was gone and the king of israel said unto him so shall thy judgment be thyself hast decided it 2041 and he hasted and took the ashes away from his face and the king of israel discerned him that he was of the prophets 2042 and he said unto him thus saith the lord because thou hast let go out of thy hand a man whom i appointed to utter destruction therefore thy life shall go for his life and thy people for his people 2043 and the king of israel went to his house heavy and displeased and came to samaria 211 and it came to pass after these things that naboth the jezreelite had a vineyard which was in jezreel hard by the palace of ahab king of samaria 212 and ahab spake unto naboth saying give me thy vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and i will give thee for it a better vineyard than it or if it seem good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money 213 and naboth said to ahab the lord forbid it me that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee 214 and ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which naboth the jezreelite had spoken to him for he had said i will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread 215 but jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is thy spirit so sad that thou eatest no bread 216 and he said unto her because i spake unto naboth the jezreelite and said unto him give me thy vineyard for money or else if it please thee i will give thee another vineyard for it and he answered i will not give thee my vineyard 217 and jezebel his wife said unto him dost thou now govern the kingdom of israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be merry i will give thee the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite 218 so she wrote letters in ahabs name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city dwelling with naboth 219 and she wrote in the letters saying proclaim a fast and set naboth on high among the people 2110 and set two men sons of belial before him to bear witness against him saying thou didst blaspheme god and the king and then carry him out and stone him that he may die 2111 and the men of his city even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city did as jezebel had sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them 2112 they proclaimed a fast and set naboth on high among the people 2113 and there came in two men children of belial and sat before him and the men of belial witnessed against him even against naboth in the presence of the people saying naboth did blaspheme god and the king then they carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with stones that he died 2114 then they sent to jezebel saying naboth is stoned and is dead 2115 and it came to pass when jezebel heard that naboth was stoned and was dead that jezebel said to ahab arise take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite which he refused to give thee for money for naboth is not alive but dead 2116 and it came to pass when ahab heard that naboth was dead that ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite to take possession of it 2117 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying 2118 arise go down to meet ahab king of israel which is in samaria behold he is in the vineyard of naboth whither he is gone down to possess it 2119 and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord hast thou killed and also taken possession and thou shalt speak unto him saying thus saith the lord in the place where dogs licked the blood of naboth shall dogs lick thy blood even thine 2120 and ahab said to elijah hast thou found me o mine enemy and he answered i have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the lord 2121 behold i will bring evil upon thee and will take away thy posterity and will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel 2122 and will make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah for the provocation wherewith thou hast provoked me to anger and made israel to sin 2123 and of jezebel also spake the lord saying the dogs shall eat jezebel by the wall of jezreel 2124 him that dieth of ahab in the city the dogs shall eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat 2125 but there was none like unto ahab which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the lord whom jezebel his wife stirred up 2126 and he did very abominably in following idols according to all things as did the amorites whom the lord cast out before the children of israel 2127 and it came to pass when ahab heard those words that he rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went softly 2128 and the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite saying 2129 seest thou how ahab humbleth himself before me because he humbleth himself before me i will not bring the evil in his days but in his sons days will i bring the evil upon his house 221 and they continued three years without war between syria and israel 222 and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel 223 and the king of israel said unto his servants know ye that ramoth in gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the hand of the king of syria 224 and he said unto jehoshaphat wilt thou go with me to battle to ramothgilead and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i am as thou art my people as thy people my horses as thy horses 225 and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i pray thee at the word of the lord to day 226 then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about four hundred men and said unto them shall i go against ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king 227 and jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might enquire of him 228 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man micaiah the son of imlah by whom we may enquire of the lord but i hate him for he doth not prophesy good concerning me but evil and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so 229 then the king of israel called an officer and said hasten hither micaiah the son of imlah 2210 and the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah sat each on his throne having put on their robes in a void place in the entrance of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them 2211 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah made him horns of iron and he said thus saith the lord with these shalt thou push the syrians until thou have consumed them 2212 and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the kings hand 2213 and the messenger that was gone to call micaiah spake unto him saying behold now the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth let thy word i pray thee be like the word of one of them and speak that which is good 2214 and micaiah said as the lord liveth what the lord saith unto me that will i speak 2215 so he came to the king and the king said unto him micaiah shall we go against ramothgilead to battle or shall we forbear and he answered him go and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king 2216 and the king said unto him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the lord 2217 and he said i saw all israel scattered upon the hills as sheep that have not a shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return every man to his house in peace 2218 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would prophesy no good concerning me but evil 2219 and he said hear thou therefore the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left 2220 and the lord said who shall persuade ahab that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one said on this manner and another said on that manner 2221 and there came forth a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will persuade him 2222 and the lord said unto him wherewith and he said i will go forth and i will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and he said thou shalt persude him and prevail also go forth and do so 2223 now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil concerning thee 2224 but zedekiah the son of chenaanah went near and smote micaiah on the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee 2225 and micaiah said behold thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself 2226 and the king of israel said take micaiah and carry him back unto amon the governor of the city and to joash the kings son 2227 and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i come in peace 2228 and micaiah said if thou return at all in peace the lord hath not spoken by me and he said hearken o people every one of you 2229 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead 2230 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and enter into the battle but put thou on thy robes and the king of israel disguised himself and went into the battle 2231 but the king of syria commanded his thirty and two captains that had rule over his chariots saying fight neither with small nor great save only with the king of israel 2232 and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said surely it is the king of israel and they turned aside to fight against him and jehoshaphat cried out 2233 and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel that they turned back from pursuing him 2234 and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness wherefore he said unto the driver of his chariot turn thine hand and carry me out of the host for i am wounded 2235 and the battle increased that day and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the syrians and died at even and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot 2236 and there went a proclamation throughout the host about the going down of the sun saying every man to his city and every man to his own country 2237 so the king died and was brought to samaria and they buried the king in samaria 2238 and one washed the chariot in the pool of samaria and the dogs licked up his blood and they washed his armour according unto the word of the lord which he spake 2239 now the rest of the acts of ahab and all that he did and the ivory house which he made and all the cities that he built are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 2240 so ahab slept with his fathers and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead 2241 and jehoshaphat the son of asa began to reign over judah in the fourth year of ahab king of israel 2242 jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi 2243 and he walked in all the ways of asa his father he turned not aside from it doing that which was right in the eyes of the lord nevertheless the high places were not taken away for the people offered and burnt incense yet in the high places 2244 and jehoshaphat made peace with the king of israel 2245 now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat and his might that he shewed and how he warred are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 2246 and the remnant of the sodomites which remained in the days of his father asa he took out of the land 2247 there was then no king in edom a deputy was king 2248 jehoshaphat made ships of tharshish to go to ophir for gold but they went not for the ships were broken at eziongeber 2249 then said ahaziah the son of ahab unto jehoshaphat let my servants go with thy servants in the ships but jehoshaphat would not 2250 and jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david his father and jehoram his son reigned in his stead 2251 ahaziah the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned two years over israel 2252 and he did evil in the sight of the lord and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin 2253 for he served baal and worshipped him and provoked to anger the lord god of israel according to all that his father had done the second book of the kings commonly called the fourth book of the kings 11 then moab rebelled against israel after the death of ahab 12 and ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in samaria and was sick and he sent messengers and said unto them go enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron whether i shall recover of this disease 13 but the angel of the lord said to elijah the tishbite arise go up to meet the messengers of the king of samaria and say unto them is it not because there is not a god in israel that ye go to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron 14 now therefore thus saith the lord thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die and elijah departed 15 and when the messengers turned back unto him he said unto them why are ye now turned back 16 and they said unto him there came a man up to meet us and said unto us go turn again unto the king that sent you and say unto him thus saith the lord is it not because there is not a god in israel that thou sendest to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die 17 and he said unto them what manner of man was he which came up to meet you and told you these words 18 and they answered him he was an hairy man and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins and he said it is elijah the tishbite 19 then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty and he went up to him and behold he sat on the top of an hill and he spake unto him thou man of god the king hath said come down 110 and elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty if i be a man of god then let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty and there came down fire from heaven and consumed him and his fifty 111 again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty and he answered and said unto him o man of god thus hath the king said come down quickly 112 and elijah answered and said unto them if i be a man of god let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty and the fire of god came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty 113 and he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty and the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before elijah and besought him and said unto him o man of god i pray thee let my life and the life of these fifty thy servants be precious in thy sight 114 behold there came fire down from heaven and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight 115 and the angel of the lord said unto elijah go down with him be not afraid of him and he arose and went down with him unto the king 116 and he said unto him thus saith the lord forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of baalzebub the god of ekron is it not because there is no god in israel to enquire of his word therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die 117 so he died according to the word of the lord which elijah had spoken and jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of jehoram the son of jehoshaphat king of judah because he had no son 118 now the rest of the acts of ahaziah which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 21 and it came to pass when the lord would take up elijah into heaven by a whirlwind that elijah went with elisha from gilgal 22 and elijah said unto elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to bethel and elisha said unto him as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they went down to bethel 23 and the sons of the prophets that were at bethel came forth to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to day and he said yea i know it hold ye your peace 24 and elijah said unto him elisha tarry here i pray thee for the lord hath sent me to jericho and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee so they came to jericho 25 and the sons of the prophets that were at jericho came to elisha and said unto him knowest thou that the lord will take away thy master from thy head to day and he answered yea i know it hold ye your peace 26 and elijah said unto him tarry i pray thee here for the lord hath sent me to jordan and he said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and they two went on 27 and fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood to view afar off and they two stood by jordan 28 and elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters and they were divided hither and thither so that they two went over on dry ground 29 and it came to pass when they were gone over that elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall do for thee before i be taken away from thee and elisha said i pray thee let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me 210 and he said thou hast asked a hard thing nevertheless if thou see me when i am taken from thee it shall be so unto thee but if not it shall not be so 211 and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold there appeared a chariot of fire and horses of fire and parted them both asunder and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven 212 and elisha saw it and he cried my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces 213 he took up also the mantle of elijah that fell from him and went back and stood by the bank of jordan 214 and he took the mantle of elijah that fell from him and smote the waters and said where is the lord god of elijah and when he also had smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and elisha went over 215 and when the sons of the prophets which were to view at jericho saw him they said the spirit of elijah doth rest on elisha and they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him 216 and they said unto him behold now there be with thy servants fifty strong men let them go we pray thee and seek thy master lest peradventure the spirit of the lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley and he said ye shall not send 217 and when they urged him till he was ashamed he said send they sent therefore fifty men and they sought three days but found him not 218 and when they came again to him for he tarried at jericho he said unto them did i not say unto you go not 219 and the men of the city said unto elisha behold i pray thee the situation of this city is pleasant as my lord seeth but the water is naught and the ground barren 220 and he said bring me a new cruse and put salt therein and they brought it to him 221 and he went forth unto the spring of the waters and cast the salt in there and said thus saith the lord i have healed these waters there shall not be from thence any more death or barren land 222 so the waters were healed unto this day according to the saying of elisha which he spake 223 and he went up from thence unto bethel and as he was going up by the way there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him and said unto him go up thou bald head go up thou bald head 224 and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the lord and there came forth two she bears out of the wood and tare forty and two children of them 225 and he went from thence to mount carmel and from thence he returned to samaria 31 now jehoram the son of ahab began to reign over israel in samaria the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and reigned twelve years 32 and he wrought evil in the sight of the lord but not like his father and like his mother for he put away the image of baal that his father had made 33 nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat which made israel to sin he departed not therefrom 34 and mesha king of moab was a sheepmaster and rendered unto the king of israel an hundred thousand lambs and an hundred thousand rams with the wool 35 but it came to pass when ahab was dead that the king of moab rebelled against the king of israel 36 and king jehoram went out of samaria the same time and numbered all israel 37 and he went and sent to jehoshaphat the king of judah saying the king of moab hath rebelled against me wilt thou go with me against moab to battle and he said i will go up i am as thou art my people as thy people and my horses as thy horses 38 and he said which way shall we go up and he answered the way through the wilderness of edom 39 so the king of israel went and the king of judah and the king of edom and they fetched a compass of seven days journey and there was no water for the host and for the cattle that followed them 310 and the king of israel said alas that the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab 311 but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord that we may enquire of the lord by him and one of the king of israels servants answered and said here is elisha the son of shaphat which poured water on the hands of elijah 312 and jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him 313 and elisha said unto the king of israel what have i to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother and the king of israel said unto him nay for the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab 314 and elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see thee 315 but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him 316 and he said thus saith the lord make this valley full of ditches 317 for thus saith the lord ye shall not see wind neither shall ye see rain yet that valley shall be filled with water that ye may drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts 318 and this is but a light thing in the sight of the lord he will deliver the moabites also into your hand 319 and ye shall smite every fenced city and every choice city and shall fell every good tree and stop all wells of water and mar every good piece of land with stones 320 and it came to pass in the morning when the meat offering was offered that behold there came water by the way of edom and the country was filled with water 321 and when all the moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them they gathered all that were able to put on armour and upward and stood in the border 322 and they rose up early in the morning and the sun shone upon the water and the moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood 323 and they said this is blood the kings are surely slain and they have smitten one another now therefore moab to the spoil 324 and when they came to the camp of israel the israelites rose up and smote the moabites so that they fled before them but they went forward smiting the moabites even in their country 325 and they beat down the cities and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone and filled it and they stopped all the wells of water and felled all the good trees only in kirharaseth left they the stones thereof howbeit the slingers went about it and smote it 326 and when the king of moab saw that the battle was too sore for him he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords to break through even unto the king of edom but they could not 327 then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall and there was great indignation against israel and they departed from him and returned to their own land 41 now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto elisha saying thy servant my husband is dead and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the lord and the creditor is come to take unto him my two sons to be bondmen 42 and elisha said unto her what shall i do for thee tell me what hast thou in the house and she said thine handmaid hath not any thing in the house save a pot of oil 43 then he said go borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours even empty vessels borrow not a few 44 and when thou art come in thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and shalt pour out into all those vessels and thou shalt set aside that which is full 45 so she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons who brought the vessels to her and she poured out 46 and it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son bring me yet a vessel and he said unto her there is not a vessel more and the oil stayed 47 then she came and told the man of god and he said go sell the oil and pay thy debt and live thou and thy children of the rest 48 and it fell on a day that elisha passed to shunem where was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that as oft as he passed by he turned in thither to eat bread 49 and she said unto her husband behold now i perceive that this is an holy man of god which passeth by us continually 410 let us make a little chamber i pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a candlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn in thither 411 and it fell on a day that he came thither and he turned into the chamber and lay there 412 and he said to gehazi his servant call this shunammite and when he had called her she stood before him 413 and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou hast been careful for us with all this care what is to be done for thee wouldest thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host and she answered i dwell among mine own people 414 and he said what then is to be done for her and gehazi answered verily she hath no child and her husband is old 415 and he said call her and when he had called her she stood in the door 416 and he said about this season according to the time of life thou shalt embrace a son and she said nay my lord thou man of god do not lie unto thine handmaid 417 and the woman conceived and bare a son at that season that elisha had said unto her according to the time of life 418 and when the child was grown it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the reapers 419 and he said unto his father my head my head and he said to a lad carry him to his mother 420 and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then died 421 and she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of god and shut the door upon him and went out 422 and she called unto her husband and said send me i pray thee one of the young men and one of the asses that i may run to the man of god and come again 423 and he said wherefore wilt thou go to him to day it is neither new moon nor sabbath and she said it shall be well 424 then she saddled an ass and said to her servant drive and go forward slack not thy riding for me except i bid thee 425 so she went and came unto the man of god to mount carmel and it came to pass when the man of god saw her afar off that he said to gehazi his servant behold yonder is that shunammite 426 run now i pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with the child and she answered it is well 427 and when she came to the man of god to the hill she caught him by the feet but gehazi came near to thrust her away and the man of god said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and the lord hath hid it from me and hath not told me 428 then she said did i desire a son of my lord did i not say do not deceive me 429 then he said to gehazi gird up thy loins and take my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and lay my staff upon the face of the child 430 and the mother of the child said as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth i will not leave thee and he arose and followed her 431 and gehazi passed on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing wherefore he went again to meet him and told him saying the child is not awaked 432 and when elisha was come into the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed 433 he went in therefore and shut the door upon them twain and prayed unto the lord 434 and he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands and stretched himself upon the child and the flesh of the child waxed warm 435 then he returned and walked in the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes 436 and he called gehazi and said call this shunammite so he called her and when she was come in unto him he said take up thy son 437 then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out 438 and elisha came again to gilgal and there was a dearth in the land and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him and he said unto his servant set on the great pot and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets 439 and one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full and came and shred them into the pot of pottage for they knew them not 440 so they poured out for the men to eat and it came to pass as they were eating of the pottage that they cried out and said o thou man of god there is death in the pot and they could not eat thereof 441 but he said then bring meal and he cast it into the pot and he said pour out for the people that they may eat and there was no harm in the pot 442 and there came a man from baalshalisha and brought the man of god bread of the firstfruits twenty loaves of barley and full ears of corn in the husk thereof and he said give unto the people that they may eat 443 and his servitor said what should i set this before an hundred men he said again give the people that they may eat for thus saith the lord they shall eat and shall leave thereof 444 so he set it before them and they did eat and left thereof according to the word of the lord 51 now naaman captain of the host of the king of syria was a great man with his master and honourable because by him the lord had given deliverance unto syria he was also a mighty man in valour but he was a leper 52 and the syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of israel a little maid and she waited on naamans wife 53 and she said unto her mistress would god my lord were with the prophet that is in samaria for he would recover him of his leprosy 54 and one went in and told his lord saying thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of israel 55 and the king of syria said go to go and i will send a letter unto the king of israel and he departed and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold and ten changes of raiment 56 and he brought the letter to the king of israel saying now when this letter is come unto thee behold i have therewith sent naaman my servant to thee that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy 57 and it came to pass when the king of israel had read the letter that he rent his clothes and said am i god to kill and to make alive that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy wherefore consider i pray you and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me 58 and it was so when elisha the man of god had heard that the king of israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes let him come now to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in israel 59 so naaman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of elisha 510 and elisha sent a messenger unto him saying go and wash in jordan seven times and thy flesh shall come again to thee and thou shalt be clean 511 but naaman was wroth and went away and said behold i thought he will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the lord his god and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper 512 are not abana and pharpar rivers of damascus better than all the waters of israel may i not wash in them and be clean so he turned and went away in a rage 513 and his servants came near and spake unto him and said my father if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing wouldest thou not have done it how much rather then when he saith to thee wash and be clean 514 then went he down and dipped himself seven times in jordan according to the saying of the man of god and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child and he was clean 515 and he returned to the man of god he and all his company and came and stood before him and he said behold now i know that there is no god in all the earth but in israel now therefore i pray thee take a blessing of thy servant 516 but he said as the lord liveth before whom i stand i will receive none and he urged him to take it but he refused 517 and naaman said shall there not then i pray thee be given to thy servant two mules burden of earth for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto the lord 518 in this thing the lord pardon thy servant that when my master goeth into the house of rimmon to worship there and he leaneth on my hand and i bow myself in the house of rimmon when i bow down myself in the house of rimmon the lord pardon thy servant in this thing 519 and he said unto him go in peace so he departed from him a little way 520 but gehazi the servant of elisha the man of god said behold my master hath spared naaman this syrian in not receiving at his hands that which he brought but as the lord liveth i will run after him and take somewhat of him 521 so gehazi followed after naaman and when naaman saw him running after him he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said is all well 522 and he said all is well my master hath sent me saying behold even now there be come to me from mount ephraim two young men of the sons of the prophets give them i pray thee a talent of silver and two changes of garments 523 and naaman said be content take two talents and he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of garments and laid them upon two of his servants and they bare them before him 524 and when he came to the tower he took them from their hand and bestowed them in the house and he let the men go and they departed 525 but he went in and stood before his master and elisha said unto him whence comest thou gehazi and he said thy servant went no whither 526 and he said unto him went not mine heart with thee when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee is it a time to receive money and to receive garments and oliveyards and vineyards and sheep and oxen and menservants and maidservants 527 the leprosy therefore of naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed for ever and he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow 61 and the sons of the prophets said unto elisha behold now the place where we dwell with thee is too strait for us 62 let us go we pray thee unto jordan and take thence every man a beam and let us make us a place there where we may dwell and he answered go ye 63 and one said be content i pray thee and go with thy servants and he answered i will go 64 so he went with them and when they came to jordan they cut down wood 65 but as one was felling a beam the axe head fell into the water and he cried and said alas master for it was borrowed 66 and the man of god said where fell it and he shewed him the place and he cut down a stick and cast it in thither and the iron did swim 67 therefore said he take it up to thee and he put out his hand and took it 68 then the king of syria warred against israel and took counsel with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my camp 69 and the man of god sent unto the king of israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for thither the syrians are come down 610 and the king of israel sent to the place which the man of god told him and warned him of and saved himself there not once nor twice 611 therefore the heart of the king of syria was sore troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them will ye not shew me which of us is for the king of israel 612 and one of his servants said none my lord o king but elisha the prophet that is in israel telleth the king of israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber 613 and he said go and spy where he is that i may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he is in dothan 614 therefore sent he thither horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about 615 and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone forth behold an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do 616 and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them 617 and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about elisha 618 and when they came down to him elisha prayed unto the lord and said smite this people i pray thee with blindness and he smote them with blindness according to the word of elisha 619 and elisha said unto them this is not the way neither is this the city follow me and i will bring you to the man whom ye seek but he led them to samaria 620 and it came to pass when they were come into samaria that elisha said lord open the eyes of these men that they may see and the lord opened their eyes and they saw and behold they were in the midst of samaria 621 and the king of israel said unto elisha when he saw them my father shall i smite them shall i smite them 622 and he answered thou shalt not smite them wouldest thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow set bread and water before them that they may eat and drink and go to their master 623 and he prepared great provision for them and when they had eaten and drunk he sent them away and they went to their master so the bands of syria came no more into the land of israel 624 and it came to pass after this that benhadad king of syria gathered all his host and went up and besieged samaria 625 and there was a great famine in samaria and behold they besieged it until an asss head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver and the fourth part of a cab of doves dung for five pieces of silver 626 and as the king of israel was passing by upon the wall there cried a woman unto him saying help my lord o king 627 and he said if the lord do not help thee whence shall i help thee out of the barnfloor or out of the winepress 628 and the king said unto her what aileth thee and she answered this woman said unto me give thy son that we may eat him to day and we will eat my son to morrow 629 so we boiled my son and did eat him and i said unto her on the next day give thy son that we may eat him and she hath hid her son 630 and it came to pass when the king heard the words of the woman that he rent his clothes and he passed by upon the wall and the people looked and behold he had sackcloth within upon his flesh 631 then he said god do so and more also to me if the head of elisha the son of shaphat shall stand on him this day 632 but elisha sat in his house and the elders sat with him and the king sent a man from before him but ere the messenger came to him he said to the elders see ye how this son of a murderer hath sent to take away mine head look when the messenger cometh shut the door and hold him fast at the door is not the sound of his masters feet behind him 633 and while he yet talked with them behold the messenger came down unto him and he said behold this evil is of the lord what should i wait for the lord any longer 71 then elisha said hear ye the word of the lord thus saith the lord to morrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of samaria 72 then a lord on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god and said behold if the lord would make windows in heaven might this thing be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof 73 and there were four leprous men at the entering in of the gate and they said one to another why sit we here until we die 74 if we say we will enter into the city then the famine is in the city and we shall die there and if we sit still here we die also now therefore come and let us fall unto the host of the syrians if they save us alive we shall live and if they kill us we shall but die 75 and they rose up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the syrians and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of syria behold there was no man there 76 for the lord had made the host of the syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses even the noise of a great host and they said one to another lo the king of israel hath hired against us the kings of the hittites and the kings of the egyptians to come upon us 77 wherefore they arose and fled in the twilight and left their tents and their horses and their asses even the camp as it was and fled for their life 78 and when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp they went into one tent and did eat and drink and carried thence silver and gold and raiment and went and hid it and came again and entered into another tent and carried thence also and went and hid it 79 then they said one to another we do not well this day is a day of good tidings and we hold our peace if we tarry till the morning light some mischief will come upon us now therefore come that we may go and tell the kings household 710 so they came and called unto the porter of the city and they told them saying we came to the camp of the syrians and behold there was no man there neither voice of man but horses tied and asses tied and the tents as they were 711 and he called the porters and they told it to the kings house within 712 and the king arose in the night and said unto his servants i will now shew you what the syrians have done to us they know that we be hungry therefore are they gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field saying when they come out of the city we shall catch them alive and get into the city 713 and one of his servants answered and said let some take i pray thee five of the horses that remain which are left in the city behold they are as all the multitude of israel that are left in it behold i say they are even as all the multitude of the israelites that are consumed and let us send and see 714 they took therefore two chariot horses and the king sent after the host of the syrians saying go and see 715 and they went after them unto jordan and lo all the way was full of garments and vessels which the syrians had cast away in their haste and the messengers returned and told the king 716 and the people went out and spoiled the tents of the syrians so a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel according to the word of the lord 717 and the king appointed the lord on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate and the people trode upon him in the gate and he died as the man of god had said who spake when the king came down to him 718 and it came to pass as the man of god had spoken to the king saying two measures of barley for a shekel and a measure of fine flour for a shekel shall be to morrow about this time in the gate of samaria 719 and that lord answered the man of god and said now behold if the lord should make windows in heaven might such a thing be and he said behold thou shalt see it with thine eyes but shalt not eat thereof 720 and so it fell out unto him for the people trode upon him in the gate and he died 81 then spake elisha unto the woman whose son he had restored to life saying arise and go thou and thine household and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn for the lord hath called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land seven years 82 and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of god and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the philistines seven years 83 and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the philistines and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land 84 and the king talked with gehazi the servant of the man of god saying tell me i pray thee all the great things that elisha hath done 85 and it came to pass as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land and gehazi said my lord o king this is the woman and this is her son whom elisha restored to life 86 and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now 87 and elisha came to damascus and benhadad the king of syria was sick and it was told him saying the man of god is come hither 88 and the king said unto hazael take a present in thine hand and go meet the man of god and enquire of the lord by him saying shall i recover of this disease 89 so hazael went to meet him and took a present with him even of every good thing of damascus forty camels burden and came and stood before him and said thy son benhadad king of syria hath sent me to thee saying shall i recover of this disease 810 and elisha said unto him go say unto him thou mayest certainly recover howbeit the lord hath shewed me that he shall surely die 811 and he settled his countenance stedfastly until he was ashamed and the man of god wept 812 and hazael said why weepeth my lord and he answered because i know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of israel their strong holds wilt thou set on fire and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword and wilt dash their children and rip up their women with child 813 and hazael said but what is thy servant a dog that he should do this great thing and elisha answered the lord hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over syria 814 so he departed from elisha and came to his master who said to him what said elisha to thee and he answered he told me that thou shouldest surely recover 815 and it came to pass on the morrow that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he died and hazael reigned in his stead 816 and in the fifth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel jehoshaphat being then king of judah jehoram the son of je hoshaphat king of judah began to reign 817 thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem 818 and he walked in the way of the kings of israel as did the house of ahab for the daughter of ahab was his wife and he did evil in the sight of the lord 819 yet the lord would not destroy judah for david his servants sake as he promised him to give him alway a light and to his children 820 in his days edom revolted from under the hand of judah and made a king over themselves 821 so joram went over to zair and all the chariots with him and he rose by night and smote the edomites which compassed him about and the captains of the chariots and the people fled into their tents 822 yet edom revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day then libnah revolted at the same time 823 and the rest of the acts of joram and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 824 and joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and ahaziah his son reigned in his stead 825 in the twelfth year of joram the son of ahab king of israel did ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah begin to reign 826 two and twenty years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem and his mothers name was athaliah the daughter of omri king of israel 827 and he walked in the way of the house of ahab and did evil in the sight of the lord as did the house of ahab for he was the son in law of the house of ahab 828 and he went with joram the son of ahab to the war against hazael king of syria in ramothgilead and the syrians wounded joram 829 and king joram went back to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him at ramah when he fought against hazael king of syria and ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see joram the son of ahab in jezreel because he was sick 91 and elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets and said unto him gird up thy loins and take this box of oil in thine hand and go to ramothgilead 92 and when thou comest thither look out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and go in and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to an inner chamber 93 then take the box of oil and pour it on his head and say thus saith the lord i have anointed thee king over israel then open the door and flee and tarry not 94 so the young man even the young man the prophet went to ramothgilead 95 and when he came behold the captains of the host were sitting and he said i have an errand to thee o captain and jehu said unto which of all us and he said to thee o captain 96 and he arose and went into the house and he poured the oil on his head and said unto him thus saith the lord god of israel i have anointed thee king over the people of the lord even over israel 97 and thou shalt smite the house of ahab thy master that i may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the servants of the lord at the hand of jezebel 98 for the whole house of ahab shall perish and i will cut off from ahab him that pisseth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in israel 99 and i will make the house of ahab like the house of jeroboam the son of nebat and like the house of baasha the son of ahijah 910 and the dogs shall eat jezebel in the portion of jezreel and there shall be none to bury her and he opened the door and fled 911 then jehu came forth to the servants of his lord and one said unto him is all well wherefore came this mad fellow to thee and he said unto them ye know the man and his communication 912 and they said it is false tell us now and he said thus and thus spake he to me saying thus saith the lord i have anointed thee king over israel 913 then they hasted and took every man his garment and put it under him on the top of the stairs and blew with trumpets saying jehu is king 914 so jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspired against joram now joram had kept ramothgilead he and all israel because of hazael king of syria 915 but king joram was returned to be healed in jezreel of the wounds which the syrians had given him when he fought with hazael king of syria and jehu said if it be your minds then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in jezreel 916 so jehu rode in a chariot and went to jezreel for joram lay there and ahaziah king of judah was come down to see joram 917 and there stood a watchman on the tower in jezreel and he spied the company of jehu as he came and said i see a company and joram said take an horseman and send to meet them and let him say is it peace 918 so there went one on horseback to meet him and said thus saith the king is it peace and jehu said what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me and the watchman told saying the messenger came to them but he cometh not again 919 then he sent out a second on horseback which came to them and said thus saith the king is it peace and jehu answered what hast thou to do with peace turn thee behind me 920 and the watchman told saying he came even unto them and cometh not again and the driving is like the driving of jehu the son of nimshi for he driveth furiously 921 and joram said make ready and his chariot was made ready and joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah went out each in his chariot and they went out against jehu and met him in the portion of naboth the jezreelite 922 and it came to pass when joram saw jehu that he said is it peace jehu and he answered what peace so long as the whoredoms of thy mother jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many 923 and joram turned his hands and fled and said to ahaziah there is treachery o ahaziah 924 and jehu drew a bow with his full strength and smote jehoram between his arms and the arrow went out at his heart and he sunk down in his chariot 925 then said jehu to bidkar his captain take up and cast him in the portion of the field of naboth the jezreelite for remember how that when i and thou rode together after ahab his father the lord laid this burden upon him 926 surely i have seen yesterday the blood of naboth and the blood of his sons saith the lord and i will requite thee in this plat saith the lord now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground according to the word of the lord 927 but when ahaziah the king of judah saw this he fled by the way of the garden house and jehu followed after him and said smite him also in the chariot and they did so at the going up to gur which is by ibleam and he fled to megiddo and died there 928 and his servants carried him in a chariot to jerusalem and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of david 929 and in the eleventh year of joram the son of ahab began ahaziah to reign over judah 930 and when jehu was come to jezreel jezebel heard of it and she painted her face and tired her head and looked out at a window 931 and as jehu entered in at the gate she said had zimri peace who slew his master 932 and he lifted up his face to the window and said who is on my side who and there looked out to him two or three eunuchs 933 and he said throw her down so they threw her down and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses and he trode her under foot 934 and when he was come in he did eat and drink and said go see now this cursed woman and bury her for she is a kings daughter 935 and they went to bury her but they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands 936 wherefore they came again and told him and he said this is the word of the lord which he spake by his servant elijah the tishbite saying in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of jezebel 937 and the carcase of jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of jezreel so that they shall not say this is jezebel 101 and ahab had seventy sons in samaria and jehu wrote letters and sent to samaria unto the rulers of jezreel to the elders and to them that brought up ahabs children saying 102 now as soon as this letter cometh to you seeing your masters sons are with you and there are with you chariots and horses a fenced city also and armour 103 look even out the best and meetest of your masters sons and set him on his fathers throne and fight for your masters house 104 but they were exceedingly afraid and said behold two kings stood not before him how then shall we stand 105 and he that was over the house and he that was over the city the elders also and the bringers up of the children sent to jehu saying we are thy servants and will do all that thou shalt bid us we will not make any king do thou that which is good in thine eyes 106 then he wrote a letter the second time to them saying if ye be mine and if ye will hearken unto my voice take ye the heads of the men your masters sons and come to me to jezreel by to morrow this time now the kings sons being seventy persons were with the great men of the city which brought them up 107 and it came to pass when the letter came to them that they took the kings sons and slew seventy persons and put their heads in baskets and sent him them to jezreel 108 and there came a messenger and told him saying they have brought the heads of the kings sons and he said lay ye them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning 109 and it came to pass in the morning that he went out and stood and said to all the people ye be righteous behold i conspired against my master and slew him but who slew all these 1010 know now that there shall fall unto the earth nothing of the word of the lord which the lord spake concerning the house of ahab for the lord hath done that which he spake by his servant elijah 1011 so jehu slew all that remained of the house of ahab in jezreel and all his great men and his kinsfolks and his priests until he left him none remaining 1012 and he arose and departed and came to samaria and as he was at the shearing house in the way 1013 jehu met with the brethren of ahaziah king of judah and said who are ye and they answered we are the brethren of ahaziah and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen 1014 and he said take them alive and they took them alive and slew them at the pit of the shearing house even two and forty men neither left he any of them 1015 and when he was departed thence he lighted on jehonadab the son of rechab coming to meet him and he saluted him and said to him is thine heart right as my heart is with thy heart and jehonadab answered it is if it be give me thine hand and he gave him his hand and he took him up to him into the chariot 1016 and he said come with me and see my zeal for the lord so they made him ride in his chariot 1017 and when he came to samaria he slew all that remained unto ahab in samaria till he had destroyed him according to the saying of the lord which he spake to elijah 1018 and jehu gathered all the people together and said unto them ahab served baal a little but jehu shall serve him much 1019 now therefore call unto me all the prophets of baal all his servants and all his priests let none be wanting for i have a great sacrifice to do to baal whosoever shall be wanting he shall not live but jehu did it in subtilty to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of baal 1020 and jehu said proclaim a solemn assembly for baal and they proclaimed it 1021 and jehu sent through all israel and all the worshippers of baal came so that there was not a man left that came not and they came into the house of baal and the house of baal was full from one end to another 1022 and he said unto him that was over the vestry bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of baal and he brought them forth vestments 1023 and jehu went and jehonadab the son of rechab into the house of baal and said unto the worshippers of baal search and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the lord but the worshippers of baal only 1024 and when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings jehu appointed fourscore men without and said if any of the men whom i have brought into your hands escape he that letteth him go his life shall be for the life of him 1025 and it came to pass as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering that jehu said to the guard and to the captains go in and slay them let none come forth and they smote them with the edge of the sword and the guard and the captains cast them out and went to the city of the house of baal 1026 and they brought forth the images out of the house of baal and burned them 1027 and they brake down the image of baal and brake down the house of baal and made it a draught house unto this day 1028 thus jehu destroyed baal out of israel 1029 howbeit from the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin jehu departed not from after them to wit the golden calves that were in bethel and that were in dan 1030 and the lord said unto jehu because thou hast done well in executing that which is right in mine eyes and hast done unto the house of ahab according to all that was in mine heart thy children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of israel 1031 but jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the lord god of israel with all his heart for he departed not from the sins of jeroboam which made israel to sin 1032 in those days the lord began to cut israel short and hazael smote them in all the coasts of israel 1033 from jordan eastward all the land of gilead the gadites and the reubenites and the manassites from aroer which is by the river arnon even gilead and bashan 1034 now the rest of the acts of jehu and all that he did and all his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 1035 and jehu slept with his fathers and they buried him in samaria and jehoahaz his son reigned in his stead 1036 and the time that jehu reigned over israel in samaria was twenty and eight years 111 and when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal 112 but jehosheba the daughter of king joram sister of ahaziah took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the kings sons which were slain and they hid him even him and his nurse in the bedchamber from athaliah so that he was not slain 113 and he was with her hid in the house of the lord six years and athaliah did reign over the land 114 and the seventh year jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds with the captains and the guard and brought them to him into the house of the lord and made a covenant with them and took an oath of them in the house of the lord and shewed them the kings son 115 and he commanded them saying this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be keepers of the watch of the kings house 116 and a third part shall be at the gate of sur and a third part at the gate behind the guard so shall ye keep the watch of the house that it be not broken down 117 and two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath even they shall keep the watch of the house of the lord about the king 118 and ye shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and he that cometh within the ranges let him be slain and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in 119 and the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that jehoiada the priest commanded and they took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath with them that should go out on the sabbath and came to jehoiada the priest 1110 and to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king davids spears and shields that were in the temple of the lord 1111 and the guard stood every man with his weapons in his hand round about the king from the right corner of the temple to the left corner of the temple along by the altar and the temple 1112 and he brought forth the kings son and put the crown upon him and gave him the testimony and they made him king and anointed him and they clapped their hands and said god save the king 1113 and when athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the people she came to the people into the temple of the lord 1114 and when she looked behold the king stood by a pillar as the manner was and the princes and the trumpeters by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew with trumpets and athaliah rent her clothes and cried treason treason 1115 but jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds the officers of the host and said unto them have her forth without the ranges and him that followeth her kill with the sword for the priest had said let her not be slain in the house of the lord 1116 and they laid hands on her and she went by the way by the which the horses came into the kings house and there was she slain 1117 and jehoiada made a covenant between the lord and the king and the people that they should be the lords people between the king also and the people 1118 and all the people of the land went into the house of baal and brake it down his altars and his images brake they in pieces thoroughly and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars and the priest appointed officers over the house of the lord 1119 and he took the rulers over hundreds and the captains and the guard and all the people of the land and they brought down the king from the house of the lord and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the kings house and he sat on the throne of the kings 1120 and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was in quiet and they slew athaliah with the sword beside the kings house 1121 seven years old was jehoash when he began to reign 121 in the seventh year of jehu jehoash began to reign and forty years reigned he in jerusalem and his mothers name was zibiah of beersheba 122 and jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all his days wherein jehoiada the priest instructed him 123 but the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places 124 and jehoash said to the priests all the money of the dedicated things that is brought into the house of the lord even the money of every one that passeth the account the money that every man is set at and all the money that cometh into any mans heart to bring into the house of the lord 125 let the priests take it to them every man of his acquaintance and let them repair the breaches of the house wheresoever any breach shall be found 126 but it was so that in the three and twentieth year of king jehoash the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house 127 then king jehoash called for jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said unto them why repair ye not the breaches of the house now therefore receive no more money of your acquaintance but deliver it for the breaches of the house 128 and the priests consented to receive no more money of the people neither to repair the breaches of the house 129 but jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar on the right side as one cometh into the house of the lord and the priests that kept the door put therein all the money that was brought into the house of the lord 1210 and it was so when they saw that there was much money in the chest that the kings scribe and the high priest came up and they put up in bags and told the money that was found in the house of the lord 1211 and they gave the money being told into the hands of them that did the work that had the oversight of the house of the lord and they laid it out to the carpenters and builders that wrought upon the house of the lord 1212 and to masons and hewers of stone and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the lord and for all that was laid out for the house to repair it 1213 howbeit there were not made for the house of the lord bowls of silver snuffers basons trumpets any vessels of gold or vessels of silver of the money that was brought into the house of the lord 1214 but they gave that to the workmen and repaired therewith the house of the lord 1215 moreover they reckoned not with the men into whose hand they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen for they dealt faithfully 1216 the trespass money and sin money was not brought into the house of the lord it was the priests 1217 then hazael king of syria went up and fought against gath and took it and hazael set his face to go up to jerusalem 1218 and jehoash king of judah took all the hallowed things that jehoshaphat and jehoram and ahaziah his fathers kings of judah had dedicated and his own hallowed things and all the gold that was found in the treasures of the house of the lord and in the kings house and sent it to hazael king of syria and he went away from jerusalem 1219 and the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 1220 and his servants arose and made a conspiracy and slew joash in the house of millo which goeth down to silla 1221 for jozachar the son of shimeath and jehozabad the son of shomer his servants smote him and he died and they buried him with his fathers in the city of david and amaziah his son reigned in his stead 131 in the three and twentieth year of joash the son of ahaziah king of judah jehoahaz the son of jehu began to reign over israel in samaria and reigned seventeen years 132 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord and followed the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat which made israel to sin he departed not therefrom 133 and the anger of the lord was kindled against israel and he delivered them into the hand of hazael king of syria and into the hand of benhadad the son of hazael all their days 134 and jehoahaz besought the lord and the lord hearkened unto him for he saw the oppression of israel because the king of syria oppressed them 135 and the lord gave israel a saviour so that they went out from under the hand of the syrians and the children of israel dwelt in their tents as beforetime 136 nevertheless they departed not from the sins of the house of jeroboam who made israel sin but walked therein and there remained the grove also in samaria 137 neither did he leave of the people to jehoahaz but fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen for the king of syria had destroyed them and had made them like the dust by threshing 138 now the rest of the acts of jehoahaz and all that he did and his might are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 139 and jehoahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in samaria and joash his son reigned in his stead 1310 in the thirty and seventh year of joash king of judah began jehoash the son of jehoahaz to reign over israel in samaria and reigned sixteen years 1311 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel sin but he walked therein 1312 and the rest of the acts of joash and all that he did and his might wherewith he fought against amaziah king of judah are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 1313 and joash slept with his fathers and jeroboam sat upon his throne and joash was buried in samaria with the kings of israel 1314 now elisha was fallen sick of his sickness whereof he died and joash the king of israel came down unto him and wept over his face and said o my father my father the chariot of israel and the horsemen thereof 1315 and elisha said unto him take bow and arrows and he took unto him bow and arrows 1316 and he said to the king of israel put thine hand upon the bow and he put his hand upon it and elisha put his hands upon the kings hands 1317 and he said open the window eastward and he opened it then elisha said shoot and he shot and he said the arrow of the lords deliverance and the arrow of deliverance from syria for thou shalt smite the syrians in aphek till thou have consumed them 1318 and he said take the arrows and he took them and he said unto the king of israel smite upon the ground and he smote thrice and stayed 1319 and the man of god was wroth with him and said thou shouldest have smitten five or six times then hadst thou smitten syria till thou hadst consumed it whereas now thou shalt smite syria but thrice 1320 and elisha died and they buried him and the bands of the moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year 1321 and it came to pass as they were burying a man that behold they spied a band of men and they cast the man into the sepulchre of elisha and when the man was let down and touched the bones of elisha he revived and stood up on his feet 1322 but hazael king of syria oppressed israel all the days of jehoahaz 1323 and the lord was gracious unto them and had compassion on them and had respect unto them because of his covenant with abraham isaac and jacob and would not destroy them neither cast he them from his presence as yet 1324 so hazael king of syria died and benhadad his son reigned in his stead 1325 and jehoash the son of jehoahaz took again out of the hand of benhadad the son of hazael the cities which he had taken out of the hand of jehoahaz his father by war three times did joash beat him and recovered the cities of israel 141 in the second year of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel reigned amaziah the son of joash king of judah 142 he was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jehoaddan of jerusalem 143 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord yet not like david his father he did according to all things as joash his father did 144 howbeit the high places were not taken away as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places 145 and it came to pass as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father 146 but the children of the murderers he slew not according unto that which is written in the book of the law of moses wherein the lord commanded saying the fathers shall not be put to death for the children nor the children be put to death for the fathers but every man shall be put to death for his own sin 147 he slew of edom in the valley of salt ten thousand and took selah by war and called the name of it joktheel unto this day 148 then amaziah sent messengers to jehoash the son of jehoahaz son of jehu king of israel saying come let us look one another in the face 149 and jehoash the king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon saying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a wild beast that was in lebanon and trode down the thistle 1410 thou hast indeed smitten edom and thine heart hath lifted thee up glory of this and tarry at home for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with thee 1411 but amaziah would not hear therefore jehoash king of israel went up and he and amaziah king of judah looked one another in the face at bethshemesh which belongeth to judah 1412 and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled every man to their tents 1413 and jehoash king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son of jehoash the son of ahaziah at bethshemesh and came to jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim unto the corner gate four hundred cubits 1414 and he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the kings house and hostages and returned to samaria 1415 now the rest of the acts of jehoash which he did and his might and how he fought with amaziah king of judah are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 1416 and jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in samaria with the kings of israel and jeroboam his son reigned in his stead 1417 and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of jehoash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years 1418 and the rest of the acts of amaziah are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 1419 now they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to lachish but they sent after him to lachish and slew him there 1420 and they brought him on horses and he was buried at jerusalem with his fathers in the city of david 1421 and all the people of judah took azariah which was sixteen years old and made him king instead of his father amaziah 1422 he built elath and restored it to judah after that the king slept with his fathers 1423 in the fifteenth year of amaziah the son of joash king of judah jeroboam the son of joash king of israel began to reign in samaria and reigned forty and one years 1424 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord he departed not from all the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin 1425 he restored the coast of israel from the entering of hamath unto the sea of the plain according to the word of the lord god of israel which he spake by the hand of his servant jonah the son of amittai the prophet which was of gathhepher 1426 for the lord saw the affliction of israel that it was very bitter for there was not any shut up nor any left nor any helper for israel 1427 and the lord said not that he would blot out the name of israel from under heaven but he saved them by the hand of jeroboam the son of joash 1428 now the rest of the acts of jeroboam and all that he did and his might how he warred and how he recovered damascus and hamath which belonged to judah for israel are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of israel 1429 and jeroboam slept with his fathers even with the kings of israel and zachariah his son reigned in his stead 151 in the twenty and seventh year of jeroboam king of israel began azariah son of amaziah king of judah to reign 152 sixteen years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned two and fifty years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jecholiah of jerusalem 153 and he did

jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of uzziah king of judah and he reigned a full month in samaria 1514 for menahem the son of gadi went up from tirzah and came to samaria and smote shallum the son of jabesh in samaria and slew him and reigned in his stead 1515 and the rest of the acts of shallum and his conspiracy which he made behold they are written in the book of the

twenty years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jerusha the daughter of zadok 1534 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord he did according to all that his father uzziah had done 1535 howbeit the high places were not removed the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places he built the higher gate of the house of the lord 1536 now the rest of the acts of jotham and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 1537 in those days the lord began to send

his stead 161 in the seventeenth year of pekah the son of remaliah ahaz the son of jotham king of judah began to reign 162 twenty years old was ahaz when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem and did not that which was right in the sight of the lord his god like david his father 163 but he walked in the way of the kings of israel yea and made his son to pass through the fire according to the abominations of the heathen whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel 164 and he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree 165 then rezin king of syria and pekah son of remaliah king of israel came up to jerusalem to war and they besieged ahaz but could not overcome him 166 at that time rezin king of syria recovered elath to syria and drave the jews from elath and the syrians came to elath and dwelt there unto this day 167 so ahaz sent messengers to tiglathpileser king of assyria saying i am thy servant and thy son come up and save me out of the hand of the king of syria and out of the hand of the king of israel which rise up against me 168 and ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the kings house and sent it for a present to the king of assyria 169 and the king of assyria hearkened unto him for the king of assyria went up against damascus and took it and carried the people of it captive to kir and slew rezin 1610 and king ahaz went to damascus to meet tiglathpileser king of assyria and saw an altar that was at damascus and king ahaz sent to urijah the priest the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it according to all the workmanship thereof 1611 and urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king ahaz had sent from damascus so urijah the priest made it against king ahaz came from damascus 1612 and when the king was come from damascus the king saw the altar and the king approached to the altar and offered thereon 1613 and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering and poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings upon the altar 1614 and he brought also the brasen altar which was before the lord from the forefront of the house from between the altar and the house of the lord and put it on the north side of the altar 1615 and king ahaz commanded urijah the priest saying upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening meat offering and the kings burnt sacrifice and his meat offering with the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their meat offering and their drink offerings and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice and the brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by 1616 thus did urijah the priest according to all that king ahaz commanded 1617 and king ahaz cut off the borders of the bases and removed the laver from off them and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it and put it upon the pavement of stones 1618 and the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house and the kings entry without turned he from the house of the lord for the king of assyria 1619 now the rest of the acts of ahaz which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 1620 and ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead 171 in the twelfth year of ahaz king of judah began hoshea the son of elah to reign in samaria over israel nine years 172 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord but not as the kings of israel that were before him 173 against him came up shalmaneser king of assyria and hoshea became his servant and gave him presents 174 and the king of assyria found conspiracy in hoshea for he had sent messengers to so king of egypt and brought no present to the king of assyria as he had done year by year therefore the king of assyria shut him up and bound him in prison 175 then the king of assyria came up throughout all the land and went up to samaria and besieged it three years 176 in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria took samaria and carried israel away into assyria and placed them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes 177 for so it was that the children of israel had sinned against the lord their god which had brought them up out of the land of egypt from under the hand of pharaoh king of egypt and had feared other gods 178 and walked in the statutes of the heathen whom the lord cast out from before the children of israel and of the kings of israel which they had made 179 and the children of israel did secretly those things that were not right against the lord their god and they built them high places in all their cities from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city 1710 and they set them up images and groves in every high hill and under every green tree 1711 and there they burnt incense in all the high places as did the heathen whom the lord carried away before them and wrought wicked things to provoke the lord to anger 1712 for they served idols whereof the lord had said unto them ye shall not do this thing 1713 yet the lord testified against israel and against judah by all the prophets and by all the seers saying turn ye from your evil ways and keep my commandments and my statutes according to all the law which i commanded your fathers and which i sent to you by my servants the prophets 1714 notwithstanding they would not hear but hardened their necks like to the neck of their fathers that did not believe in the lord their god 1715 and they rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers and his testimonies which he testified against them and they followed vanity and became vain and went after the heathen that were round about them concerning whom the lord had charged them that they should not do like them 1716 and they left all the commandments of the lord their god and made them molten images even two calves and made a grove and worshipped all the host of heaven and served baal 1717 and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire and used divination and enchantments and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger 1718 therefore the lord was very angry with israel and removed them out of his sight there was none left but the tribe of judah only 1719 also judah kept not the commandments of the lord their god but walked in the statutes of israel which they made 1720 and the lord rejected all the seed of israel and afflicted them and delivered them into the hand of spoilers until he had cast them out of his sight 1721 for he rent israel from the house of david and they made jeroboam the son of nebat king and jeroboam drave israel from following the lord and made them sin a great sin 1722 for the children of israel walked in all the sins of jeroboam which he did they departed not from them 1723 until the lord removed israel out of his sight as he had said by all his servants the prophets so was israel carried away out of their own land to assyria unto this day 1724 and the king of assyria brought men from babylon and from cuthah and from ava and from hamath and from sepharvaim and placed them in the cities of samaria instead of the children of israel and they possessed samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof 1725 and so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there that they feared not the lord therefore the lord sent lions among them which slew some of them 1726 wherefore they spake to the king of assyria saying the nations which thou hast removed and placed in the cities of samaria know not the manner of the god of the land therefore he hath sent lions among them and behold they slay them because they know not the manner of the god of the land 1727 then the king of assyria commanded saying carry thither one of the priests whom ye brought from thence and let them go and dwell there and let him teach them the manner of the god of the land 1728 then one of the priests whom they had carried away from samaria came and dwelt in bethel and taught them how they should fear the lord 1729 howbeit every nation made gods of their own and put them in the houses of the high places which the samaritans had made every nation in their cities wherein they dwelt 1730 and the men of babylon made succothbenoth and the men of cuth made nergal and the men of hamath made ashima 1731 and the avites made nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvites burnt their children in fire to adrammelech and anammelech the gods of sepharvaim 1732 so they feared the lord and made unto themselves of the lowest of them priests of the high places which sacrificed for them in the houses of the high places 1733 they feared the lord and served their own gods after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from thence 1734 unto this day they do after the former manners they fear not the lord neither do they after their statutes or after their ordinances or after the law and commandment which the lord commanded the children of jacob whom he named israel 1735 with whom the lord had made a covenant and charged them saying ye shall not fear other gods nor bow yourselves to them nor serve them nor sacrifice to them 1736 but the lord who brought you up out of the land of egypt with great power and a stretched out arm him shall ye fear and him shall ye worship and to him shall ye do sacrifice 1737 and the statutes and the ordinances and the law and the commandment which he wrote for you ye shall observe to do for evermore and ye shall not fear other gods 1738 and the covenant that i have made with you ye shall not forget neither shall ye fear other gods 1739 but the lord your god ye shall fear and he shall deliver you out of the hand of all your enemies 1740 howbeit they did not hearken but they did after their former manner 1741 so these nations feared the lord and served their graven images both their children and their childrens children as did their fathers so do they unto this day 181 now it came to pass in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that hezekiah the son of ahaz king of judah began to reign 182 twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem his mothers name also was abi the daughter of zachariah 183 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that david his father did 184 he removed the high places and brake the images and cut down the groves and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that moses had made for unto those days the children of israel did burn incense to it and he called it nehushtan 185 he trusted in the lord god of israel so that after him was none like him among all the kings of judah nor any that were before him 186 for he clave to the lord and departed not from following him but kept his commandments which the lord commanded moses 187 and the lord was with him and he prospered whithersoever he went forth and he rebelled against the king of assyria and served him not 188 he smote the philistines even unto gaza and the borders thereof from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city 189 and it came to pass in the fourth year of king hezekiah which was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel that shalmaneser king of assyria came up against samaria and besieged it 1810 and at the end of three years they took it even in the sixth year of hezekiah that is in the ninth year of hoshea king of israel samaria was taken 1811 and the king of assyria did carry away israel unto assyria and put them in halah and in habor by the river of gozan and in the cities of the medes 1812 because they obeyed not the voice of the lord their god but transgressed his covenant and all that moses the servant of the lord commanded and would not hear them nor do them 1813 now in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah did sennacherib king of assyria come up against all the fenced cities of judah and took them 1814 and hezekiah king of judah sent to the king of assyria to lachish saying i have offended return from me that which thou puttest on me will i bear and the king of assyria appointed unto hezekiah king of judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold 1815 and hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the lord and in the treasures of the kings house 1816 at that time did hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the lord and from the pillars which hezekiah king of judah had overlaid and gave it to the king of assyria 1817 and the king of assyria sent tartan and rabsaris and rabshakeh from lachish to king hezekiah with a great host against jerusalem and they went up and came to jerusalem and when they were come up they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool which is in the highway of the fullers field 1818 and when they had called to the king there came out to them eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder 1819 and rabshakeh said unto them speak ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest 1820 thou sayest but they are but vain words i have counsel and strength for the war now on whom dost thou trust that thou rebellest against me 1821 now behold thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed even upon egypt on which if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt unto all that trust on him 1822 but if ye say unto me we trust in the lord our god is not that he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and hath said to judah and jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar in jerusalem 1823 now therefore i pray thee give pledges to my lord the king of assyria and i will deliver thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them 1824 how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my masters servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen 1825 am i now come up without the lord against this place to destroy it the lord said to me go up against this land and destroy it 1826 then said eliakim the son of hilkiah and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i pray thee to thy servants in the syrian language for we understand it and talk not with us in the jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall 1827 but rabshakeh said unto them hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men which sit on the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you 1828 then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and spake saying hear the word of the great king the king of assyria 1829 thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you out of his hand 1830 neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria 1831 hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and then eat ye every man of his own vine and every one of his fig tree and drink ye every one the waters of his cistern 1832 until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of oil olive and of honey that ye may live and not die and hearken not unto hezekiah when he persuadeth you saying the lord will deliver us 1833 hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land out of the hand of the king of assyria 1834 where are the gods of hamath and of arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim hena and ivah have they delivered samaria out of mine hand 1835 who are they among all the gods of the countries that have delivered their country out of mine hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of mine hand 1836 but the people held their peace and answered him not a word for the kings commandment was saying answer him not 1837 then came eliakim the son of hilkiah which was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of rabshakeh 191 and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord 192 and he sent eliakim which was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth to isaiah the prophet the son of amoz 193 and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth 194 it may be the lord thy god will hear all the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that are left 195 so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah 196 and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say to your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words which thou hast heard with which the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me 197 behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and shall return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land 198 so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish 199 and when he heard say of tirhakah king of ethiopia behold he is come out to fight against thee he sent messengers again unto hezekiah saying 1910 thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria 1911 behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered 1912 have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden which were in thelasar 1913 where is the king of hamath and the king of arpad and the king of the city of sepharvaim of hena and ivah 1914 and hezekiah received the letter of the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up into the house of the lord and spread it before the lord 1915 and hezekiah prayed before the lord and said o lord god of israel which dwellest between the cherubims thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth 1916 lord bow down thine ear and hear open lord thine eyes and see and hear the words of sennacherib which hath sent him to reproach the living god 1917 of a truth lord the kings of assyria have destroyed the nations and their lands 1918 and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them 1919 now therefore o lord our god i beseech thee save thou us out of his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord god even thou only 1920 then isaiah the son of amoz sent to hezekiah saying thus saith the lord god of israel that which thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria i have heard 1921 this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning him the virgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee 1922 whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against the holy one of israel 1923 by thy messengers thou hast reproached the lord and hast said with the multitude of my chariots i am come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of lebanon and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter into the lodgings of his borders and into the forest of his carmel 1924 i have digged and drunk strange waters and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of besieged places 1925 hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient times that i have formed it now have i brought it to pass that thou shouldest be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps 1926 therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the house tops and as corn blasted before it be grown up 1927 but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against me 1928 because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears therefore i will put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest 1929 and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves and in the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruits thereof 1930 and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall yet again take root downward and bear fruit upward 1931 for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this 1932 therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shield nor cast a bank against it 1933 by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the lord 1934 for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake 1935 and it came to pass that night that the angel of the lord went out and smote in the camp of the assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses 1936 so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh 1937 and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of armenia and esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead 201 in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz came to him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live 202 then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the lord saying 203 i beseech thee o lord remember now how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore 204 and it came to pass afore isaiah was gone out into the middle court that the word of the lord came to him saying 205 turn again and tell hezekiah the captain of my people thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the lord 206 and i will add unto thy days fifteen years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake 207 and isaiah said take a lump of figs and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered 208 and hezekiah said unto isaiah what shall be the sign that the lord will heal me and that i shall go up into the house of the lord the third day 209 and isaiah said this sign shalt thou have of the lord that the lord will do the thing that he hath spoken shall the shadow go forward ten degrees or go back ten degrees 2010 and hezekiah answered it is a light thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees nay but let the shadow return backward ten degrees 2011 and isaiah the prophet cried unto the lord and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward by which it had gone down in the dial of ahaz 2012 at that time berodachbaladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present unto hezekiah for he had heard that hezekiah had been sick 2013 and hezekiah hearkened unto them and shewed them all the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah shewed them not 2014 then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and hezekiah said they are come from a far country even from babylon 2015 and he said what have they seen in thine house and hezekiah answered all the things that are in mine house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them 2016 and isaiah said unto hezekiah hear the word of the lord 2017 behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be carried into babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord 2018 and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon 2019 then said hezekiah unto isaiah good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken and he said is it not good if peace and truth be in my days 2020 and the rest of the acts of hezekiah and all his might and how he made a pool and a conduit and brought water into the city are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 2021 and hezekiah slept with his fathers and manasseh his son reigned in his stead 211 manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem and his mothers name was hephzibah 212 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord after the abominations of the heathen whom the lord cast out before the children of israel 213 for he built up again the high places which hezekiah his father had destroyed and he reared up altars for baal and made a grove as did ahab king of israel and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them 214 and he built altars in the house of the lord of which the lord said in jerusalem will i put my name 215 and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord 216 and he made his son pass through the fire and observed times and used enchantments and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger 217 and he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house of which the lord said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all tribes of israel will i put my name for ever 218 neither will i make the feet of israel move any more out of the land which i gave their fathers only if they will observe to do according to all that i have commanded them and according to all the law that my servant moses commanded them 219 but they hearkened not and manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the lord destroyed before the children of israel 2110 and the lord spake by his servants the prophets saying 2111 because manasseh king of judah hath done these abominations and hath done wickedly above all that the amorites did which were before him and hath made judah also to sin with his idols 2112 therefore thus saith the lord god of israel behold i am bringing such evil upon jerusalem and judah that whosoever heareth of it both his ears shall tingle 2113 and i will stretch over jerusalem the line of samaria and the plummet of the house of ahab and i will wipe jerusalem as a man wipeth a dish wiping it and turning it upside down 2114 and i will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies 2115 because they have done that which was evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger since the day their fathers came forth out of egypt even unto this day 2116 moreover manasseh shed innocent blood very much till he had filled jerusalem from one end to another beside his sin wherewith he made judah to sin in doing that which was evil in the sight of the lord 2117 now the rest of the acts of manasseh and all that he did and his sin that he sinned are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 2118 and manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house in the garden of uzza and amon his son reigned in his stead 2119 amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned two years in jerusalem and his mothers name was meshullemeth the daughter of haruz of jotbah 2120 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as his father manasseh did 2121 and he walked in all the way that his father walked in and served the idols that his father served and worshipped them 2122 and he forsook the lord god of his fathers and walked not in the way of the lord 2123 and the servants of amon conspired against him and slew the king in his own house 2124 and the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead 2125 now the rest of the acts of amon which he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 2126 and he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of uzza and josiah his son reigned in his stead 221 josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned thirty and one years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jedidah the daughter of adaiah of boscath 222 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord and walked in all the way of david his father and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left 223 and it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king josiah that the king sent shaphan the son of azaliah the son of meshullam the scribe to the house of the lord saying 224 go up to hilkiah the high priest that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the lord which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people 225 and let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work that have the oversight of the house of the lord and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the lord to repair the breaches of the house 226 unto carpenters and builders and masons and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house 227 howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand because they dealt faithfully 228 and hilkiah the high priest said unto shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah gave the book to shaphan and he read it 229 and shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought the king word again and said thy servants have gathered the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work that have the oversight of the house of the lord 2210 and shaphan the scribe shewed the king saying hilkiah the priest hath delivered me a book and shaphan read it before the king 2211 and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the book of the law that he rent his clothes 2212 and the king commanded hilkiah the priest and ahikam the son of shaphan and achbor the son of michaiah and shaphan the scribe and asahiah a servant of the kings saying 2213 go ye enquire of the lord for me and for the people and for all judah concerning the words of this book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord that is kindled against us because our fathers have not hearkened unto the words of this book to do according unto all that which is written concerning us 2214 so hilkiah the priest and ahikam and achbor and shaphan and asahiah went unto huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvah the son of harhas keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem in the college and they communed with her 2215 and she said unto them thus saith the lord god of israel tell the man that sent you to me 2216 thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the words of the book which the king of judah hath read 2217 because they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place and shall not be quenched 2218 but to the king of judah which sent you to enquire of the lord thus shall ye say to him thus saith the lord god of israel as touching the words which thou hast heard 2219 because thine heart was tender and thou hast humbled thyself before the lord when thou heardest what i spake against this place and against the inhabitants thereof that they should become a desolation and a curse and hast rent thy clothes and wept before me i also have heard thee saith the lord 2220 behold therefore i will gather thee unto thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which i will bring upon this place and they brought the king word again 231 and the king sent and they gathered unto him all the elders of judah and of jerusalem 232 and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the men of judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with him and the priests and the prophets and all the people both small and great and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the lord 233 and the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the lord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book and all the people stood to the covenant 234 and the king commanded hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the door to bring forth out of the temple of the lord all the vessels that were made for baal and for the grove and for all the host of heaven and he burned them without jerusalem in the fields of kidron and carried the ashes of them unto bethel 235 and he put down the idolatrous priests whom the kings of judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of judah and in the places round about jerusalem them also that burned incense unto baal to the sun and to the moon and to the planets and to all the host of heaven 236 and he brought out the grove from the house of the lord without jerusalem unto the brook kidron and burned it at the brook kidron and stamped it small to powder and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people 237 and he brake down the houses of the sodomites that were by the house of the lord where the women wove hangings for the grove 238 and he brought all the priests out of the cities of judah and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense from geba to beersheba and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of joshua the governor of the city which were on a mans left hand at the gate of the city 239 nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the lord in jerusalem but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren 2310 and he defiled topheth which is in the valley of the children of hinnom that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to molech 2311 and he took away the horses that the kings of judah had given to the sun at the entering in of the house of the lord by the chamber of nathanmelech the chamberlain which was in the suburbs and burned the chariots of the sun with fire 2312 and the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of ahaz which the kings of judah had made and the altars which manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the lord did the king beat down and brake them down from thence and cast the dust of them into the brook kidron 2313 and the high places that were before jerusalem which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption which solomon the king of israel had builded for ashtoreth the abomination of the zidonians and for chemosh the abomination of the moabites and for milcom the abomination of the children of ammon did the king defile 2314 and he brake in pieces the images and cut down the groves and filled their places with the bones of men 2315 moreover the altar that was at bethel and the high place which jeroboam the son of nebat who made israel to sin had made both that altar and the high place he brake down and burned the high place and stamped it small to powder and burned the grove 2316 and as josiah turned himself he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount and sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres and burned them upon the altar and polluted it according to the word of the lord which the man of god proclaimed who proclaimed these words 2317 then he said what title is that that i see and the men of the city told him it is the sepulchre of the man of god which came from judah and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of bethel 2318 and he said let him alone let no man move his bones so they let his bones alone with the bones of the prophet that came out of samaria 2319 and all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of samaria which the kings of israel had made to provoke the lord to anger josiah took away and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in bethel 2320 and he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars and burned mens bones upon them and returned to jerusalem 2321 and the king commanded all the people saying keep the passover unto the lord your god as it is written in the book of this covenant 2322 surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged israel nor in all the days of the kings of israel nor of the kings of judah 2323 but in the eighteenth year of king josiah wherein this passover was holden to the lord in jerusalem 2324 moreover the workers with familiar spirits and the wizards and the images and the idols and all the abominations that were spied in the land of judah and in jerusalem did josiah put away that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that hilkiah the priest found in the house of the lord 2325 and like unto him was there no king before him that turned to the lord with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his might according to all the law of moses neither after him arose there any like him 2326 notwithstanding the lord turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath wherewith his anger was kindled against judah because of all the provocations that manasseh had provoked him withal 2327 and the lord said i will remove judah also out of my sight as i have removed israel and will cast off this city jerusalem which i have chosen and the house of which i said my name shall be there 2328 now the rest of the acts of josiah and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 2329 in his days pharaohnechoh king of egypt went up against the king of assyria to the river euphrates and king josiah went against him and he slew him at megiddo when he had seen him 2330 and his servants carried him in a chariot dead from megiddo and brought him to jerusalem and buried him in his own sepulchre and the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and anointed him and made him king in his fathers stead 2331 jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem and his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah 2332 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that his fathers had done 2333 and pharaohnechoh put him in bands at riblah in the land of hamath that he might not reign in jerusalem and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold 2334 and pharaohnechoh made eliakim the son of josiah king in the room of josiah his father and turned his name to jehoiakim and took jehoahaz away and he came to egypt and died there 2335 and jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to pharaoh but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of pharaoh he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land of every one according to his taxation to give it unto pharaohnechoh 2336 jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was zebudah the daughter of pedaiah of rumah 2337 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that his fathers had done 241 in his days nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up and jehoiakim became his servant three years then he turned and rebelled against him 242 and the lord sent against him bands of the chaldees and bands of the syrians and bands of the moabites and bands of the children of ammon and sent them against judah to destroy it according to the word of the lord which he spake by his servants the prophets 243 surely at the commandment of the lord came this upon judah to remove them out of his sight for the sins of manasseh according to all that he did 244 and also for the innocent blood that he shed for he filled jerusalem with innocent blood which the lord would not pardon 245 now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and all that he did are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of judah 246 so jehoiakim slept with his fathers and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead 247 and the king of egypt came not again any more out of his land for the king of babylon had taken from the river of egypt unto the river euphrates all that pertained to the king of egypt 248 jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem three months and his mothers name was nehushta the daughter of elnathan of jerusalem 249 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that his father had done 2410 at that time the servants of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came up against jerusalem and the city was besieged 2411 and nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came against the city and his servants did besiege it 2412 and jehoiachin the king of judah went out to the king of babylon he and his mother and his servants and his princes and his officers and the king of babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign 2413 and he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings house and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which solomon king of israel had made in the temple of the lord as the lord had said 2414 and he carried away all jerusalem and all the princes and all the mighty men of valour even ten thousand captives and all the craftsmen and smiths none remained save the poorest sort of the people of the land 2415 and he carried away jehoiachin to babylon and the kings mother and the kings wives and his officers and the mighty of the land those carried he into captivity from jerusalem to babylon 2416 and all the men of might even seven thousand and craftsmen and smiths a thousand all that were strong and apt for war even them the king of babylon brought captive to babylon 2417 and the king of babylon made mattaniah his fathers brother king in his stead and changed his name to zedekiah 2418 zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah 2419 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord according to all that jehoiakim had done 2420 for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem and judah until he had cast them out from his presence that zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon 251 and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came he and all his host against jerusalem and pitched against it and they built forts against it round about 252 and the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah 253 and on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed in the city and there was no bread for the people of the land 254 and the city was broken up and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls which is by the kings garden now the chaldees were against the city round about and the king went the way toward the plain 255 and the army of the chaldees pursued after the king and overtook him in the plains of jericho and all his army were scattered from him 256 so they took the king and brought him up to the king of babylon to riblah and they gave judgment upon him 257 and they slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes and put out the eyes of zedekiah and bound him with fetters of brass and carried him to babylon 258 and in the fifth month on the seventh day of the month which is the nineteenth year of king nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came nebuzaradan captain of the guard a servant of the king of babylon unto jerusalem 259 and he burnt the house of the lord and the kings house and all the houses of jerusalem and every great mans house burnt he with fire 2510 and all the army of the chaldees that were with the captain of the guard brake down the walls of jerusalem round about 2511 now the rest of the people that were left in the city and the fugitives that fell away to the king of babylon with the remnant of the multitude did nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carry away 2512 but the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen 2513 and the pillars of brass that were in the house of the lord and the bases and the brasen sea that was in the house of the lord did the chaldees break in pieces and carried the brass of them to babylon 2514 and the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the spoons and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered took they away 2515 and the firepans and the bowls and such things as were of gold in gold and of silver in silver the captain of the guard took away 2516 the two pillars one sea and the bases which solomon had made for the house of the lord the brass of all these vessels was without weight 2517 the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits and the chapiter upon it was brass and the height of the chapiter three cubits and the wreathen work and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about all of brass and like unto these had the second pillar with wreathen work 2518 and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest and zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door 2519 and out of the city he took an officer that was set over the men of war and five men of them that were in the kings presence which were found in the city and the principal scribe of the host which mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the city 2520 and nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah 2521 and the king of babylon smote them and slew them at riblah in the land of hamath so judah was carried away out of their land 2522 and as for the people that remained in the land of judah whom nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had left even over them he made gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan ruler 2523 and when all the captains of the armies they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah governor there came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan the son of careah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth the netophathite and jaazaniah the son of a maachathite they and their men 2524 and gedaliah sware to them and to their men and said unto them fear not to be the servants of the chaldees dwell in the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you 2525 but it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal came and ten men with him and smote gedaliah that he died and the jews and the chaldees that were with him at mizpah 2526 and all the people both small and great and the captains of the armies arose and came to egypt for they were afraid of the chaldees 2527 and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of jehoiachin king of judah in the twelfth month on the seven and twentieth day of the month that evilmerodach king of babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up the head of jehoiachin king of judah out of prison 2528 and he spake kindly to him and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in babylon 2529 and changed his

his son azel his son 944 and azel had six sons whose names are these azrikam bocheru and ishmael and sheariah and obadiah and hanan these were the sons of azel 101 now the philistines fought against israel and the men of israel fled from before the philistines and fell down slain in mount gilboa 102 and the philistines followed hard after saul and after his sons and the philistines slew jonathan and abinadab and malchishua the sons of saul 103 and the battle went sore against saul and the archers hit him and he was wounded of the archers 104 then said saul to his armourbearer draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me but his armourbearer would not for he was sore afraid so saul took a sword and fell upon it 105 and when his armourbearer saw that saul was dead he fell likewise on the sword and died 106 so saul died and his three sons and all his house died together 107 and when all the men of israel that were in the valley saw that they fled and that saul and his sons were dead then they forsook their cities and fled and the philistines came and dwelt in them 108 and it came to pass on the morrow when the philistines came to strip the slain that they found saul and his sons fallen in mount gilboa 109 and when they had stripped him they took his head and his armour and sent into the land of the philistines round about to carry tidings unto their idols and to the people 1010 and they put his armour in the house of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of dagon 1011 and when all jabeshgilead heard all that the philistines had done to saul 1012 they arose all the valiant men and took away the body of saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to jabesh and buried their bones under the oak in jabesh and fasted seven days 1013 so saul died for his transgression which he committed against the lord even against the word of the lord which he kept not and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit to enquire of it 1014 and enquired not of the lord therefore he slew him and turned the kingdom unto david the son of jesse 111 then all israel gathered themselves to david unto hebron saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh 112 and moreover in time past even when saul was king thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in israel and the lord thy god said unto thee thou shalt feed my people israel and thou shalt be ruler over my people israel 113 therefore came all the elders of israel to the king to hebron and david made a covenant with them in hebron before the lord and they anointed david king over israel according to the word of the lord by samuel 114 and david and all israel went to jerusalem which is jebus where the jebusites were the inhabitants of the land 115 and the inhabitants of jebus said to david thou shalt not come hither nevertheless david took the castle of zion which is the city of david 116 and david said whosoever smiteth the jebusites first shall be chief and captain so joab the son of zeruiah went first up and was chief 117 and david dwelt in the castle therefore they called it the city of david 118 and he built the city round about even from millo round about and joab repaired the rest of the city 119 so david waxed greater and greater for the lord of hosts was with him 1110 these also are the chief of the mighty men whom david had who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom and with all israel to make him king according to the word of the lord concerning israel 1111 and this is the number of the mighty men whom david had jashobeam an hachmonite the chief of the captains he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time 1112 and after him was eleazar the son of dodo the ahohite who was one of the three mighties 1113 he was with david at pasdammim and there the philistines were gathered together to battle where was a parcel of ground full of barley and the people fled from before the philistines 1114 and they set themselves in the midst of that parcel and delivered it and slew the philistines and the lord saved them by a great deliverance 1115 now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to david into the cave of adullam and the host of the philistines encamped in the valley of rephaim 1116 and david was then in the hold and the philistines garrison was then at bethlehem 1117 and david longed and said oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of bethlehem that is at the gate 1118 and the three brake through the host of the philistines and drew water out of the well of bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to david but david would not drink of it but poured it out to the lord 1119 and said my god forbid it me that i should do this thing shall i drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it therefore he would not drink it these things did these three mightiest 1120 and abishai the brother of joab he was chief of the three for lifting up his spear against three hundred he slew them and had a name among the three 1121 of the three he was more honourable than the two for he was their captain howbeit he attained not to the first three 1122 benaiah the son of jehoiada the son of a valiant man of kabzeel who had done many acts he slew two lionlike men of moab also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day 1123 and he slew an egyptian a man of great stature five cubits high and in the egyptians hand was a spear like a weavers beam and he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the egyptians hand and slew him with his own spear 1124 these things did benaiah the son of jehoiada and had the name among the three mighties 1125 behold he was honourable among the thirty but attained not to the first three and david set him over his guard 1126 also the valiant men of the armies were asahel the brother of joab elhanan the son of dodo of bethlehem 1127 shammoth the harorite helez the pelonite 1128 ira the son of ikkesh the tekoite abiezer the antothite 1129 sibbecai the hushathite ilai the ahohite 1130

the fifth 1211 attai the sixth eliel the seventh 1212 johanan the eighth elzabad the ninth 1213 jeremiah the tenth machbanai the eleventh 1214 these were of the sons of gad captains of the host one of the least was over an hundred and the greatest over a thousand 1215 these are they that went over jordan in the first month when it had overflown all his banks and they put to flight all them of the valleys both toward the east and toward the west 1216 and there came of the children of benjamin and judah to the hold unto david 1217 and david went out to meet them and answered and said unto them if ye be come peaceably unto me to help me mine heart shall be knit unto you but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies seeing there is no wrong in mine hands the god of our fathers look thereon and rebuke it 1218 then the spirit came upon amasai who was chief of the captains and he said thine are we david and on thy side thou son of jesse peace peace be unto thee and peace be to thine helpers for thy god helpeth thee then david received them and made them captains of the band 1219 and there fell some of manasseh to david when he came with the philistines against saul to battle but they helped them not for the lords of the philistines upon advisement sent him away saying he will fall to his master saul to the jeopardy of our heads 1220 as he went to ziklag there fell to him of manasseh adnah and jozabad and jediael and michael and jozabad and elihu and zilthai captains of the thousands that were of manasseh 1221 and they helped david against the band of the rovers for they were all mighty men of valour and were captains in the host 1222 for at that time day by day there came to david to help him until it was a great host like the host of god 1223 and these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war and came to david to hebron to turn the kingdom of saul to him according to the word of the lord 1224 the children of judah that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred ready armed to the war 1225 of the children of simeon mighty men of valour for the war seven thousand and one hundred 1226 of the children of levi four thousand and six hundred 1227 and jehoiada was the leader of the aaronites and with him were three thousand and seven hundred 1228 and zadok a young man mighty of valour and of his fathers house twenty and two captains 1229 and of the children of benjamin the kindred of saul three thousand for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of saul 1230 and of the children of ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred mighty men of valour famous throughout the house of their fathers 1231 and of the half tribe of manasseh eighteen thousand which were expressed by name to come and make david king 1232 and of the children of issachar which were men that had understanding of the times to know what israel ought to do the heads of them were two hundred and all their brethren were at their commandment 1233 of zebulun such as went forth to battle expert in war with all instruments of war fifty thousand which could keep rank they were not of double heart 1234 and of naphtali a thousand captains and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand 1235 and of the danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred 1236 and of asher such as went forth to battle expert in war forty thousand 1237 and on the other side of jordan of the reubenites and the gadites and of the half tribe of manasseh with all manner of instruments of war for the battle an hundred and twenty thousand 1238 all these men of war that could keep rank came with a perfect heart to hebron to make david king over all israel and all the rest also of israel were of one heart to make david king 1239 and there they were with david three days eating and drinking for their brethren had prepared for them 1240 moreover they that were nigh them even unto issachar and zebulun and naphtali brought bread on asses and on camels and on mules and on oxen and meat meal cakes of figs and bunches of raisins and wine and oil and oxen and sheep abundantly for there was joy in israel 131 and david consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader 132 and david said unto all the congregation of israel if it seem good unto you and that it be of the lord our god let us send abroad unto our brethren every where that are left in all the land of israel and with them also to the priests and levites which are in their cities and suburbs that they may gather themselves unto us 133 and let us bring again the ark of our god to us for we enquired not at it in the days of saul 134 and all the congregation said that they would do so for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people 135 so david gathered all israel together from shihor of egypt even unto the entering of hemath to bring the ark of god from kirjathjearim 136 and david went up and all israel to baalah that is to kirjathjearim which belonged to judah to bring up thence the ark of god the lord that dwelleth between the cherubims whose name is called on it 137 and they carried the ark of god in a new cart out of the house of abinadab and uzza and ahio drave the cart 138 and david and all israel played before god with all their might and with singing and with harps and with psalteries and with timbrels and with cymbals and with trumpets 139 and when they came unto the threshingfloor of chidon uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark for the oxen stumbled 1310 and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzza and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before god 1311 and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon uzza wherefore that place is called perezuzza to this day 1312 and david was afraid of god that day saying how shall i bring the ark of god home to me 1313 so david brought not the ark home to himself to the city of david but carried it aside into the house of obededom the gittite 1314 and the ark of god remained with the family of obededom in his house three months and the lord blessed the house of obededom and all that he had 141 now hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david and timber of cedars with masons and carpenters to build him an house 142 and david perceived that the lord had confirmed him king over israel for his kingdom was lifted up on high because of his people israel 143 and david took more wives at jerusalem and david begat more sons and daughters 144 now these are the names of his children which he had in jerusalem shammua and shobab nathan and solomon 145 and ibhar and elishua and elpalet 146 and nogah and nepheg and japhia 147 and elishama and beeliada and eliphalet 148 and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king over all israel all the philistines went up to seek david and david heard of it and went out against them 149 and the philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of rephaim 1410 and david enquired of god saying shall i go up against the philistines and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand and the lord said unto him go up for i will deliver them into thine hand 1411 so they came up to baalperazim and david smote them there then david said god hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters therefore they called the name of that place baalperazim 1412 and when they had left their gods there david gave a commandment and they were burned with fire 1413 and the philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley 1414 therefore david enquired again of god and god said unto him go not up after them turn away from them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees 1415 and it shall be when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt go out to battle for god is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the philistines 1416 david therefore did as god commanded him and they smote the host of the philistines from gibeon even to gazer 1417 and the fame of david went out into all lands and the lord brought the fear of him upon all nations 151 and david made him houses in the city of david and prepared a place for the ark of god and pitched for it a tent 152 then david said none ought to carry the ark of god but the levites for them hath the lord chosen to carry the ark of god and to minister unto him for ever 153 and david gathered all israel together to jerusalem to bring up the ark of the lord unto his place which he had prepared for it 154 and david assembled the children of aaron and the levites 155 of the sons of kohath uriel the chief and his brethren an hundred and twenty 156 of the sons of merari asaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred and twenty 157 of the sons of gershom joel the chief and his brethren an hundred and thirty 158 of the sons of elizaphan shemaiah the chief and his brethren two hundred 159 of the sons of hebron eliel the chief and his brethren fourscore 1510 of the sons of uzziel amminadab the chief and his brethren an hundred and twelve 1511 and david called for zadok and abiathar the priests and for the levites for uriel asaiah and joel shemaiah and eliel and amminadab 1512 and said unto them ye are the chief of the fathers of the levites sanctify yourselves both ye and your brethren that ye may bring up the ark of the lord god of israel unto the place that i have prepared for it 1513 for because ye did it not at the first the lord our god made a breach upon us for that we sought him not after the due order 1514 so the priests and the levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the lord god of israel 1515 and the children of the levites bare the ark of god upon their shoulders with the staves thereon as moses commanded according to the word of the lord 1516 and david spake to the chief of the levites to appoint their brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick psalteries and harps and cymbals sounding by lifting up the voice with joy 1517 so the levites appointed heman the son of joel and of his brethren asaph the son of berechiah and of the sons of merari their brethren ethan the son of kushaiah 1518 and with them their brethren of the second degree zechariah ben and jaaziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni eliab and benaiah and maaseiah and mattithiah and elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel the porters 1519 so the singers heman asaph and ethan were appointed to sound with cymbals of brass 1520 and zechariah and aziel and shemiramoth and jehiel and unni and eliab and maaseiah and benaiah with psalteries on alamoth 1521 and mattithiah and elipheleh and mikneiah and obededom and jeiel and azaziah with harps on the sheminith to excel 1522 and chenaniah chief of the levites was for song he instructed about the song because he was skilful 1523 and berechiah and elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark 1524 and shebaniah and jehoshaphat and nethaneel and amasai and zechariah and benaiah and eliezer the priests did blow with the trumpets before the ark of god and obededom and jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark 1525 so david and the elders of israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the house of obededom with joy 1526 and it came to pass when god helped the levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the lord that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams 1527 and david was clothed with a robe of fine linen and all the levites that bare the ark and the singers and chenaniah the master of the song with the singers david also had upon him an ephod of linen 1528 thus all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the lord with shouting and with sound of the cornet and with trumpets and with cymbals making a noise with psalteries and harps 1529 and it came to pass as the ark of the covenant of the lord came to the city of david that michal the daughter of saul looking out at a window saw king david dancing and playing and she despised him in her heart 161 so they brought the ark of god and set it in the midst of the tent that david had pitched for it and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before god 162 and when david had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord 163 and he dealt to every one of israel both man and woman to every one a loaf of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine 164 and he appointed certain of the levites to minister before the ark of the lord and to record and to thank and praise the lord god of israel 165 asaph the chief and next to him zechariah jeiel and shemiramoth and jehiel and mattithiah and eliab and benaiah and obededom and jeiel with psalteries and with harps but asaph made a sound with cymbals 166 benaiah also and jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of god 167 then on that day david delivered first this psalm to thank the lord into the hand of asaph and his brethren 168 give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people 169 sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous works 1610 glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord 1611 seek the lord and his strength seek his face continually 1612 remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth 1613 o ye seed of israel his servant ye children of jacob his chosen ones 1614 he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth 1615 be ye mindful always of his covenant the word which he commanded to a thousand generations 1616 even of the covenant which he made with abraham and of his oath unto isaac 1617 and hath confirmed the same to jacob for a law and to israel for an everlasting covenant 1618 saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance 1619 when ye were but few even a few and strangers in it 1620 and when they went from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another people 1621 he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakes 1622 saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm 1623 sing unto the lord all the earth shew forth from day to day his salvation 1624 declare his glory among the heathen his marvellous works among all nations 1625 for great is the lord and greatly to be praised he also is to be feared above all gods 1626 for all the gods of the people are idols but the lord made the heavens 1627 glory and honour are in his presence strength and gladness are in his place 1628 give unto the lord ye kindreds of the people give unto the lord glory and strength 1629 give unto the lord the glory due unto his name bring an offering and come before him worship the lord in the beauty of holiness 1630 fear before him all the earth the world also shall be stable that it be not moved 1631 let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice and let men say among the nations the lord reigneth 1632 let the sea roar and the fulness thereof let the fields rejoice and all that is therein 1633 then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the lord because he cometh to judge the earth 1634 o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever 1635 and say ye save us o god of our salvation and gather us together and deliver us from the heathen that we may give thanks to thy holy name and glory in thy praise 1636 blessed be the lord god of israel for ever and ever and all the people said amen and praised the lord 1637 so he left there before the ark of the covenant of the lord asaph and his brethren to minister before the ark continually as every days work required 1638 and obededom with their brethren threescore and eight obededom also the son of jeduthun and hosah to be porters 1639 and zadok the priest and his brethren the priests before the tabernacle of the lord in the high place that was at gibeon 1640 to offer burnt offerings unto the lord upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening and to do according to all that is written in the law of the lord which he commanded israel 1641 and with them heman and jeduthun and the rest that were chosen who were expressed by name to give thanks to the lord because his mercy endureth for ever 1642 and with them heman and jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound and with musical instruments of god and the sons of jeduthun were porters 1643 and all the people departed every man to his house and david returned to bless his house 171 now it came to pass as david sat in his house that david said to nathan the prophet lo i dwell in an house of cedars but the ark of the covenant of the lord remaineth under curtains 172 then nathan said unto david do all that is in thine heart for god is with thee 173 and it came to pass the same night that the word of god came to nathan saying 174 go and tell david my servant thus saith the lord thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in 175 for i have not dwelt in an house since the day that i brought up israel unto this day but have gone from tent to tent and from one tabernacle to another 176 wheresoever i have walked with all israel spake i a word to any of the judges of israel whom i commanded to feed my people saying why have ye not built me an house of cedars 177 now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant david thus saith the lord of hosts i took thee from the sheepcote even from following the sheep that thou shouldest be ruler over my people israel 178 and i have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth 179 also i will ordain a place for my people israel and will plant them and they shall dwell in their place and shall be moved no more neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more as at the beginning 1710 and since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel moreover i will subdue all thine enemies furthermore i tell thee that the lord will build thee an house 1711 and it shall come to pass when thy days be expired that thou must go to be with thy fathers that i will raise up thy seed after thee which shall be of thy sons and i will establish his kingdom 1712 he shall build me an house and i will stablish his throne for ever 1713 i will be his father and he shall be my son and i will not take my mercy away from him as i took it from him that was before thee 1714 but i will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever and his throne shall be established for evermore 1715 according to all these words and according to all this vision so did nathan speak unto david 1716 and david the king came and sat before the lord and said who am i o lord god and what is mine house that thou hast brought me hitherto 1717 and yet this was a small thing in thine eyes o god for thou hast also spoken of thy servants house for a great while to come and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree o lord god 1718 what can david speak more to thee for the honour of thy servant for thou knowest thy servant 1719 o lord for thy servants sake and according to thine own heart hast thou done all this greatness in making known all these great things 1720 o lord there is none like thee neither is there any god beside thee according to all that we have heard with our ears 1721 and what one nation in the earth is like thy people israel whom god went to redeem to be his own people to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness by driving out nations from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of egypt 1722 for thy people israel didst thou make thine own people for ever and thou lord becamest their god 1723 therefore now lord let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever and do as thou hast said 1724 let it even be established that thy name may be magnified for ever saying the lord of hosts is the god of israel even a god to israel and let the house of david thy servant be established before thee 1725 for thou o my god hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray before thee 1726 and now lord thou art god and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant 1727 now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant that it may be before thee for ever for thou blessest o lord and it shall be blessed for ever 181 now after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and took gath and her towns out of the hand of the philistines 182 and he smote moab and the moabites became davids servants and brought gifts 183 and david smote hadarezer king of zobah unto hamath as he went to stablish his dominion by the river euphrates 184 and david took from him a thousand chariots and seven thousand horsemen and twenty thousand footmen david also houghed all the chariot horses but reserved of them an hundred chariots 185 and when the syrians of damascus came to help hadarezer king of zobah david slew of the syrians two and twenty thousand men 186 then david put garrisons in syriadamascus and the syrians became davids servants and brought gifts thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went 187 and david took the shields of gold that were on the servants of hadarezer and brought them to jerusalem 188 likewise from tibhath and from chun cities of hadarezer brought david very much brass wherewith solomon made the brasen sea and the pillars and the vessels of brass 189 now when tou king of hamath heard how david had smitten all the host of hadarezer king of zobah 1810 he sent hadoram his son to king david to enquire of his welfare and to congratulate him because he had fought against hadarezer and smitten him for hadarezer had war with tou and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass 1811 them also king david dedicated unto the lord with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations from edom and from moab and from the children of ammon and from the philistines and from amalek 1812 moreover abishai the son of zeruiah slew of the edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand 1813 and he put garrisons in edom and all the edomites became davids servants thus the lord preserved david whithersoever he went 1814 so david reigned over all israel and executed judgment and justice among all his people 1815 and joab the son of zeruiah was over the host and jehoshaphat the son of ahilud recorder 1816 and zadok the son of ahitub and abimelech the son of abiathar were the priests and shavsha was scribe 1817 and benaiah the son of jehoiada was over the cherethites and the pelethites and the sons of david were chief about the king 191 now it came to pass after this that nahash the king of the children of ammon died and his son reigned in his stead 192 and david said i will shew kindness unto hanun the son of nahash because his father shewed kindness to me and david sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father so the servants of david came into the land of the children of ammon to hanun to comfort him 193 but the princes of the children of ammon said to hanun thinkest thou that david doth honour thy father that he hath sent comforters unto thee are not his servants come unto thee for to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land 194 wherefore hanun took davids servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks and sent them away 195 then there went certain and told david how the men were served and he sent to meet them for the men were greatly ashamed and the king said tarry at jericho until your beards be grown and then return 196 and when the children of ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to david hanun and the children of ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of mesopotamia and out of syriamaachah and out of zobah 197 so they hired thirty and two thousand chariots and the king of maachah and his people who came and pitched before medeba and the children of ammon gathered themselves together from their cities and came to battle 198 and when david heard of it he sent joab and all the host of the mighty men 199 and the children of ammon came out and put the battle in array before the gate of the city and the kings that were come were by themselves in the field 1910 now when joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind he chose out of all the choice of israel and put them in array against the syrians 1911 and the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of abishai his brother and they set themselves in array against the children of ammon 1912 and he said if the syrians be too strong for me then thou shalt help me but if the children of ammon be too strong for thee then i will help thee 1913 be of good courage and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people and for the cities of our god and let the lord do that which is good in his sight 1914 so joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the syrians unto the battle and they fled before him 1915 and when the children of ammon saw that the syrians were fled they likewise fled before abishai his brother and entered into the city then joab came to jerusalem 1916 and when the syrians saw that they were put to the worse before israel they sent messengers and drew forth the syrians that were beyond the river and shophach the captain of the host of hadarezer went before them 1917 and it was told david and he gathered all israel and passed over jordan and came upon them and set the battle in array against them so when david had put the battle in array against the syrians they fought with him 1918 but the syrians fled before israel and david slew of the syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots and forty thousand footmen and killed shophach the captain of the host 1919 and when the servants of hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before israel they made peace with david and became his servants neither would the syrians help the children of ammon any more 201 and it came to pass that after the year was expired at the time that kings go out to battle joab led forth the power of the army and wasted the country of the children of ammon and came and besieged rabbah but david tarried at jerusalem and joab smote rabbah and destroyed it 202 and david took the crown of their king from off his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold and there were precious stones in it and it was set upon davids head and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city 203 and he brought out the people that were in it and cut them with saws and with harrows of iron and with axes even so dealt david with all the cities of the children of ammon and david and all the people returned to jerusalem 204 and it came to pass after this that there arose war at gezer with the philistines at which time sibbechai the hushathite slew sippai that was of the children of the giant and they were subdued 205 and there was war again with the philistines and elhanan the son of jair slew lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite whose spear staff was like a weavers beam 206 and yet again there was war at gath where was a man of great stature whose fingers and toes were four and twenty six on each hand and six on each foot and he also was the son of the giant 207 but when he defied israel jonathan the son of shimea davids brother slew him 208 these were born unto the giant in gath and they fell by the hand of david and by the hand of his servants 211 and satan stood up against israel and provoked david to number israel 212 and david said to joab and to the rulers of the people go number israel from beersheba even to dan and bring the number of them to me that i may know it 213 and joab answered the lord make his people an hundred times so many more as they be but my lord the king are they not all my lords servants why then doth my lord require this thing why will he be a cause of trespass to israel 214 nevertheless the kings word prevailed against joab wherefore joab departed and went throughout all israel and came to jerusalem 215 and joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto david and all they of israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword and judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword 216 but levi and benjamin counted he not among them for the kings word was abominable to joab 217 and god was displeased with this thing therefore he smote israel 218 and david said unto god i have sinned greatly because i have done this thing but now i beseech thee do away the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly 219 and the lord spake unto gad davids seer saying 2110 go and tell david saying thus saith the lord i offer thee three things choose thee one of them that i may do it unto thee 2111 so gad came to david and said unto him thus saith the lord choose thee 2112 either three years famine or three months to be destroyed before thy foes while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee or else three days the sword of the lord even the pestilence in the land and the angel of the lord destroying throughout all the coasts of israel now therefore advise thyself what word i shall bring again to him that sent me 2113 and david said unto gad i am in a great strait let me fall now into the hand of the lord for very great are his mercies but let me not fall into the hand of man 2114 so the lord sent pestilence upon israel and there fell of israel seventy thousand men 2115 and god sent an angel unto jerusalem to destroy it and as he was destroying the lord beheld and he repented him of the evil and said to the angel that destroyed it is enough stay now thine hand and the angel of the lord stood by the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite 2116 and david lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the lord stand between the earth and the heaven having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over jerusalem then david and the elders of israel who were clothed in sackcloth fell upon their faces 2117 and david said unto god is it not i that commanded the people to be numbered even i it is that have sinned and done evil indeed but as for these sheep what have they done let thine hand i pray thee o lord my god be on me and on my fathers house but not on thy people that they should be plagued 2118 then the angel of the lord commanded gad to say to david that david should go up and set up an altar unto the lord in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite 2119 and david went up at the saying of gad which he spake in the name of the lord 2120 and ornan turned back and saw the angel and his four sons with him hid themselves now ornan was threshing wheat 2121 and as david came to ornan ornan looked and saw david and went out of the threshingfloor and bowed himself to david with his face to the ground 2122 then david said to ornan grant me the place of this threshingfloor that i may build an altar therein unto the lord thou shalt grant it me for the full price that the plague may be stayed from the people 2123 and ornan said unto david take it to thee and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes lo i give thee the oxen also for burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and the wheat for the meat offering i give it all 2124 and king david said to ornan nay but i will verily buy it for the full price for i will not take that which is thine for the lord nor offer burnt offerings without cost 2125 so david gave to ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight 2126 and david built there an altar unto the lord and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings and called upon the lord and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering 2127 and the lord commanded the angel and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof 2128 at that time when david saw that the lord had answered him in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite then he sacrificed there 2129 for the tabernacle of the lord which moses made in the wilderness and the altar of the burnt offering were at that season in the high place at gibeon 2130 but david could not go before it to enquire of god for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the lord 221 then david said this is the house of the lord god and this is the altar of the burnt offering for israel 222 and david commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of israel and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of god 223 and david prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates and for the joinings and brass in abundance without weight 224 also cedar trees in abundance for the zidonians and they of tyre brought much cedar wood to david 225 and david said solomon my son is young and tender and the house that is to be builded for the lord must be exceeding magnifical of fame and of glory throughout all countries i will therefore now make preparation for it so david prepared abundantly before his death 226 then he called for solomon his son and charged him to build an house for the lord god of israel 227 and david said to solomon my son as for me it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the lord my god 228 but the word of the lord came to me saying thou hast shed blood abundantly and hast made great wars thou shalt not build an house unto my name because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight 229 behold a son shall be born to thee who shall be a man of rest and i will give him rest from all his enemies round about for his name shall be solomon and i will give peace and quietness unto israel in his days 2210 he shall build an house for my name and he shall be my son and i will be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel for ever 2211 now my son the lord be with thee and prosper thou and build the house of the lord thy god as he hath said of thee 2212 only the lord give thee wisdom and understanding and give thee charge concerning israel that thou mayest keep the law of the lord thy god 2213 then shalt thou prosper if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the lord charged moses with concerning israel be strong and of good courage dread not nor be dismayed 2214 now behold in my trouble i have prepared for the house of the lord an hundred thousand talents of gold and a thousand thousand talents of silver and of brass and iron without weight for it is in abundance timber also and stone have i prepared and thou mayest add thereto 2215 moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance hewers and workers of stone and timber and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work 2216 of the gold the silver and the brass and the iron there is no number arise therefore and be doing and the lord be with thee 2217 david also commanded all the princes of israel to help solomon his son saying 2218 is not the lord your god with you and hath he not given you rest on every side for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand and the land is subdued before the lord and before his people 2219 now set your heart and your soul to seek the lord your god arise therefore and build ye the sanctuary of the lord god to bring the ark of the covenant of the lord and the holy vessels of god into the house that is to be built to the name of the lord 231 so when david was old and full of days he made solomon his son king over israel 232 and he gathered together all the princes of israel with the priests and the levites 233 now the levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward and their number by their polls man by man was thirty and eight thousand 234 of which twenty and four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the lord and six thousand were officers and judges 235 moreover four thousand were porters and four thousand praised the lord with the instruments which i made said david to praise therewith 236 and david divided them into courses among the sons of levi namely gershon kohath and merari 237 of the gershonites were laadan and shimei 238 the sons of laadan the chief was jehiel and zetham and joel three 239 the sons of shimei shelomith and haziel and haran three these were the chief of the fathers of laadan 2310 and the sons of shimei were jahath zina and jeush and beriah these four were the sons of shimei 2311 and jahath was the chief and zizah the second but jeush and beriah had not many sons therefore they were in one reckoning according to their fathers house 2312 the sons of kohath amram izhar hebron and uzziel four 2313 the sons of amram aaron and moses and aaron was separated that he should sanctify the most holy things he and his sons for ever to burn incense before the lord to minister unto him and to bless in his name for ever 2314 now concerning moses the man of god his sons were named of the tribe of levi 2315 the sons of moses were gershom and eliezer 2316 of the sons of gershom shebuel was the chief 2317 and the sons of eliezer were rehabiah the chief and eliezer had none other sons but the sons of rehabiah were very many 2318 of the sons of izhar shelomith the chief 2319 of the sons of hebron jeriah the first amariah the second jahaziel the third and jekameam the fourth 2320 of the sons of uzziel micah the first and jesiah the second 2321 the sons of merari mahli and mushi the sons of mahli eleazar and kish 2322 and eleazar died and had no sons but daughters and their brethren the sons of kish took them 2323 the sons of mushi mahli and eder and jeremoth three 2324 these were the sons of levi after the house of their fathers even the chief of the fathers as they were counted by number of names by their polls that did the work for the service of the house of the lord from the age of twenty years and upward 2325 for david said the lord god of israel hath given rest unto his people that they may dwell in jerusalem for ever 2326 and also unto the levites they shall no more carry the tabernacle nor any vessels of it for the service thereof 2327 for by the last words of david the levites were numbered from twenty years old and above 2328 because their office was to wait on the sons of aaron for the service of the house of the lord in the courts and in the chambers and in the purifying of all holy things and the work of the service of the house of god 2329 both for the shewbread and for the fine flour for meat offering and for the unleavened cakes and for that which is baked in the pan and for that which is fried and for all manner of measure and size 2330 and to stand every morning to thank and praise the lord and likewise at even 2331 and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the lord in the sabbaths in the new moons and on the set feasts by number according to the order commanded unto them continually before the lord 2332 and that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation and the charge of the holy place and the charge of the sons of aaron their brethren in the service of the house of the lord 241 now these are the divisions of the sons of aaron the sons of aaron nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar 242 but nadab and abihu died before their father and had no children therefore eleazar and ithamar executed the priests office 243 and david distributed them both zadok of the sons of eleazar and ahimelech of the sons of ithamar according to their offices in their service 244 and there were more chief men found of the sons of eleazar than of the sons of ithamar and thus were they divided among the sons of eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house of their fathers and eight among the sons of ithamar according to the house of their fathers 245 thus were they divided by lot one sort with another for the governors of the sanctuary and governors of the house of god were of the sons of eleazar and of the sons of ithamar 246 and shemaiah the son of nethaneel the scribe one of the levites wrote them before the king and the princes and zadok the priest and ahimelech the son of abiathar and before the chief of the fathers of the priests and levites one principal household being taken for eleazar and one taken for ithamar 247 now the first lot came forth to jehoiarib the second to jedaiah 248 the third to harim the fourth to seorim 249 the fifth

david took not the number of them from twenty years old and under because the lord had said he would increase israel like to the stars of the heavens 2724 joab the son of zeruiah began to number but

the hundreds and the stewards over all the substance and possession of the king and of his sons with the officers and with the mighty men and with all the valiant men unto jerusalem 282 then david the king stood up upon his feet and said hear me my brethren and my people as for me i had in mine heart to build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the lord and for the footstool of our god and had made ready for the building 283 but god said unto me thou shalt not build an house for my name because thou hast been a man of war and hast shed blood 284 howbeit the lord god of israel chose me before all the house of my father to be king over israel for ever for he hath chosen judah to be the ruler and of the house of judah the house of my father and among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all israel 285 and of all my sons for the lord hath given me many sons he hath chosen solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the lord over israel 286 and he said unto me solomon thy son he shall build my house and my courts for i have chosen him to be my son and i will be his father 287 moreover i will establish his kingdom for ever if he be constant to do my commandments and my judgments as at this day 288 now therefore in the sight of all israel the congregation of the lord and in the audience of our god keep and seek for all the commandments of the lord your god that ye may possess this good land and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for ever 289 and thou solomon my son know thou the god of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind for the lord searcheth all hearts and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts if thou seek him he will be found of thee but if thou forsake him he will cast thee off for ever 2810 take heed now for the lord hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary be strong and do it 2811 then david gave to solomon his son the pattern of the porch and of the houses thereof and of the treasuries thereof and of the upper chambers thereof and of the inner parlours thereof and of the place of the mercy seat 2812 and the pattern of all that he had by the spirit of the courts of the house of the lord and of all the chambers round about of the treasuries of the house of god and of the treasuries of the dedicated things 2813 also for the courses

will not fail thee nor forsake thee until thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the lord 2821 and behold the courses of the priests and the levites even they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of god and there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing skilful man for any manner of service also the princes and all the people will be wholly at thy commandment 291 furthermore david the king said unto all the congregation solomon my son whom alone god hath chosen is yet young and tender and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for the lord god 292 now i have prepared with all my might for the house of my god the gold for things to be made of gold and the silver for things of silver and the brass for things of brass the iron for things of iron and wood for things of wood onyx stones and stones to be set glistering stones and of divers colours and all manner of precious stones and marble stones in abundance

and the silver for things of silver and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers and who then is willing to consecrate his service this day unto the lord 296 then the chief of the

were found gave them to the treasure of the house of the lord by the hand of jehiel the gershonite 299 then the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the lord and david the king also rejoiced with great joy 2910 wherefore david blessed the lord before all the congregation and david said blessed be thou lord god of israel our father for ever and ever 2911 thine o lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine thine is the kingdom o lord and thou art exalted as head above all 2912 both riches and honour come of thee and thou reignest over all and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it is to make great and to give strength unto all 2913 now therefore our god we thank thee and praise thy glorious name 2914 but who am i and what is my people that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee 2915 for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all our fathers our days on the earth are as a shadow and there is none abiding 2916 o lord our god all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand and is all thine own 2917 i know also my god that thou triest the heart and hast pleasure in uprightness as for me in the uprightness of mine heart i have willingly offered all these things and now have i seen with joy thy people which are present here to offer willingly unto thee 2918 o lord god of abraham isaac and of israel our fathers keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people and prepare their heart unto thee 2919 and give unto solomon my son a perfect heart to keep thy commandments thy testimonies and thy statutes and to do all these things and to build the palace for the which i have made provision 2920 and david said to all the congregation now bless the lord your god and all the congregation blessed the lord god of their fathers and bowed down their heads and worshipped the lord and the king 2921 and they sacrificed sacrifices unto the lord and offered burnt offerings unto the lord on the morrow after that day even a thousand bullocks a thousand rams and a thousand lambs with their drink offerings and sacrifices in abundance for all israel 2922 and did eat and drink before the lord on that day with great gladness and they made solomon the son of david king the second time and anointed him unto the lord to be the chief governor and zadok to be priest 2923 then solomon sat on the throne of the lord as king instead of david his father and prospered and all israel obeyed him 2924 and all the princes and the mighty men and all the sons likewise of king david submitted themselves unto solomon the king 2925 and the lord magnified solomon exceedingly in the sight of all israel and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in israel 2926 thus david the son of jesse reigned over all israel 2927 and the time that he reigned over israel was forty years seven years reigned he in hebron and thirty and three years reigned he in jerusalem 2928 and he died in a good old age full of days riches and honour and solomon his son reigned in his stead 2929 now the acts of david the king first and last behold they are written in the book of samuel the seer and in the book of nathan the prophet and in the book of gad the seer 2930 with all his reign and his might and the times that went over him and over israel and over all the kingdoms of the countries the second book of the chronicles 11 and solomon the son of david was strengthened in his kingdom and the lord his god was with him and magnified him exceedingly 12 then solomon spake unto all israel to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every governor in all israel the chief of the fathers 13 so solomon and all the congregation with him went to the high place that was at gibeon for there was the tabernacle of the congregation of god which moses the servant of the lord had made in the wilderness 14 but the ark of god had david brought up from kirjathjearim to the place which david had prepared for it for he had pitched a tent for it at jerusalem 15 moreover the brasen altar that bezaleel the son of uri the son of hur had made he put before the tabernacle of the lord and solomon and the congregation sought unto it 16 and solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the lord which was at the tabernacle of the congregation and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it 17 in that night did god appear unto solomon and said unto him ask what i shall give thee 18 and solomon said unto god thou hast shewed great mercy unto david my father and hast made me to reign in his stead 19 now o lord god let thy promise unto david my father be established for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of the earth in multitude 110 give me now wisdom and knowledge that i may go out and come in before this people for who can judge this thy people that is so great 111 and god said to solomon because this was in thine heart and thou hast not asked riches wealth or honour nor the life of thine enemies neither yet hast asked long life but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself that thou mayest judge my people over whom i have made thee king 112 wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee and i will give thee riches and wealth and honour such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee neither shall there any after thee have the like 113 then solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at gibeon to jerusalem from before the tabernacle of the congregation and reigned over israel 114 and solomon gathered chariots and horsemen and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen which he placed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem 115 and the king made silver and gold at jerusalem as plenteous as stones and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the vale for abundance 116 and solomon had horses brought out of egypt and linen yarn the kings merchants received the linen yarn at a price 117 and they fetched up and brought forth out of egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver and an horse for an hundred and fifty and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the hittites and for the kings of syria by their means 21 and solomon determined to build an house for the name of the lord and an house for his kingdom 22 and solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear burdens and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain and three thousand and six hundred to oversee them 23 and solomon sent to huram the king of tyre saying as thou didst deal with david my father and didst send him cedars to build him an house to dwell therein even so deal with me 24 behold i build an house to the name of the lord my god to dedicate it to him and to burn before him sweet incense and for the continual shewbread and for the burnt offerings morning and evening on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts of the lord our god this is an ordinance for ever to israel 25 and the house which i build is great for great is our god above all gods 26 but who is able to build him an house seeing the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain him who am i then that i should build him an house save only to burn sacrifice before him 27 send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in iron and in purple and crimson and blue and that can skill to grave with the cunning men that are with me in judah and in jerusalem whom david my father did provide 28 send me also cedar trees fir trees and algum trees out of lebanon for i know that thy servants can skill to cut timber in lebanon and behold my servants shall be with thy servants 29 even to prepare me timber in abundance for the house which i am about to build shall be wonderful great 210 and behold i will give to thy servants the hewers that cut timber twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of oil 211 then huram the king of tyre answered in writing which he sent to solomon because the lord hath loved his people he hath made thee king over them 212 huram said moreover blessed be the lord god of israel that made heaven and earth who hath given to david the king a wise son endued with prudence and understanding that might build an house for the lord and an house for his kingdom 213 and now i have sent a cunning man endued with understanding of huram my fathers 214 the son of a woman of the daughters of dan and his father was a man of tyre skilful to work in gold and in silver in brass in iron in stone and in timber in purple in blue and in fine linen and in crimson also to grave any manner of graving and to find out every device which shall be put to him with thy cunning men and with the cunning men of my lord david thy father 215 now therefore the wheat and the barley the oil and the wine which my lord hath spoken of let him send unto his servants 216 and we will cut wood out of lebanon as much as thou shalt need and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to joppa and thou shalt carry it up to jerusalem 217 and solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of israel after the numbering wherewith david his father had numbered them and they were found an hundred and fifty thousand and three thousand and six hundred 218 and he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers of burdens and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the mountain and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set the people a work 31 then solomon began to build the house of the lord at jerusalem in mount moriah where the lord appeared unto david his father in the place that david had prepared in the threshingfloor of ornan the jebusite 32 and he began to build in the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign 33 now these are the things wherein solomon was instructed for the building of the house of god the length by cubits after the first measure was threescore cubits and the breadth twenty cubits 34 and the porch that was in the front of the house the length of it was according to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the height was an hundred and twenty and he overlaid it within with pure gold 35 and the greater house he cieled with fir tree which he overlaid with fine gold and set thereon palm trees and chains 36 and he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty and the gold was gold of parvaim 37 he overlaid also the house the beams the posts and the walls thereof and the doors thereof with gold and graved cherubims on the walls 38 and he made the most holy house the length whereof was according to the breadth of the house twenty cubits and the breadth thereof twenty cubits and he overlaid it with fine gold amounting to six hundred talents 39 and the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold and he overlaid the upper chambers with gold 310 and in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image work and overlaid them with gold 311 and the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long one wing of the one cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was likewise five cubits reaching to the wing of the other cherub 312 and one wing of the other cherub was five cubits reaching to the wall of the house and the other wing was five cubits also joining to the wing of the other cherub 313 the wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty cubits and they stood on their feet and their faces were inward 314 and he made the vail of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen and wrought cherubims thereon 315 also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five cubits high and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits 316 and he made chains as in the oracle and put them on the heads of the pillars and made an hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains 317 and he reared up the pillars before the temple one on the right hand and the other on the left and called the name of that on the right hand jachin and the name of that on the left boaz 41 moreover he made an altar of brass twenty cubits the length thereof and twenty cubits the breadth thereof and ten cubits the height thereof 42 also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim round in compass and five cubits the height thereof and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about 43 and under it was the similitude of oxen which did compass it round about ten in a cubit compassing the sea round about two rows of oxen were cast when it was cast 44 it stood upon twelve oxen three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the south and three looking toward the east and the sea was set above upon them and all their hinder parts were inward 45 and the thickness of it was an handbreadth and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies and it received and held three thousand baths 46 he made also ten lavers and put five on the right hand and five on the left to wash in them such things as they offered for the burnt offering they washed in them but the sea was for the priests to wash in 47 and he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form and set them in the temple five on the right hand and five on the left 48 he made also ten tables and placed them in the temple five on the right side and five on the left and he made an hundred basons of gold 49 furthermore he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid the doors of them with brass 410 and he set the sea on the right side of the east end over against the south 411 and huram made the pots and the shovels and the basons and huram finished the work that he was to make for king solomon for the house of god 412 to wit the two pillars and the pommels and the chapiters which were on the top of the two pillars and the two wreaths to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars 413 and four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths two rows of pomegranates on each wreath to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars 414 he made also bases and lavers made he upon the bases 415 one sea and twelve oxen under it 416 the pots also and the shovels and the fleshhooks and all their instruments did huram his father make to king solomon for the house of the lord of bright brass 417 in the plain of jordan did the king cast them in the clay ground between succoth and zeredathah 418 thus solomon made all these vessels in great abundance for the weight of the brass could not be found out 419 and solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of god the golden altar also and the tables whereon the shewbread was set 420 moreover the candlesticks with their lamps that they should burn after the manner before the oracle of pure gold 421 and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs made he of gold and that perfect gold 422 and the snuffers and the basons and the spoons and the censers of pure gold and the entry of the house the inner doors thereof for the most holy place and the doors of the house of the temple were of gold 51 thus all the work that solomon made for the house of the lord was finished and solomon brought in all the things that david his father had dedicated and the silver and the gold and all the instruments put he among the treasures of the house of god 52 then solomon assembled the elders of israel and all the heads of the tribes the chief of the fathers of the children of israel unto jerusalem to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord out of the city of david which is zion 53 wherefore all the men of israel assembled themselves unto the king in the feast which was in the seventh month 54 and all the elders of israel came and the levites took up the ark 55 and they brought up the ark and the tabernacle of the congregation and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle these did the priests and the levites bring up 56 also king solomon and all the congregation of israel that were assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen which could not be told nor numbered for multitude 57 and the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the lord unto his place to the oracle of the house into the most holy place even under the wings of the cherubims 58 for the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the ark and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above 59 and they drew out the staves of the ark that the ends of the staves were seen from the ark before the oracle but they were not seen without and there it is unto this day 510 there was nothing in the ark save the two tables which moses put therein at horeb when the lord made a covenant with the children of israel when they came out of egypt 511 and it came to pass when the priests were come out of the holy place for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did not then wait by course 512 also the levites which were the singers all of them of asaph of heman of jeduthun with their sons and their brethren being arrayed in white linen having cymbals and psalteries and harps stood at the east end of the altar and with them an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets 513 it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick and praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever that then the house was filled with a cloud even the house of the lord 514 so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of god 61 then said solomon the lord hath said that he would dwell in the thick darkness 62 but i have built an house of habitation for thee and a place for thy dwelling for ever 63 and the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of israel and all the congregation of israel stood 64 and he said blessed be the lord god of israel who hath with his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my father david saying 65 since the day that i brought forth my people out of the land of egypt i chose no city among all the tribes of israel to build an house in that my name might be there neither chose i any man to be a ruler over my people israel 66 but i have chosen jerusalem that my name might be there and have chosen david to be over my people israel 67 now it was in the heart of david my father to build an house for the name of the lord god of israel 68 but the lord said to david my father forasmuch as it was in thine heart to build an house for my name thou didst well in that it was in thine heart 69 notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house for my name 610 the lord therefore hath performed his word that he hath spoken for i am risen up in the room of david my father and am set on the throne of israel as the lord promised and have built the house for the name of the lord god of israel 611 and in it have i put the ark wherein is the covenant of the lord that he made with the children of israel 612 and he stood before the altar of the lord in the presence of all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands 613 for solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long and five cubits broad and three cubits high and had set it in the midst of the court and upon it he stood and kneeled down upon his knees before all the congregation of israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven 614 and said o lord god of israel there is no god like thee in the heaven nor in the earth which keepest covenant and shewest mercy unto thy servants that walk before thee with all their hearts 615 thou which hast kept with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him and spakest with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thine hand as it is this day 616 now therefore o lord god of israel keep with thy servant david my father that which thou hast promised him saying there shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the throne of israel yet so that thy children take heed to their way to walk in my law as thou hast walked before me 617 now then o lord god of israel let thy word be verified which thou hast spoken unto thy servant david 618 but will god in very deed dwell with men on the earth behold heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house which i have built 619 have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication o lord my god to hearken unto the cry and the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee 620 that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put thy name there to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant prayeth toward this place 621 hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant and of thy people israel which they shall make toward this place hear thou from thy dwelling place even from heaven and when thou hearest forgive 622 if a man sin against his neighbour and an oath be laid upon him to make him swear and the oath come before thine altar in this house 623 then hear thou from heaven and do and judge thy servants by requiting the wicked by recompensing his way upon his own head and by justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness 624 and if thy people israel be put to the worse before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall return and confess thy name and pray and make supplication before thee in this house 625 then hear thou from the heavens and forgive the sin of thy people israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers 626 when the heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee yet if they pray toward this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou dost afflict them 627 then hear thou from heaven and forgive the sin of thy servants and of thy people israel when thou hast taught them the good way wherein they should walk and send rain upon thy land which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance 628 if there be dearth in the land if there be pestilence if there be blasting or mildew locusts or caterpillers if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be 629 then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of any man or of all thy people israel when every one shall know his own sore and his own grief and shall spread forth his hands in this house 630 then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place and forgive and render unto every man according unto all his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou only knowest the hearts of the children of men 631 that they may fear thee to walk in thy ways so long as they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers 632 moreover concerning the stranger which is not of thy people israel but is come from a far country for thy great names sake and thy mighty hand and thy stretched out arm if they come and pray in this house 633 then hear thou from the heavens even from thy dwelling place and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for that all people of the earth may know thy name and fear thee as doth thy people israel and may know that this house which i have built is called by thy name 634 if thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen and the house which i have built for thy name 635 then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication and maintain their cause 636 if they sin against thee for there is no man which sinneth not and thou be angry with them and deliver them over before their enemies and they carry them away captives unto a land far off or near 637 yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are carried captive and turn and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity saying we have sinned we have done amiss and have dealt wickedly 638 if they return to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity whither they have carried them captives and pray toward their land which thou gavest unto their fathers and toward the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house which i have built for thy name 639 then hear thou from the heavens even from thy dwelling place their prayer and their supplications and maintain their cause and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee 640 now my god let i beseech thee thine eyes be open and let thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this place 641 now therefore arise o lord god into thy resting place thou and the ark of thy strength let thy priests o lord god be clothed with salvation and let thy saints rejoice in goodness 642 o lord god turn not away the face of thine anointed remember the mercies of david thy servant 71 now when solomon had made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the lord filled the house 72 and the priests could not enter into the house of the lord because the glory of the lord had filled the lords house 73 and when all the children of israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the lord upon the house they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshipped and praised the lord saying for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever 74 then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the lord 75 and king solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep so the king and all the people dedicated the house of god 76 and the priests waited on their offices the levites also with instruments of musick of the lord which david the king had made to praise the lord because his mercy endureth for ever when david praised by their ministry and the priests sounded trumpets before them and all israel stood 77 moreover solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the lord for there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the brasen altar which solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings and the meat offerings and the fat 78 also at the same time solomon kept the feast seven days and all israel with him a very great congregation from the entering in of hamath unto the river of egypt 79 and in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days and the feast seven days 710 and on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the lord had shewed unto david and to solomon and to israel his people 711 thus solomon finished the house of the lord and the kings house and all that came into solomons heart to make in the house of the lord and in his own house he prosperously effected 712 and the lord appeared to solomon by night and said unto him i have heard thy prayer and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice 713 if i shut up heaven that there be no rain or if i command the locusts to devour the land or if i send pestilence among my people 714 if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land 715 now mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attent unto the prayer that is made in this place 716 for now have i chosen and sanctified this house that my name may be there for ever and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually 717 and as for thee if thou wilt walk before me as david thy father walked and do according to all that i have commanded thee and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments 718 then will i stablish the throne of thy kingdom according as i have covenanted with david thy father saying there shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in israel 719 but if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments which i have set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship them 720 then will i pluck them up by the roots out of my land which i have given them and this house which i have sanctified for my name will i cast out of my sight and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations 721 and this house which is high shall be an astonishment to every one that passeth by it so that he shall say why hath the lord done thus unto this land and unto this house 722 and it shall be answered because they forsook the lord god of their fathers which brought them forth out of the land of egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshipped them and served them therefore hath he brought all this evil upon them 81 and it came to pass at the end of twenty years wherein solomon had built the house of the lord and his own house 82 that the cities which huram had restored to solomon solomon built them and caused the children of israel to dwell there 83 and solomon went to hamathzobah and prevailed against it 84 and he built tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities which he built in hamath 85 also he built bethhoron the upper and bethhoron the nether fenced cities with walls gates and bars 86 and baalath and all the store cities that solomon had and all the chariot cities and the cities of the horsemen and all that solomon desired to build in jerusalem and in lebanon and throughout all the land of his dominion 87 as for all the people that were left of the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites which were not of israel 88 but of their children who were left after them in the land whom the children of israel consumed not them did solomon make to pay tribute until this day 89 but of the children of israel did solomon make no servants for his work but they were men of war and chief of his captains and captains of his chariots and horsemen 810 and these were the chief of king solomons officers even two hundred and fifty that bare rule over the people 811 and solomon brought up the daughter of pharaoh out of the city of david unto the house that he had built for her for he said my wife shall not dwell in the house of david king of israel because the places are holy whereunto the ark of the lord hath come 812 then solomon offered burnt offerings unto the lord on the altar of the lord which he had built before the porch 813 even after a certain rate every day offering according to the commandment of moses on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the solemn feasts three times in the year even in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of tabernacles 814 and he appointed according to the order of david his father the courses of the priests to their service and the levites to their charges to praise and minister before the priests as the duty of every day required the porters also by their courses at every gate for so had david the man of god commanded 815 and they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasures 816 now all the work of solomon was prepared unto the day of the foundation of the house of the lord and until it was finished so the house of the lord was perfected 817 then went solomon to eziongeber and to eloth at the sea side in the land of edom 818 and huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships and servants that had knowledge of the sea and they went with the servants of solomon to ophir and took thence four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to king solomon 91 and when the queen of sheba heard of the fame of solomon she came to prove solomon with hard questions at jerusalem with a very great company and camels that bare spices and gold in abundance and precious stones and when she was come to solomon she communed with him of all that was in her heart 92 and solomon told her all her questions and there was nothing hid from solomon which he told her not 93 and when the queen of sheba had seen the wisdom of solomon and the house that he had built 94 and the meat of his table and the sitting of his servants and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel his cupbearers also and their apparel and his ascent by which he went up into the house of the lord there was no more spirit in her 95 and she said to the king it was a true report which i heard in mine own land of thine acts and of thy wisdom 96 howbeit i believed not their words until i came and mine eyes had seen it and behold the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me for thou exceedest the fame that i heard 97 happy are thy men and happy are these thy servants which stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom 98 blessed be the lord thy god which delighted in thee to set thee on his throne to be king for the lord thy god because thy god loved israel to establish them for ever therefore made he thee king over them to do judgment and justice 99 and she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices great abundance and precious stones neither was there any such spice as the queen of sheba gave king solomon 910 and the servants also of huram and the servants of solomon which brought gold from ophir brought algum trees and precious stones 911 and the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of the lord and to the kings palace and harps and psalteries for singers and there were none such seen before in the land of judah 912 and king solomon gave to the queen of sheba all her desire whatsoever she asked beside that which she had brought unto the king so she turned and went away to her own land she and her servants 913 now the weight of gold that came to solomon in one year was six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold 914 beside that which chapmen and merchants brought and all the kings of arabia and governors of the country brought gold and silver to solomon 915 and king solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target 916 and three hundred shields made he of beaten gold three hundred shekels of gold went to one shield and the king put them in the house of the forest of lebanon 917 moreover the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold 918 and there were six steps to the throne with a footstool of gold which were fastened to the throne and stays on each side of the sitting place and two lions standing by the stays 919 and twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps there was not the like made in any kingdom 920 and all the drinking vessels of king solomon were of gold and all the vessels of the house of the forest of lebanon were of pure gold none were of silver it was not any thing accounted of in the days of solomon 921 for the kings ships went to tarshish with the servants of huram every three years once came the ships of tarshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks 922 and king solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom 923 and all the kings of the earth sought the presence of solomon to hear his wisdom that god had put in his heart 924 and they brought every man his present vessels of silver and vessels of gold and raiment harness and spices horses and mules a rate year by year 925 and solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and twelve thousand horsemen whom he bestowed in the chariot cities and with the king at jerusalem 926 and he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the philistines and to the border of egypt 927 and the king made silver in jerusalem as stones and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains in abundance 928 and they brought unto solomon horses out of egypt and out of all lands 929 now the rest of the acts of solomon first and last are they not written in the book of nathan the prophet and in the prophecy of ahijah the shilonite and in the visions of iddo the seer against jeroboam the son of nebat 930 and solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel forty years 931 and solomon slept with his fathers and he was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son reigned in his stead 101 and rehoboam went to shechem for to shechem were all israel come to make him king 102 and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nebat who was in egypt whither he fled from the presence of solomon the king heard it that jeroboam returned out of egypt 103 and they sent and called him so jeroboam and all israel came and spake to rehoboam saying 104 thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us and we will serve thee 105 and he said unto them come again unto me after three days and the people departed 106 and king rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before solomon his father while he yet lived saying what counsel give ye me to return answer to this people 107 and they spake unto him saying if thou be kind to this people and please them and speak good words to them they will be thy servants for ever 108 but he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him that stood before him 109 and he said unto them what advice give ye that we may return answer to this people which have spoken to me saying ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us 1010 and the young men that were brought up with him spake unto him saying thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto thee saying thy father made our yoke heavy but make thou it somewhat lighter for us thus shalt thou say unto them my little finger shall be thicker than my fathers loins 1011 for whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you i will put more to your yoke my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions 1012 so jeroboam and all the people came to rehoboam on the third day as the king bade saying come again to me on the third day 1013 and the king answered them roughly and king rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men 1014 and answered them after the advice of the young men saying my father made your yoke heavy but i will add thereto my father chastised you with whips but i will chastise you with scorpions 1015 so the king hearkened not unto the people for the cause was of god that the lord might perform his word which he spake by the hand of ahijah the shilonite to jeroboam the son of nebat 1016 and when all israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them the people answered the king saying what portion have we in david and we have none inheritance in the son of jesse every man to your tents o israel and now david see to thine own house so all israel went to their tents 1017 but as for the children of israel that dwelt in the cities of judah rehoboam reigned over them 1018 then king rehoboam sent hadoram that was over the tribute and the children of israel stoned him with stones that he died but king rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot to flee to jerusalem 1019 and israel rebelled against the house of david unto this day 111 and when rehoboam was come to jerusalem he gathered of the house of judah and benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men which were warriors to fight against israel that he might bring the kingdom again to rehoboam 112 but the word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god saying 113 speak unto rehoboam the son of solomon king of judah and to all israel in judah and benjamin saying 114 thus saith the lord ye shall not go up nor fight against your brethren return every man to his house for this thing is done of me and they obeyed the words of the lord and returned from going against jeroboam 115 and rehoboam dwelt in jerusalem and built cities for defence in judah 116 he built even bethlehem and etam and tekoa 117 and bethzur and shoco and adullam 118 and gath and mareshah and ziph 119 and adoraim and lachish and azekah 1110 and zorah and aijalon and hebron which are in judah and in benjamin fenced cities 1111 and he fortified the strong holds and put captains in them and store of victual and of oil and wine 1112 and in every several city he put shields and spears and made them exceeding strong having judah and benjamin on his side 1113 and the priests and the levites that were in all israel resorted to him out of all their coasts 1114 for the levites left their suburbs and their possession and came to judah and jerusalem for jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priests office unto the lord 1115 and he ordained him priests for the high places and for the devils and for the calves which he had made 1116 and after them out of all the tribes of israel such as set their hearts to seek the lord god of israel came to jerusalem to sacrifice unto the lord god of their fathers 1117 so they strengthened the kingdom of judah and made rehoboam the son of solomon strong three years for three years they walked in the way of david and solomon 1118 and rehoboam took him mahalath the daughter of jerimoth the son of david to wife and abihail the daughter of eliab the son of jesse 1119 which bare him children jeush and shamariah and zaham 1120 and after her he took maachah the daughter of absalom which bare him abijah and attai and ziza and shelomith 1121 and rehoboam loved maachah the daughter of absalom above all his wives and his concubines for he took eighteen wives and threescore concubines and begat twenty and eight sons and threescore daughters 1122 and rehoboam made abijah the son of maachah the chief to be ruler among his brethren for he thought to make him king 1123 and he dealt wisely and dispersed of all his children throughout all the countries of judah and benjamin unto every fenced city and he gave them victual in abundance and he desired many wives 121 and it came to pass when rehoboam had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself he forsook the law of the lord and all israel with him 122 and it came to pass that in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem because they had transgressed against the lord 123 with twelve hundred chariots and threescore thousand horsemen and the people were without number that came with him out of egypt the lubims the sukkiims and the ethiopians 124 and he took the fenced cities which pertained to judah and came to jerusalem 125 then came shemaiah the prophet to rehoboam and to the princes of judah that were gathered together to jerusalem because of shishak and said unto them thus saith the lord ye have forsaken me and therefore have i also left you in the hand of shishak 126 whereupon the princes of israel and the king humbled themselves and they said the lord is righteous 127 and when the lord saw that they humbled themselves the word of the lord came to shemaiah saying they have humbled themselves therefore i will not destroy them but i will grant them some deliverance and my wrath shall not be poured out upon jerusalem by the hand of shishak 128 nevertheless they shall be his servants that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries 129 so shishak king of egypt came up against jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the kings house he took all he carried away also the shields of gold which solomon had made 1210 instead of which king rehoboam made shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard that kept the entrance of the kings house 1211 and when the king entered into the house of the lord the guard came and fetched them and brought them again into the guard chamber 1212 and when he humbled himself the wrath of the lord turned from him that he would not destroy him altogether and also in judah things went well 1213 so king rehoboam strengthened himself in jerusalem and reigned for rehoboam was one and forty years old when he began to reign and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city which the lord had chosen out of all the tribes of israel to put his name there and his mothers name was naamah an ammonitess 1214 and he did evil because he prepared not his heart to seek the lord 1215 now the acts of rehoboam first and last are they not written in the book of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer concerning genealogies and there were wars between rehoboam and jeroboam continually 1216 and rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of david and abijah his son reigned in his stead 131 now in the eighteenth year of king jeroboam began abijah to reign over judah 132 he reigned three years in jerusalem his mothers name also was michaiah the daughter of uriel of gibeah and there was war between abijah and jeroboam 133 and abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men of war even four hundred thousand chosen men jeroboam also set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men being mighty men of valour 134 and abijah stood up upon mount zemaraim which is in mount ephraim and said hear me thou jeroboam and all israel 135 ought ye not to know that the lord god of israel gave the kingdom over israel to david for ever even to him and to his sons by a covenant of salt 136 yet jeroboam the son of nebat the servant of solomon the son of david is risen up and hath rebelled against his lord 137 and there are gathered unto him vain men the children of belial and have strengthened themselves against rehoboam the son of solomon when rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them 138 and now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the lord in the hand of the sons of david and ye be a great multitude and there are with your golden calves which jeroboam made you for gods 139 have ye not cast out the priests of the lord the sons of aaron and the levites and have made you priests after the manner of the nations of other lands so that whosoever cometh to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams the same may be a priest of them that are no gods 1310 but as for us the lord is our god and we have not forsaken him and the priests which minister unto the lord are the sons of aaron and the levites wait upon their business 1311 and they burn unto the lord every morning and every evening burnt sacrifices and sweet incense the shewbread also set they in order upon the pure table and the candlestick of gold with the lamps thereof to burn every evening for we keep the charge of the lord our god but ye have forsaken him 1312 and behold god himself is with us for our captain and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you o children of israel fight ye not against the lord god of your fathers for ye shall not prosper 1313 but jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them so they were before judah and the ambushment was behind them 1314 and when judah looked back behold the battle was before and behind and they cried unto the lord and the priests sounded with the trumpets 1315 then the men of judah gave a shout and as the men of judah shouted it came to pass that god smote jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah 1316 and the children of israel fled before judah and god delivered them into their hand 1317 and abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter so there fell down slain of israel five hundred thousand chosen men 1318 thus the children of israel were brought under at that time and the children of judah prevailed because they relied upon the lord god of their fathers 1319 and abijah pursued after jeroboam and took cities from him bethel with the towns thereof and jeshanah with the towns thereof and ephraim with the towns thereof 1320 neither did jeroboam recover strength again in the days of abijah and the lord struck him and he died 1321 but abijah waxed mighty and married fourteen wives and begat twenty and two sons and sixteen daughters 1322 and the rest of the acts of abijah and his ways and his sayings are written in the story of the prophet iddo 141 so abijah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and asa his son reigned in his stead in his days the land was quiet ten years 142 and asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the lord his god 143 for he took away the altars of the strange gods and the high places and brake down the images and cut down the groves 144 and commanded judah to seek the lord god of their fathers and to do the law and the commandment 145 also he took away out of all the cities of judah the high places and the images and the kingdom was quiet before him 146 and he built fenced cities in judah for the land had rest and he had no war in those years because the lord had given him rest 147 therefore he said unto judah let us build these cities and make about them walls and towers gates and bars while the land is yet before us because we have sought the lord our god we have sought him and he hath given us rest on every side so they built and prospered 148 and asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears out of judah three hundred thousand and out of benjamin that bare shields and drew bows two hundred and fourscore thousand all these were mighty men of valour 149 and there came out against them zerah the ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came unto mareshah 1410 then asa went out against him and they set the battle in array in the valley of zephathah at mareshah 1411 and asa cried unto the lord his god and said lord it is nothing with thee to help whether with many or with them that have no power help us o lord our god for we rest on thee and in thy name we go against this multitude o lord thou art our god let no man prevail against thee 1412 so the lord smote the ethiopians before asa and before judah and the ethiopians fled 1413 and asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto gerar and the ethiopians were overthrown that they could not recover themselves for they were destroyed before the lord and before his host and they carried away very much spoil 1414 and they smote all the cities round about gerar for the fear of the lord came upon them and they spoiled all the cities for there was exceeding much spoil in them 1415 they smote also the tents of cattle and carried away sheep and camels in abundance and returned to jerusalem 151 and the spirit of god came upon azariah the son of oded 152 and he went out to meet asa and said unto him hear ye me asa and all judah and benjamin the lord is with you while ye be with him and if ye seek him he will be found of you but if ye forsake him he will forsake you 153 now for a long season israel hath been without the true god and without a teaching priest and without law 154 but when they in their trouble did turn unto the lord god of israel and sought him he was found of them 155 and in those times there was no peace to him that went out nor to him that came in but great vexations were upon all the inhabitants of the countries 156 and nation was destroyed of nation and city of city for god did vex them with all adversity 157 be ye strong therefore and let not your hands be weak for your work shall be rewarded 158 and when asa heard these words and the prophecy of oded the prophet he took courage and put away the abominable idols out of all the land of judah and benjamin and out of the cities which he had taken from mount ephraim and renewed the altar of the lord that was before the porch of the lord 159 and he gathered all judah and benjamin and the strangers with them out of ephraim and manasseh and out of simeon for they fell to him out of israel in abundance when they saw that the lord his god was with him 1510 so they gathered themselves together at jerusalem in the third month in the fifteenth year of the reign of asa 1511 and they offered unto the lord the same time of the spoil which they had brought seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep 1512 and they entered into a covenant to seek the lord god of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul 1513 that whosoever would not seek the lord god of israel should be put to death whether small or great whether man or woman 1514 and they sware unto the lord with a loud voice and with shouting and with trumpets and with cornets 1515 and all judah rejoiced at the oath for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire and he was found of them and the lord gave them rest round about 1516 and also concerning maachah the mother of asa the king he removed her from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove and asa cut down her idol and stamped it and burnt it at the brook kidron 1517 but the high places were not taken away out of israel nevertheless the heart of asa was perfect all his days 1518 and he brought into the house of god the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated silver and gold and vessels 1519 and there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of the reign of asa 161 in the six and thirtieth year of the reign of asa baasha king of israel came up against judah and built ramah to the intent that he might let none go out or come in to asa king of judah 162 then asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the house of the lord and of the kings house and sent to benhadad king of syria that dwelt at damascus saying 163 there is a league between me and thee as there was between my father and thy father behold i have sent thee silver and gold go break thy league with baasha king of israel that he may depart from me 164 and benhadad hearkened unto king asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of israel and they smote ijon and dan and abelmaim and all the store cities of naphtali 165 and it came to pass when baasha heard it that he left off building of ramah and let his work cease 166 then asa the king took all judah and they carried away the stones of ramah and the timber thereof wherewith baasha was building and he built therewith geba and mizpah 167 and at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and said unto him because thou hast relied on the king of syria and not relied on the lord thy god therefore is the host of the king of syria escaped out of thine hand 168 were not the ethiopians and the lubims a huge host with very many chariots and horsemen yet because thou didst rely on the lord he delivered them into thine hand 169 for the eyes of the lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him herein thou hast done foolishly therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars 1610 then asa was wroth with the seer and put him in a prison house for he was in a rage with him because of this thing and asa oppressed some of the people the same time 1611 and behold the acts of asa first and last lo they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel 1612 and asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased in his feet until his disease was exceeding great yet in his disease he sought not to the lord but to the physicians 1613 and asa slept with his fathers and died in the one and fortieth year of his reign 1614 and they buried him in his own sepulchres which he had made for himself in the city of david and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries art and they made a very great burning for him 171 and jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead and strengthened himself against israel 172 and he placed forces in all the fenced cities of judah and set garrisons in the land of judah and in the cities of ephraim which asa his father had taken 173 and the lord was with jehoshaphat because he walked in the first ways of his father david and sought not unto baalim 174 but sought to the lord god of his father and walked in his commandments and not after the doings of israel 175 therefore the lord stablished the kingdom in his hand and all judah brought to jehoshaphat presents and he had riches and honour in abundance 176 and his heart was lifted up in the ways of the lord moreover he took away the high places and groves out of judah 177 also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes even to benhail and to obadiah and to zechariah and to nethaneel and to michaiah to teach in the cities of judah 178 and with them he sent levites even shemaiah and nethaniah and zebadiah and asahel and shemiramoth and jehonathan and adonijah and tobijah and tobadonijah levites and with them elishama and jehoram priests 179 and they taught in judah and had the book of the law of the lord with them and went about throughout all the cities of judah and taught the people 1710 and the fear of the lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about judah so that they made no war against jehoshaphat 1711 also some of the philistines brought jehoshaphat presents and tribute silver and the arabians brought him flocks seven thousand and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred he goats 1712 and jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly and he built in judah castles and cities of store 1713 and he had much business in the cities of judah and the men of war mighty men of valour were in jerusalem 1714 and these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers of judah the captains of thousands adnah the chief and with him mighty men of valour three hundred thousand 1715 and next to him was jehohanan the captain and with him two hundred and fourscore thousand 1716 and next him was amasiah the son of zichri who willingly offered himself unto the lord and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valour 1717 and of benjamin eliada a mighty man of valour and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand 1718 and next him was jehozabad and with him an hundred and fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war 1719 these waited on the king beside those whom the king put in the fenced cities throughout all judah 181 now jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance and joined affinity with ahab 182 and after certain years he went down to ahab to samaria and ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that he had with him and persuaded him to go up with him to ramothgilead 183 and ahab king of israel said unto jehoshaphat king of judah wilt thou go with me to ramothgilead and he answered him i am as thou art and my people as thy people and we will be with thee in the war 184 and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel enquire i pray thee at the word of the lord to day 185 therefore the king of israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men and said unto them shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and they said go up for god will deliver it into the kings hand 186 but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we might enquire of him 187 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may enquire of the lord but i hate him for he never prophesied good unto me but always evil the same is micaiah the son of imla and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so 188 and the king of israel called for one of his officers and said fetch quickly micaiah the son of imla 189 and the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah sat either of them on his throne clothed in their robes and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them 1810 and zedekiah the son of chenaanah had made him horns of iron and said thus saith the lord with these thou shalt push syria until they be consumed 1811 and all the prophets prophesied so saying go up to ramothgilead and prosper for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king 1812 and the messenger that went to call micaiah spake to him saying behold the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent let thy word therefore i pray thee be like one of theirs and speak thou good 1813 and micaiah said as the lord liveth even what my god saith that will i speak 1814 and when he was come to the king the king said unto him micaiah shall we go to ramothgilead to battle or shall i forbear and he said go ye up and prosper and they shall be delivered into your hand 1815 and the king said to him how many times shall i adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the lord 1816 then he said i did see all israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep that have no shepherd and the lord said these have no master let them return therefore every man to his house in peace 1817 and the king of israel said to jehoshaphat did i not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me but evil 1818 again he said therefore hear the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting upon his throne and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left 1819 and the lord said who shall entice ahab king of israel that he may go up and fall at ramothgilead and one spake saying after this manner and another saying after that manner 1820 then there came out a spirit and stood before the lord and said i will entice him and the lord said unto him wherewith 1821 and he said i will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets and the lord said thou shalt entice him and thou shalt also prevail go out and do even so 1822 now therefore behold the lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets and the lord hath spoken evil against thee 1823 then zedekiah the son of chenaanah came near and smote micaiah upon the cheek and said which way went the spirit of the lord from me to speak unto thee 1824 and micaiah said behold thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself 1825 then the king of israel said take ye micaiah and carry him back to amon the governor of the city and to joash the kings son 1826 and say thus saith the king put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until i return in peace 1827 and micaiah said if thou certainly return in peace then hath not the lord spoken by me and he said hearken all ye people 1828 so the king of israel and jehoshaphat the king of judah went up to ramothgilead 1829 and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and i will go to the battle but put thou on thy robes so the king of israel disguised himself and they went to the battle 1830 now the king of syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him saying fight ye not with small or great save only with the king of israel 1831 and it came to pass when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat that they said it is the king of israel therefore they compassed about him to fight but jehoshaphat cried out and the lord helped him and god moved them to depart from him 1832 for it came to pass that when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of israel they turned back again from pursuing him 1833 and a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote the king of israel between the joints of the harness therefore he said to his chariot man turn thine hand that thou mayest carry me out of the host for i am wounded 1834 and the battle increased that day howbeit the king of israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the syrians until the even and about the time of the sun going down he died 191 and jehoshaphat the king of judah returned to his house in peace to jerusalem 192 and jehu the son of hanani the seer went out to meet him and said to king jehoshaphat shouldest thou help the ungodly and love them that hate the lord therefore is wrath upon thee from before the lord 193 nevertheless there are good things found in thee in that thou hast taken away the groves out of the land and hast prepared thine heart to seek god 194 and jehoshaphat dwelt at jerusalem and he went out again through the people from beersheba to mount ephraim and brought them back unto the lord god of their fathers 195 and he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of judah city by city 196 and said to the judges take heed what ye do for ye judge not for man but for the lord who is with you in the judgment 197 wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with the lord our god nor respect of persons nor taking of gifts 198 moreover in jerusalem did jehoshaphat set of the levites and of the priests and of the chief of the fathers of israel for the judgment of the lord and for controversies when they returned to jerusalem 199 and he charged them saying thus shall ye do in the fear of the lord faithfully and with a perfect heart 1910 and what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in your cities between blood and blood between law and commandment statutes and judgments ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against the lord and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren this do and ye shall not trespass 1911 and behold amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the lord and zebadiah the son of ishmael the ruler of the house of judah for all the kings matters also the levites shall be officers before you deal courageously and the lord shall be with the good 201 it came to pass after this also that the children of moab and the children of ammon and with them other beside the ammonites came against jehoshaphat to battle 202 then there came some that told jehoshaphat saying there cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side syria and behold they be in hazazontamar which is engedi 203 and jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord and proclaimed a fast throughout all judah 204 and judah gathered themselves together to ask help of the lord even out of all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord 205 and jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of judah and jerusalem in the house of the lord before the new court 206 and said o lord god of our fathers art not thou god in heaven and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen and in thine hand is there not power and might so that none is able to withstand thee 207 art not thou our god who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel and gavest it to the seed of abraham thy friend for ever 208 and they dwelt therein and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name saying 209 if when evil cometh upon us as the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we stand before this house and in thy presence for thy name is in this house and cry unto thee in our affliction then thou wilt hear and help 2010 and now behold the children of ammon and moab and mount seir whom thou wouldest not let israel invade when they came out of the land of egypt but they turned from them and destroyed them not 2011 behold i say how they reward us to come to cast us out of thy possession which thou hast given us to inherit 2012 o our god wilt thou not judge them for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us neither know we what to do but our eyes are upon thee 2013 and all judah stood before the lord with their little ones their wives and their children 2014 then upon jahaziel the son of zechariah the son of benaiah the son of jeiel the son of mattaniah a levite of the sons of asaph came the spirit of the lord in the midst of the congregation 2015 and he said hearken ye all judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem and thou king jehoshaphat thus saith the lord unto you be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods 2016 to morrow go ye down against them behold they come up by the cliff of ziz and ye shall find them at the end of the brook before the wilderness of jeruel 2017 ye shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand ye still and see the salvation of the lord with you o judah and jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed to morrow go out against them for the lord will be with you 2018 and jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell before the lord worshipping the lord 2019 and the levites of the children of the kohathites and of the children of the korhites stood up to praise the lord god of israel with a loud voice on high 2020 and they rose early in the morning and went forth into the wilderness of tekoa and as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and said hear me o judah and ye inhabitants of jerusalem believe in the lord your god so shall ye be established believe his prophets so shall ye prosper 2021 and when he had consulted with the people he appointed singers unto the lord and that should praise the beauty of holiness as they went out before the army and to say praise the lord for his mercy endureth for ever 2022 and when they began to sing and to praise the lord set ambushments against the children of ammon moab and mount seir which were come against judah and they were smitten 2023 for the children of ammon and moab stood up against the inhabitants of mount seir utterly to slay and destroy them and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of seir every one helped to destroy another 2024 and when judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness they looked unto the multitude and behold they were dead bodies fallen to the earth and none escaped 2025 and when jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies and precious jewels which they stripped off for themselves more than they could carry away and they were three days in gathering of the spoil it was so much 2026 and on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of berachah for there they blessed the lord therefore the name of the same place was called the valley of berachah unto this day 2027 then they returned every man of judah and jerusalem and jehoshaphat in the forefront of them to go again to jerusalem with joy for the lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies 2028 and they came to jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the lord 2029 and the fear of god was on all the kingdoms of those countries when they had heard that the lord fought against the enemies of israel 2030 so the realm of jehoshaphat was quiet for his god gave him rest round about 2031 and jehoshaphat reigned over judah he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and five years in jerusalem and his mothers name was azubah the daughter of shilhi 2032 and he walked in the way of asa his father and departed not from it doing that which was right in the sight of the lord 2033 howbeit the high places were not taken away for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the god of their fathers 2034 now the rest of the acts of jehoshaphat first and last behold they are written in the book of jehu the son of hanani who is mentioned in the book of the kings of israel 2035 and after this did jehoshaphat king of judah join himself with ahaziah king of israel who did very wickedly 2036 and he joined himself with him to make ships to go to tarshish and they made the ships in eziongaber 2037 then eliezer the son of dodavah of mareshah prophesied against jehoshaphat saying because thou hast joined thyself with ahaziah the lord hath broken thy works and the ships were broken that they were not able to go to tarshish 211 now jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and jehoram his son reigned in his stead 212 and he had brethren the sons of jehoshaphat azariah and jehiel and zechariah and azariah and michael and shephatiah all these were the sons of jehoshaphat king of israel 213 and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things with fenced cities in judah but the kingdom gave he to jehoram because he was the firstborn 214 now when jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father he strengthened himself and slew all his brethren with the sword and divers also of the princes of israel 215 jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign and he reigned eight years in jerusalem 216 and he walked in the way of the kings of israel like as did the house of ahab for he had the daughter of ahab to wife and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the lord 217 howbeit the lord would not destroy the house of david because of the covenant that he had made with david and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever 218 in his days the edomites revolted from under the dominion of judah and made themselves a king 219 then jehoram went forth with his princes and all his chariots with him and he rose up by night and smote the edomites which compassed him in and the captains of the chariots 2110 so the edomites revolted from under the hand of judah unto this day the same time also did libnah revolt from under his hand because he had forsaken the lord god of his fathers 2111 moreover he made high places in the mountains of judah and caused the inhabitants of jerusalem to commit fornication and compelled judah thereto 2112 and there came a writing to him from elijah the prophet saying thus saith the lord god of david thy father because thou hast not walked in the ways of jehoshaphat thy father nor in the ways of asa king of judah 2113 but hast walked in the way of the kings of israel and hast made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to go a whoring like to the whoredoms of the house of ahab and also hast slain thy brethren of thy fathers house which were better than thyself 2114 behold with a great plague will the lord smite thy people and thy children and thy wives and all thy goods 2115 and thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day 2116 moreover the lord stirred up against jehoram the spirit of the philistines and of the arabians that were near the ethiopians 2117 and they came up into judah and brake into it and carried away all the substance that was found in the kings house and his sons also and his wives so that there was never a son left him save jehoahaz the youngest of his sons 2118 and after all this the lord smote him in his bowels with an incurable disease 2119 and it came to pass that in process of time after the end of two years his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness so he died of sore diseases and his people made no burning for him like the burning of his fathers 2120 thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem eight years and departed without being desired howbeit they buried him in the city of david but not in the sepulchres of the kings 221 and the inhabitants of jerusalem made ahaziah his youngest son king in his stead for the band of men that came with the arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest so ahaziah the son of jehoram king of judah reigned 222 forty and two years old was ahaziah when he began to reign and he reigned one year in jerusalem his mothers name also was athaliah the daughter of omri 223 he also walked in the ways of the house of ahab for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly 224 wherefore he did evil in the sight of the lord like the house of ahab for they were his counsellors after the death of his father to his destruction 225 he walked also after their counsel and went with jehoram the son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of syria at ramothgilead and the syrians smote joram 226 and he returned to be healed in jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at ramah when he fought with hazael king of syria and azariah the son of jehoram king of judah went down to see jehoram the son of ahab at jezreel because he was sick 227 and the destruction of ahaziah was of god by coming to joram for when he was come he went out with jehoram against jehu the son of nimshi whom the lord had anointed to cut off the house of ahab 228 and it came to pass that when jehu was executing judgment upon the house of ahab and found the princes of judah and the sons of the brethren of ahaziah that ministered to ahaziah he slew them 229 and he sought ahaziah and they caught him for he was hid in samaria and brought him to jehu and when they had slain him they buried him because said they he is the son of jehoshaphat who sought the lord with all his heart so the house of ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom 2210 but when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house of judah 2211 but jehoshabeath the daughter of the king took joash the son of ahaziah and stole him from among the kings sons that were slain and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber so jehoshabeath the daughter of king jehoram the wife of jehoiada the priest for she was the sister of ahaziah hid him from athaliah so that she slew him not 2212 and he was with them hid in the house of god six years and athaliah reigned over the land 231 and in the seventh year jehoiada strengthened himself and took the captains of hundreds azariah the son of jeroham and ishmael the son of jehohanan and azariah the son of obed and maaseiah the son of adaiah and elishaphat the son of zichri into covenant with him 232 and they went about in judah and gathered the levites out of all the cities of judah and the chief of the fathers of israel and they came to jerusalem 233 and all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of god and he said unto them behold the kings son shall reign as the lord hath said of the sons of david 234 this is the thing that ye shall do a third part of you entering on the sabbath of the priests and of the levites shall be porters of the doors 235 and a third part shall be at the kings house and a third part at the gate of the foundation and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the lord 236 but let none come into the house of the lord save the priests and they that minister of the levites they shall go in for they are holy but all the people shall keep the watch of the lord 237 and the levites shall compass the king round about every man with his weapons in his hand and whosoever else cometh into the house he shall be put to death but be ye with the king when he cometh in and when he goeth out 238 so the levites and all judah did according to all things that jehoiada the priest had commanded and took every man his men that were to come in on the sabbath with them that were to go out on the sabbath for jehoiada the priest dismissed not the courses 239 moreover jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of hundreds spears and bucklers and shields that had been king davids which were in the house of god 2310 and he set all the people every man having his weapon in his hand from the right side of the temple to the left side of the temple along by the altar and the temple by the king round about 2311 then they brought out the kings son and put upon him the crown and gave him the testimony and made him king and jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said god save the king 2312 now when athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king she came to the people into the house of the lord 2313 and she looked and behold the king stood at his pillar at the entering in and the princes and the trumpets by the king and all the people of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets also the singers with instruments of musick and such as taught to sing praise then athaliah rent her clothes and said treason treason 2314 then jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host and said unto them have her forth of the ranges and whoso followeth her let him be slain with the sword for the priest said slay her not in the house of the lord 2315 so they laid hands on her and when she was come to the entering of the horse gate by the kings house they slew her there 2316 and jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all the people and between the king that they should be the lords people 2317 then all the people went to the house of baal and brake it down and brake his altars and his images in pieces and slew mattan the priest of baal before the altars 2318 also jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the lord by the hand of the priests the levites whom david had distributed in the house of the lord to offer the burnt offerings of the lord as it is written in the law of moses with rejoicing and with singing as it was ordained by david 2319 and he set the porters at the gates of the house of the lord that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in 2320 and he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and the governors of the people and all the people of the land and brought down the king from the house of the lord and they came through the high gate into the kings house and set the king upon the throne of the kingdom 2321 and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet after that they had slain athaliah with the sword 241 joash was seven years old when he began to reign and he reigned forty years in jerusalem his mothers name also was zibiah of beersheba 242 and joash did that which was right in the sight of the lord all the days of jehoiada the priest 243 and jehoiada took for him two wives and he begat sons and daughters 244 and it came to pass after this that joash was minded to repair the house of the lord 245 and he gathered together the priests and the levites and said to them go out unto the cities of judah and gather of all israel money to repair the house of your god from year to year and see that ye hasten the matter howbeit the levites hastened it not 246 and the king called for jehoiada the chief and said unto him why hast thou not required of the levites to bring in out of judah and out of jerusalem the collection according to the commandment of moses the servant of the lord and of the congregation of israel for the tabernacle of witness 247 for the sons of athaliah that wicked woman had broken up the house of god and also all the dedicated things of the house of the lord did they bestow upon baalim 248 and at the kings commandment they made a chest and set it without at the gate of the house of the lord 249 and they made a proclamation through judah and jerusalem to bring in to the lord the collection that moses the servant of god laid upon israel in the wilderness 2410 and all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in and cast into the chest until they had made an end 2411 now it came to pass that at what time the chest was brought unto the kings office by the hand of the levites and when they saw that there was much money the kings scribe and the high priests officer came and emptied the chest and took it and carried it to his place again thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance 2412 and the king and jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of the service of the house of the lord and hired masons and carpenters to repair the house of the lord and also such as wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the lord 2413 so the workmen wrought and the work was perfected by them and they set the house of god in his state and strengthened it 2414 and when they had finished it they brought the rest of the money before the king and jehoiada whereof were made vessels for the house of the lord even vessels to minister and to offer withal and spoons and vessels of gold and silver and they offered burnt offerings in the house of the lord continually all the days of jehoiada 2415 but jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died an hundred and thirty years old was he when he died 2416 and they buried him in the city of david among the kings because he had done good in israel both toward god and toward his house 2417 now after the death of jehoiada came the princes of judah and made obeisance to the king then the king hearkened unto them 2418 and they left the house of the lord god of their fathers and served groves and idols and wrath came upon judah and jerusalem for this their trespass 2419 yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the lord and they testified against them but they would not give ear 2420 and the spirit of god came upon zechariah the son of jehoiada the priest which stood above the people and said unto them thus saith god why transgress ye the commandments of the lord that ye cannot prosper because ye have forsaken the lord he hath also forsaken you 2421 and they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the lord 2422 thus joash the king remembered not the kindness which jehoiada his father had done to him but slew his son and when he died he said the lord look upon it and require it 2423 and it came to pass at the end of the year that the host of syria came up against him and they came to judah and jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of damascus 2424 for the army of the syrians came with a small company of men and the lord delivered a very great host into their hand because they had forsaken the lord god of their fathers so they executed judgment against joash 2425 and when they were departed from him for they left him in great diseases his own servants conspired against him for the blood of the sons of jehoiada the priest and slew him on his bed and he died and they buried him in the city of david but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings 2426 and these are they that conspired against him zabad the son of shimeath an ammonitess and jehozabad the son of shimrith a moabitess 2427 now concerning his sons and the greatness of the burdens laid upon him and the repairing of the house of god behold they are written in the story of the book of the kings and amaziah his son reigned in his stead 251 amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in jerusalem and his mothers name was jehoaddan of jerusalem 252 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord but not with a perfect heart 253 now it came to pass when the kingdom was established to him that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father 254 but he slew not their children but did as it is written in the law in the book of moses where the lord commanded saying the fathers shall not die for the children neither shall the children die for the fathers but every man shall die for his own sin 255 moreover amaziah gathered judah together and made them captains over thousands and captains over hundreds according to the houses of their fathers throughout all judah and benjamin and he numbered them from twenty years old and above and found them three hundred thousand choice men able to go forth to war that could handle spear and shield 256 he hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of israel for an hundred talents of silver 257 but there came a man of god to him saying o king let not the army of israel go with thee for the lord is not with israel to wit with all the children of ephraim 258 but if thou wilt go do it be strong for the battle god shall make thee fall before the enemy for god hath power to help and to cast down 259 and amaziah said to the man of god but what shall we do for the hundred talents which i have given to the army of israel and the man of god answered the lord is able to give thee much more than this 2510 then amaziah separated them to wit the army that was come to him out of ephraim to go home again wherefore their anger was greatly kindled against judah and they returned home in great anger 2511 and amaziah strengthened himself and led forth his people and went to the valley of salt and smote of the children of seir ten thousand 2512 and other ten thousand left alive did the children of judah carry away captive and brought them unto the top of the rock and cast them down from the top of the rock that they all were broken in pieces 2513 but the soldiers of the army which amaziah sent back that they should not go with him to battle fell upon the cities of judah from samaria even unto bethhoron and smote three thousand of them and took much spoil 2514 now it came to pass after that amaziah was come from the slaughter of the edomites that he brought the gods of the children of seir and set them up to be his gods and bowed down himself before them and burned incense unto them 2515 wherefore the anger of the lord was kindled against amaziah and he sent unto him a prophet which said unto him why hast thou sought after the gods of the people which could not deliver their own people out of thine hand 2516 and it came to pass as he talked with him that the king said unto him art thou made of the kings counsel forbear why shouldest thou be smitten then the prophet forbare and said i know that god hath determined to destroy thee because thou hast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counsel 2517 then amaziah king of judah took advice and sent to joash the son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel saying come let us see one another in the face 2518 and joash king of israel sent to amaziah king of judah saying the thistle that was in lebanon sent to the cedar that was in lebanon saying give thy daughter to my son to wife and there passed by a wild beast that was in lebanon and trode down the thistle 2519 thou sayest lo thou hast smitten the edomites and thine heart lifteth thee up to boast abide now at home why shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt that thou shouldest fall even thou and judah with thee 2520 but amaziah would not hear for it came of god that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies because they sought after the gods of edom 2521 so joash the king of israel went up and they saw one another in the face both he and amaziah king of judah at bethshemesh which belongeth to judah 2522 and judah was put to the worse before israel and they fled every man to his tent 2523 and joash the king of israel took amaziah king of judah the son of joash the son of jehoahaz at bethshemesh and brought him to jerusalem and brake down the wall of jerusalem from the gate of ephraim to the corner gate four hundred cubits 2524 and he took all the gold and the silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of god with obededom and the treasures of the kings house the hostages also and returned to samaria 2525 and amaziah the son of joash king of judah lived after the death of joash son of jehoahaz king of israel fifteen years 2526 now the rest of the acts of amaziah first and last behold are they not written in the book of the kings of judah and israel 2527 now after the time that amaziah did turn away from following the lord they made a conspiracy against him in jerusalem and he fled to lachish but they sent to lachish after him and slew him there 2528 and they brought him upon horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of judah 261 then all the people of judah took uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king in the room of his father amaziah 262 he built eloth and restored it to judah after that the king slept with his fathers 263 sixteen years old was uzziah when he began to reign and he reigned fifty and two years in jerusalem his mothers name also was jecoliah of jerusalem 264 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that his father amaziah did 265 and he sought god in the days of zechariah who had understanding in the visions of god and as long as he sought the lord god made him to prosper 266 and he went forth and warred against the philistines and brake down the wall of gath and the wall of jabneh and the wall of ashdod and built cities about ashdod and among the philistines 267 and god helped him against the philistines and against the arabians that dwelt in gurbaal and the mehunims 268 and the ammonites gave gifts to uzziah and his name spread abroad even to the entering in of egypt for he strengthened himself exceedingly 269 moreover uzziah built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate and at the valley gate and at the turning of the wall and fortified them 2610 also he built towers in the desert and digged many wells for he had much cattle both in the low country and in the plains husbandmen also and vine dressers in the mountains and in carmel for he loved husbandry 2611 moreover uzziah had an host of fighting men that went out to war by bands according to the number of their account by the hand of jeiel the scribe and maaseiah the ruler under the hand of hananiah one of the kings captains 2612 the whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand and six hundred 2613 and under their hand was an army three hundred thousand and seven thousand and five hundred that made war with mighty power to help the king against the enemy 2614 and uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields and spears and helmets and habergeons and bows and slings to cast stones 2615 and he made in jerusalem engines invented by cunning men to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks to shoot arrows and great stones withal and his name spread far abroad for he was marvellously helped till he was strong 2616 but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction for he transgressed against the lord his god and went into the temple of the lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense 2617 and azariah the priest went in after him and with him fourscore priests of the lord that were valiant men 2618 and they withstood uzziah the king and said unto him it appertaineth not unto thee uzziah to burn incense unto the lord but to the priests the sons of aaron that are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary for thou hast trespassed neither shall it be for thine honour from the lord god 2619 then uzziah was wroth and had a censer in his hand to burn incense and while he was wroth with the priests the leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the lord from beside the incense altar 2620 and azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him out from thence yea himself hasted also to go out because the lord had smitten him 2621 and uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death and dwelt in a several house being a leper for he was cut off from the house of the lord and jotham his son was over the kings house judging the people of the land 2622 now the rest of the acts of uzziah first and last did isaiah the prophet the son of amoz write 2623 so uzziah slept with his fathers and they buried him with his fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings for they said he is a leper and jotham his son reigned in his stead 271 jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem his mothers name also was jerushah the daughter of zadok 272 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that his father uzziah did howbeit he entered not into the temple of the lord and the people did yet corruptly 273 he built the high gate of the house of the lord and on the wall of ophel he built much 274 moreover he built cities in the mountains of judah and in the forests he built castles and towers 275 he fought also with the king of the ammonites and prevailed against them and the children of ammon gave him the same year an hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten thousand of barley so much did the children of ammon pay unto him both the second year and the third 276 so jotham became mighty because he prepared his ways before the lord his god 277 now the rest of the acts of jotham and all his wars and his ways lo they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah 278 he was five and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in jerusalem 279 and jotham slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city of david and ahaz his son reigned in his stead 281 ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned sixteen years in jerusalem but he did not that which was right in the sight of the lord like david his father 282 for he walked in the ways of the kings of israel and made also molten images for baalim 283 moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of hinnom and burnt his children in the fire after the abominations of the heathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel 284 he sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree 285 wherefore the lord his god delivered him into the hand of the king of syria and they smote him and carried away a great multitude of them captives and brought them to damascus and he was also delivered into the hand of the king of israel who smote him with a great slaughter 286 for pekah the son of remaliah slew in judah an hundred and twenty thousand in one day which were all valiant men because they had forsaken the lord god of their fathers 287 and zichri a mighty man of ephraim slew maaseiah the kings son and azrikam the governor of the house and elkanah that was next to the king 288 and the children of israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand women sons and daughters and took also away much spoil from them and brought the spoil to samaria 289 but a prophet of the lord was there whose name was oded and he went out before the host that came to samaria and said unto them behold because the lord god of your fathers was wroth with judah he hath delivered them into your hand and ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven 2810 and now ye purpose to keep under the children of judah and jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you but are there not with you even with you sins against the lord your god 2811 now hear me therefore and deliver the captives again which ye have taken captive of your brethren for the fierce wrath of the lord is upon you 2812 then certain of the heads of the children of ephraim azariah the son of johanan berechiah the son of meshillemoth and jehizkiah the son of shallum and amasa the son of hadlai stood up against them that came from the war 2813 and said unto them ye shall not bring in the captives hither for whereas we have offended against the lord already ye intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass for our trespass is great and there is fierce wrath against israel 2814 so the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation 2815 and the men which were expressed by name rose up and took the captives and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among them and arrayed them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink and anointed them and carried all the feeble of them upon asses and brought them to jericho the city of palm trees to their brethren then they returned to samaria 2816 at that time did king ahaz send unto the kings of assyria to help him 2817 for again the edomites had come and smitten judah and carried away captives 2818 the philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country and of the south of judah and had taken bethshemesh and ajalon and gederoth and shocho with the villages thereof and timnah with the villages thereof gimzo also and the villages thereof and they dwelt there 2819 for the lord brought judah low because of ahaz king of israel for he made judah naked and transgressed sore against the lord 2820 and tilgathpilneser king of assyria came unto him and distressed him but strengthened him not 2821 for ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the lord and out of the house of the king and of the princes and gave it unto the king of assyria but he helped him not 2822 and in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more against the lord this is that king ahaz 2823 for he sacrificed unto the gods of damascus which smote him and he said because the gods of the kings of syria help them therefore will i sacrifice to them that they may help me but they were the ruin of him and of all israel 2824 and ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of god and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of god and shut up the doors of the house of the lord and he made him altars in every corner of jerusalem 2825 and in every several city of judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods and provoked to anger the lord god of his fathers 2826 now the rest of his acts and of all his ways first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel 2827 and ahaz slept with his fathers and they buried him in the city even in jerusalem but they brought him not into the sepulchres of the kings of israel and hezekiah his son reigned in his stead 291 hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old and he reigned nine and twenty years in jerusalem and his mothers name was abijah the daughter of zechariah 292 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord according to all that david his father had done 293 he in the first year of his reign in the first month opened the doors of the house of the lord and repaired them 294 and he brought in the priests and the levites and gathered them together into the east street 295 and said unto them hear me ye levites sanctify now yourselves and sanctify the house of the lord god of your fathers and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place 296 for our fathers have trespassed and done that which was evil in the eyes of the lord our god and have forsaken him and have turned away their faces from the habitation of the lord and turned their backs 297 also they have shut up the doors of the porch and put out the lamps and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place unto the god of israel 298 wherefore the wrath of the lord was upon judah and jerusalem and he hath delivered them to trouble to astonishment and to hissing as ye see with your eyes 299 for lo our fathers have fallen by the sword and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this 2910 now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the lord god of israel that his fierce wrath may turn away from us 2911 my sons be not now negligent for the lord hath chosen you to stand before him to serve him and that ye should minister unto him and burn incense 2912 then the levites arose mahath the son of amasai and joel the son of azariah of the sons of the kohathites and of the sons of merari kish the son of abdi and azariah the son of jehalelel and of the gershonites joah the son of zimmah and eden the son of joah 2913 and of the sons of elizaphan shimri and jeiel and of the sons of asaph zechariah and mattaniah 2914 and of the sons of heman jehiel and shimei and of the sons of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel 2915 and they gathered their brethren and sanctified themselves and came according to the commandment of the king by the words of the lord to cleanse the house of the lord 2916 and the priests went into the inner part of the house of the lord to cleanse it and brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of the lord into the court of the house of the lord and the levites took it to carry it out abroad into the brook kidron 2917 now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the lord so they sanctified the house of the lord in eight days and in the sixteenth day of the first month they made an end 2918 then they went in to hezekiah the king and said we have cleansed all the house of the lord and the altar of burnt offering with all the vessels thereof and the shewbread table with all the vessels thereof 2919 moreover all the vessels which king ahaz in his reign did cast away in his transgression have we prepared and sanctified and behold they are before the altar of the lord 2920 then hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the rulers of the city and went up to the house of the lord 2921 and they brought seven bullocks and seven rams and seven lambs and seven he goats for a sin offering for the kingdom and for the sanctuary and for judah and he commanded the priests the sons of aaron to offer them on the altar of the lord 2922 so they killed the bullocks and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar likewise when they had killed the rams they sprinkled the blood upon the altar they killed also the lambs and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar 2923 and they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation and they laid their hands upon them 2924 and the priests killed them and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar to make an atonement for all israel for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be made for all israel 2925 and he set the levites in the house of the lord with cymbals with psalteries and with harps according to the commandment of david and of gad the kings seer and nathan the prophet for so was the commandment of the lord by his prophets 2926 and the levites stood with the instruments of david and the priests with the trumpets 2927 and hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar and when the burnt offering began the song of the lord began also with the trumpets and with the instruments ordained by david king of israel 2928 and all the congregation worshipped and the singers sang and the trumpeters sounded and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished 2929 and when they had made an end of offering the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped 2930 moreover hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the levites to sing praise unto the lord with the words of david and of asaph the seer and they sang praises with gladness and they bowed their heads and worshipped 2931 then hezekiah answered and said now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the lord come near and bring sacrifices and thank offerings into the house of the lord and the congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings and as many as were of a free heart burnt offerings 2932 and the number of the burnt offerings which the congregation brought was threescore and ten bullocks an hundred rams and two hundred lambs all these were for a burnt offering to the lord 2933 and the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep 2934 but the priests were too few so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings wherefore their brethren the levites did help them till the work was ended and until the other priests had sanctified themselves for the levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests 2935 and also the burnt offerings were in abundance with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for every burnt offering so the service of the house of the lord was set in order 2936 and hezekiah rejoiced and all the people that god had prepared the people for the thing was done suddenly 301 and hezekiah sent to all israel and judah and wrote letters also to ephraim and manasseh that they should come to the house of the lord at jerusalem to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel 302 for the king had taken counsel and his princes and all the congregation in jerusalem to keep the passover in the second month 303 for they could not keep it at that time because the priests had not sanctified themselves sufficiently neither had the people gathered themselves together to jerusalem 304 and the thing pleased the king and all the congregation 305 so they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all israel from beersheba even to dan that they should come to keep the passover unto the lord god of israel at jerusalem for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was written 306 so the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes throughout all israel and judah and according to the commandment of the king saying ye children of israel turn again unto the lord god of abraham isaac and israel and he will return to the remnant of you that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of assyria 307 and be not ye like your fathers and like your brethren which trespassed against the lord god of their fathers who therefore gave them up to desolation as ye see 308 now be ye not stiffnecked as your fathers were but yield yourselves unto the lord and enter into his sanctuary which he hath sanctified for ever and serve the lord your god that the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you 309 for if ye turn again unto the lord your brethren and your children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive so that they shall come again into this land for the lord your god is gracious and merciful and will not turn away his face from you if ye return unto him 3010 so the posts passed from city to city through the country of ephraim and manasseh even unto zebulun but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them 3011 nevertheless divers of asher and manasseh and of zebulun humbled themselves and came to jerusalem 3012 also in judah the hand of god was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes by the word of the lord 3013 and there assembled at jerusalem much people to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month a very great congregation 3014 and they arose and took away the altars that were in jerusalem and all the altars for incense took they away and cast them into the brook kidron 3015 then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month and the priests and the levites were ashamed and sanctified themselves and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the lord 3016 and they stood in their place after their manner according to the law of moses the man of god the priests sprinkled the blood which they received of the hand of the levites 3017 for there were many in the congregation that were not sanctified therefore the levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean to sanctify them unto the lord 3018 for a multitude of the people even many of ephraim and manasseh issachar and zebulun had not cleansed themselves yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written but hezekiah prayed for them saying the good lord pardon every one 3019 that prepareth his heart to seek god the lord god of his fathers though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary 3020 and the lord hearkened to hezekiah and healed the people 3021 and the children of israel that were present at jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness and the levites and the priests praised the lord day by day singing with loud instruments unto the lord 3022 and hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the levites that taught the good knowledge of the lord and they did eat throughout the feast seven days offering peace offerings and making confession to the lord god of their fathers 3023 and the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days and they kept other seven days with gladness 3024 for hezekiah king of judah did give to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep and a great number of priests sanctified themselves 3025 and all the congregation of judah with the priests and the levites and all the congregation that came out of israel and the strangers that came out of the land of israel and that dwelt in judah rejoiced 3026 so there was great joy in jerusalem for since the time of solomon the son of david king of israel there was not the like in jerusalem 3027 then the priests the levites arose and blessed the people and their voice was heard and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling place even unto heaven 311 now when all this was finished all israel that were present went out to the cities of judah and brake the images in pieces and cut down the groves and threw down the high places and the altars out of all judah and benjamin in ephraim also and manasseh until they had utterly destroyed them all then all the children of israel returned every man to his possession into their own cities 312 and hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the levites after their courses every man according to his service the priests and levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the tents of the lord 313 he appointed also the kings portion of his substance for the burnt offerings to wit for the morning and evening burnt offerings and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the set feasts as it is written in the law of the lord 314 moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the levites that they might be encouraged in the law of the lord 315 and as soon as the commandment came abroad the children of israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn wine and oil and honey and of all the increase of the field and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly 316 and concerning the children of israel and judah that dwelt in the cities of judah they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the lord their god and laid them by heaps 317 in the third month they began to lay the foundation of the heaps and finished them in the seventh month 318 and when hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps they blessed the lord and his people israel 319 then hezekiah questioned with the priests and the levites concerning the heaps 3110 and azariah the chief priest of the house of zadok answered him and said since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the lord we have had enough to eat and have left plenty for the lord hath blessed his people and that which is left is this great store 3111 then hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the lord and they prepared them 3112 and brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully over which cononiah the levite was ruler and shimei his brother was the next 3113 and jehiel and azaziah and nahath and asahel and jerimoth and jozabad and eliel and ismachiah and mahath and benaiah were overseers under the hand of cononiah and shimei his brother at the commandment of hezekiah the king and azariah the ruler of the house of god 3114 and kore the son of imnah the levite the porter toward the east was over the freewill offerings of god to distribute the oblations of the lord and the most holy things 3115 and next him were eden and miniamin and jeshua and shemaiah amariah and shecaniah in the cities of the priests in their set office to give to their brethren by courses as well to the great as to the small 3116 beside their genealogy of males from three years old and upward even unto every one that entereth into the house of the lord his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses 3117 both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their fathers and the levites from twenty years old and upward in their charges by their courses 3118 and to the genealogy of all their little ones their wives and their sons and their daughters through all the congregation for in their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness 3119 also of the sons of aaron the priests which were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities in every several city the men that were expressed by name to give portions to all the males among the priests and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the levites 3120 and thus did hezekiah throughout all judah and wrought that which was good and right and truth before the lord his god 3121 and in every work that he began in the service of the house of god and in the law and in the commandments to seek his god he did it with all his heart and prospered 321 after these things and the establishment thereof sennacherib king of assyria came and entered into judah and encamped against the fenced cities and thought to win them for himself 322 and when hezekiah saw that sennacherib was come and that he was purposed to fight against jerusalem 323 he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city and they did help him 324 so there was gathered much people together who stopped all the fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land saying why should the kings of assyria come and find much water 325 also he strengthened himself and built up all the wall that was broken and raised it up to the towers and another wall without and repaired millo in the city of david and made darts and shields in abundance 326 and he set captains of war over the people and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city and spake comfortably to them saying 327 be strong and courageous be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of assyria nor for all the multitude that is with him for there be more with us than with him 328 with him is an arm of flesh but with us is the lord our god to help us and to fight our battles and the people rested themselves upon the words of hezekiah king of judah 329 after this did sennacherib king of assyria send his servants to jerusalem but he himself laid siege against lachish and all his power with him unto hezekiah king of judah and unto all judah that were at jerusalem saying 3210 thus saith sennacherib king of assyria whereon do ye trust that ye abide in the siege in jerusalem 3211 doth not hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst saying the lord our god shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of assyria 3212 hath not the same hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded judah and jerusalem saying ye shall worship before one altar and burn incense upon it 3213 know ye not what i and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand 3214 who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people out of mine hand that your god should be able to deliver you out of mine hand 3215 now therefore let not hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you on this manner neither yet believe him for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand and out of the hand of my fathers how much less shall your god deliver you out of mine hand 3216 and his servants spake yet more against the lord god and against his servant hezekiah 3217 he wrote also letters to rail on the lord god of israel and to speak against him saying as the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand so shall not the god of hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand 3218 then they cried with a loud voice in the jews speech unto the people of jerusalem that were on the wall to affright them and to trouble them that they might take the city 3219 and they spake against the god of jerusalem as against the gods of the people of the earth which were the work of the hands of man 3220 and for this cause hezekiah the king and the prophet isaiah the son of amoz prayed and cried to heaven 3221 and the lord sent an angel which cut off all the mighty men of valour and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of assyria so he returned with shame of face to his own land and when he was come into the house of his god they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword 3222 thus the lord saved hezekiah and the inhabitants of jerusalem from the hand of sennacherib the king of assyria and from the hand of all other and guided them on every side 3223 and many brought gifts unto the lord to jerusalem and presents to hezekiah king of judah so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth 3224 in those days hezekiah was sick to the death and prayed unto the lord and he spake unto him and he gave him a sign 3225 but hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him for his heart was lifted up therefore there was wrath upon him and upon judah and jerusalem 3226 notwithstanding hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart both he and the inhabitants of jerusalem so that the wrath of the lord came not upon them in the days of hezekiah 3227 and hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour and he made himself treasuries for silver and for gold and for precious stones and for spices and for shields and for all manner of pleasant jewels 3228 storehouses also for the increase of corn and wine and oil and stalls for all manner of beasts and cotes for flocks 3229 moreover he provided him cities and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance for god had given him substance very much 3230 this same hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of gihon and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of david and hezekiah prospered in all his works 3231 howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of babylon who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land god left him to try him that he might know all that was in his heart 3232 now the rest of the acts of hezekiah and his goodness behold they are written in the vision of isaiah the prophet the son of amoz and in the book of the kings of judah and israel 3233 and hezekiah slept with his fathers and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of david and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem did him honour at his death and manasseh his son reigned in his stead 331 manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and he reigned fifty and five years in jerusalem 332 but did that which was evil in the sight of the lord like unto the abominations of the heathen whom the lord had cast out before the children of israel 333 for he built again the high places which hezekiah his father had broken down and he reared up altars for baalim and made groves and worshipped all the host of heaven and served them 334 also he built altars in the house of the lord whereof the lord had said in jerusalem shall my name be for ever 335 and he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the lord 336 and he caused his children to pass through the fire in the valley of the son of hinnom also he observed times and used enchantments and used witchcraft and dealt with a familiar spirit and with wizards he wrought much evil in the sight of the lord to provoke him to anger 337 and he set a carved image the idol which he had made in the house of god of which god had said to david and to solomon his son in this house and in jerusalem which i have chosen before all the tribes of israel will i put my name for ever 338 neither will i any more remove the foot of israel from out of the land which i have appointed for your fathers so that they will take heed to do all that i have commanded them according to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the hand of moses 339 so manasseh made judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem to err and to do worse than the heathen whom the lord had destroyed before the children of israel 3310 and the lord spake to manasseh and to his people but they would not hearken 3311 wherefore the lord brought upon them the captains of the host of the king of assyria which took manasseh among the thorns and bound him with fetters and carried him to babylon 3312 and when he was in affliction he besought the lord his god and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers 3313 and prayed unto him and he was intreated of him and heard his supplication and brought him again to jerusalem into his kingdom then manasseh knew that the lord he was god 3314 now after this he built a wall without the city of david on the west side of gihon in the valley even to the entering in at the fish gate and compassed about ophel and raised it up a very great height and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of judah 3315 and he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the lord and all the altars that he had built in the mount of the house of the lord and in jerusalem and cast them out of the city 3316 and he repaired the altar of the lord and sacrificed thereon peace offerings and thank offerings and commanded judah to serve the lord god of israel 3317 nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high places yet unto the lord their god only 3318 now the rest of the acts of manasseh and his prayer unto his god and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name of the lord god of israel behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel 3319 his prayer also and how god was intreated of him and all his sins and his trespass and the places wherein he built high places and set up groves and graven images before he was humbled behold they are written among the sayings of the seers 3320 so manasseh slept with his fathers and they buried him in his own house and amon his son reigned in his stead 3321 amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned two years in jerusalem 3322 but he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord as did manasseh his father for amon sacrificed unto all the carved images which manasseh his father had made and served them 3323 and humbled not himself before the lord as manasseh his father had humbled himself but amon trespassed more and more 3324 and his servants conspired against him and slew him in his own house 3325 but the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king amon and the people of the land made josiah his son king in his stead 341 josiah was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned in jerusalem one and thirty years 342 and he did that which was right in the sight of the lord and walked in the ways of david his father and declined neither to the right hand nor to the left 343 for in the eighth year of his reign while he was yet young he began to seek after the god of david his father and in the twelfth year he began to purge judah and jerusalem from the high places and the groves and the carved images and the molten images 344 and they brake down the altars of baalim in his presence and the images that were on high above them he cut down and the groves and the carved images and the molten images he brake in pieces and made dust of them and strowed it upon the graves of them that had sacrificed unto them 345 and he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars and cleansed judah and jerusalem 346 and so did he in the cities of manasseh and ephraim and simeon even unto naphtali with their mattocks round about 347 and when he had broken down the altars and the groves and had beaten the graven images into powder and cut down all the idols throughout all the land of israel he returned to jerusalem 348 now in the eighteenth year of his reign when he had purged the land and the house he sent shaphan the son of azaliah and maaseiah the governor of the city and joah the son of joahaz the recorder to repair the house of the lord his god 349 and when they came to hilkiah the high priest they delivered the money that was brought into the house of god which the levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of manasseh and ephraim and of all the remnant of israel and of all judah and benjamin and they returned to jerusalem 3410 and they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the oversight of the house of the lord and they gave it to the workmen that wrought in the house of the lord to repair and amend the house 3411 even to the artificers and builders gave they it to buy hewn stone and timber for couplings and to floor the houses which the kings of judah had destroyed 3412 and the men did the work faithfully and the overseers of them were jahath and obadiah the levites of the sons of merari and zechariah and meshullam of the sons of the kohathites to set it forward and other of the levites all that could skill of instruments of musick 3413 also they were over the bearers of burdens and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service and of the levites there were scribes and officers and porters 3414 and when they brought out the money that was brought into the house of the lord hilkiah the priest found a book of the law of the lord given by moses 3415 and hilkiah answered and said to shaphan the scribe i have found the book of the law in the house of the lord and hilkiah delivered the book to shaphan 3416 and shaphan carried the book to the king and brought the king word back again saying all that was committed to thy servants they do it 3417 and they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the lord and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and to the hand of the workmen 3418 then shaphan the scribe told the king saying hilkiah the priest hath given me a book and shaphan read it before the king 3419 and it came to pass when the king had heard the words of the law that he rent his clothes 3420 and the king commanded hilkiah and ahikam the son of shaphan and abdon the son of micah and shaphan the scribe and asaiah a servant of the kings saying 3421 go enquire of the lord for me and for them that are left in israel and in judah concerning the words of the book that is found for great is the wrath of the lord that is poured out upon us because our fathers have not kept the word of the lord to do after all that is written in this book 3422 and hilkiah and they that the king had appointed went to huldah the prophetess the wife of shallum the son of tikvath the son of hasrah keeper of the wardrobe now she dwelt in jerusalem in the college and they spake to her to that effect 3423 and she answered them thus saith the lord god of israel tell ye the man that sent you to me 3424 thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon this place and upon the inhabitants thereof even all the curses that are written in the book which they have read before the king of judah 3425 because they have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands therefore my wrath shall be poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched 3426 and as for the king of judah who sent you to enquire of the lord so shall ye say unto him thus saith the lord god of israel concerning the words which thou hast heard 3427 because thine heart was tender and thou didst humble thyself before god when thou heardest his words against this place and against the inhabitants thereof and humbledst thyself before me and didst rend thy clothes and weep before me i have even heard thee also saith the lord 3428 behold i will gather thee to thy fathers and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that i will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of the same so they brought the king word again 3429 then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of judah and jerusalem 3430 and the king went up into the house of the lord and all the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and the priests and the levites and all the people great and small and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant that was found in the house of the lord 3431 and the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the lord to walk after the lord and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all his heart and with all his soul to perform the words of the covenant which are written in this book 3432 and he caused all that were present in jerusalem and benjamin to stand to it and the inhabitants of jerusalem did according to the covenant of god the god of their fathers 3433 and josiah took away all the abominations out of all the countries that pertained to the children of israel and made all that were present in israel to serve even to serve the lord their god and all his days they departed not from following the lord the god of their fathers 351 moreover josiah kept a passover unto the lord in jerusalem and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month 352 and he set the priests in their charges and encouraged them to the service of the house of the lord 353 and said unto the levites that taught all israel which were holy unto the lord put the holy ark in the house which solomon the son of david king of israel did build it shall not be a burden upon your shoulders serve now the lord your god and his people israel 354 and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers after your courses according to the writing of david king of israel and according to the writing of solomon his son 355 and stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren the people and after the division of the families of the levites 356 so kill the passover and sanctify yourselves and prepare your brethren that they may do according to the word of the lord by the hand of moses 357 and josiah gave to the people of the flock lambs and kids all for the passover offerings for all that were present to the number of thirty thousand and three thousand bullocks these were of the kings substance 358 and his princes gave willingly unto the people to the priests and to the levites hilkiah and zechariah and jehiel rulers of the house of god gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle and three hundred oxen 359 conaniah also and shemaiah and nethaneel his brethren and hashabiah and jeiel and jozabad chief of the levites gave unto the levites for passover offerings five thousand small cattle and five hundred oxen 3510 so the service was prepared and the priests stood in their place and the levites in their courses according to the kings commandment 3511 and they killed the passover and the priests sprinkled the blood from their hands and the levites flayed them 3512 and they removed the burnt offerings that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people to offer unto the lord as it is written in the book of moses and so did they with the oxen 3513 and they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance but the other holy offerings sod they in pots and in caldrons and in pans and divided them speedily among all the people 3514 and afterward they made ready for themselves and for the priests because the priests the sons of aaron were busied in offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night therefore the levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of aaron 3515 and the singers the sons of asaph were in their place according to the commandment of david and asaph and heman and jeduthun the kings seer and the porters waited at every gate they might not depart from their service for their brethren the levites prepared for them 3516 so all the service of the lord was prepared the same day to keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar of the lord according to the commandment of king josiah 3517 and the children of israel that were present kept the passover at that time and the feast of unleavened bread seven days 3518 and there was no passover like to that kept in israel from the days of samuel the prophet neither did all the kings of israel keep such a passover as josiah kept and the priests and the levites and all judah and israel that were present and the inhabitants of jerusalem 3519 in the eighteenth year of the reign of josiah was this passover kept 3520 after all this when josiah had prepared the temple necho king of egypt came up to fight against charchemish by euphrates and josiah went out against him 3521 but he sent ambassadors to him saying what have i to do with thee thou king of judah i come not against thee this day but against the house wherewith i have war for god commanded me to make haste forbear thee from meddling with god who is with me that he destroy thee not 3522 nevertheless josiah would not turn his face from him but disguised himself that he might fight with him and hearkened not unto the words of necho from the mouth of god and came to fight in the valley of megiddo 3523 and the archers shot at king josiah and the king said to his servants have me away for i am sore wounded 3524 his servants therefore took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had and they brought him to jerusalem and he died and was buried in one of the sepulchres of his fathers and all judah and jerusalem mourned for josiah 3525 and jeremiah lamented for josiah and all the singing men and the singing women spake of josiah in their lamentations to this day and made them an ordinance in israel and behold they are written in the lamentations 3526 now the rest of the acts of josiah and his goodness according to that which was written in the law of the lord 3527 and his deeds first and last behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah 361 then the people of the land took jehoahaz the son of josiah and made him king in his fathers stead in jerusalem 362 jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months in jerusalem 363 and the king of egypt put him down at jerusalem and condemned the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold 364 and the king of egypt made eliakim his brother king over judah and jerusalem and turned his name to jehoiakim and necho took jehoahaz his brother and carried him to egypt 365 jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god 366 against him came up nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and bound him in fetters to carry him to babylon 367 nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the lord to babylon and put them in his temple at babylon 368 now the rest of the acts of jehoiakim and his abominations which he did and that which was found in him behold they are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah and jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead 369 jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned three months and ten days in jerusalem and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord 3610 and when the year was expired king nebuchadnezzar sent and brought him to babylon with the goodly vessels of the house of the lord and made zedekiah his brother king over judah and jerusalem 3611 zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned eleven years in jerusalem 3612 and he did that which was evil in the sight of the lord his god and humbled not himself before jeremiah the prophet speaking from the mouth of the lord 3613 and he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezzar who had made him swear by god but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart from turning unto the lord god of israel 3614 moreover all the chief of the priests and the people transgressed very much after all the abominations of the heathen and polluted the house of the lord which he had hallowed in jerusalem 3615 and the lord god of their fathers sent to them by his messengers rising up betimes and sending because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place 3616 but they mocked the messengers of god and despised his words and misused his prophets until the wrath of the lord arose against his people till there was no remedy 3617 therefore he brought upon them the king of the chaldees who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion upon young man or maiden old man or him that stooped for age he gave them all into his hand 3618 and all the vessels of the house of god great and small and the treasures of the house of the lord and the treasures of the king and of his princes all these he brought to babylon 3619 and they burnt the house of god and brake down the wall of jerusalem and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof 3620 and them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to babylon where they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of persia 3621 to fulfil the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her sabbaths for as long as she lay desolate she kept sabbath to fulfil threescore and ten years 3622 now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord spoken by the mouth of jeremiah might be accomplished the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying 3623 thus saith cyrus king of persia all the kingdoms of the earth hath the lord god of heaven given me and he hath charged me to build him an house in jerusalem which is in judah who is there among you of all his people the lord his god be with him and let him go up ezra 11 now in the first year of cyrus king of persia that the word of the lord by the mouth of jeremiah might be fulfilled the lord stirred up the spirit of cyrus king of persia that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and put it also in writing saying 12 thus saith cyrus king of persia the lord god of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he hath charged me to build him an house at jerusalem which is in judah 13 who is there among you of all his people his god be with him and let him go up to jerusalem which is in judah and build the house of the lord god of israel he is the god which is in jerusalem 14 and whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth let the men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods and with beasts beside the freewill offering for the house of god that is in jerusalem 15 then rose up the chief of the fathers of judah and benjamin and the priests and the levites with all them whose spirit god had raised to go up to build the house of the lord which is in jerusalem 16 and all they that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver with gold with goods and with beasts and with precious things beside all that was willingly offered 17 also cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of the lord which nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of jerusalem and had put them in the house of his gods 18 even those did cyrus king of persia bring forth by the hand of mithredath the treasurer and numbered them unto sheshbazzar the prince of judah 19 and this is the number of them thirty chargers of gold a thousand chargers of silver nine and twenty knives 110 thirty basons of gold silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten and other vessels a thousand 111 all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and four hundred all these did

register among those that were reckoned by genealogy but they were not found therefore were they as polluted put from the priesthood 263 and the tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the most holy things till there stood up a priest with urim and with thummim 264 the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore 265 beside their servants and their maids of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven and there were among them two hundred singing men and singing women 266 their horses were seven hundred thirty and six their mules two hundred forty and five 267 their camels four hundred thirty and five their asses six thousand seven hundred and twenty 268 and some of the chief of the fathers when they came to the house of the lord which is at jerusalem offered freely for the house of god to set it up in his place 269 they gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work threescore and one thousand drams of gold and five thousand pound of silver and one hundred priests garments 270 so the priests and the levites and some of the people and the singers and the porters and the nethinims dwelt in their cities and all israel in their cities 31 and when the seventh month was come and the children of israel were in the cities the people gathered themselves together as one man to jerusalem 32 then stood up jeshua the son of jozadak and his brethren the priests and zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and his brethren and builded the altar of the god of israel to offer burnt offerings thereon as it is written in the law of moses the man of god 33 and they set the altar upon his bases for fear was upon them because of the people of those countries and they offered burnt offerings thereon unto the lord even burnt offerings morning and evening 34 they kept also the feast of tabernacles as it is written and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the custom as the duty of every day required 35 and afterward offered the continual burnt offering both of the new moons and of all the set feasts of the lord that were consecrated and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering unto the lord 36 from the first day of the seventh month began they to offer burnt offerings unto the lord but the foundation of the temple of the lord was not yet laid 37 they gave money also unto the masons and to the carpenters and meat and drink and oil unto them of zidon and to them of tyre to bring cedar trees from lebanon to the sea of joppa according to the grant that they had of cyrus king of persia 38 now in the second year of their coming unto the house of god at jerusalem in the second month began zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak and the remnant of their brethren the priests and the levites and all they that were come out of the captivity unto jerusalem and appointed the levites from twenty years old and upward to set forward the work of the house of the lord 39 then stood jeshua with his sons and his brethren kadmiel and his sons the sons of judah together to set forward the workmen in the house of god the sons of henadad with their sons and their brethren the levites 310 and when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the lord they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets and the levites the sons of asaph with cymbals to praise the lord after the ordinance of david king of israel 311 and they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks unto the lord because he is good for his mercy endureth for ever toward israel and all the people shouted with a great shout when they praised the lord because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid 312 but many of the priests and levites and chief of the fathers who were ancient men that had seen the first house when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes wept with a loud voice and many shouted aloud for joy 313 so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people for the people shouted with a loud shout and the noise was heard afar off 41 now when the adversaries of judah and benjamin heard that the children of the captivity builded the temple unto the lord god of israel 42 then they came to zerubbabel and to the chief of the fathers and said unto them let us build with you for we seek your god as ye do and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of esarhaddon king of assur which brought us up hither 43 but zerubbabel and jeshua and the rest of the chief of the fathers of israel said unto them ye have nothing to do with us to build an house unto our god but we ourselves together will build unto the lord god of israel as king cyrus the king of persia hath commanded us 44 then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of judah and troubled them in building 45 and hired counsellors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of cyrus king of persia even until the reign of darius king of persia 46 and in the reign of ahasuerus in the beginning of his reign wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of judah and jerusalem 47 and in the days of artaxerxes wrote bishlam mithredath tabeel and the rest of their companions unto artaxerxes king of persia and the writing of the letter was written in the syrian tongue and interpreted in the syrian tongue 48 rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king in this sort 49 then wrote rehum the chancellor and shimshai the scribe and the rest of their companions the dinaites the apharsathchites the tarpelites the apharsites the archevites the babylonians the susanchites the dehavites and the elamites 410 and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble asnapper brought over and set in the cities of samaria and the rest that are on this side the river and at such a time 411 this is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him even unto artaxerxes the king thy servants the men on this side the river and at such a time 412 be it known unto the king that the jews which came up from thee to us are come unto jerusalem building the rebellious and the bad city and have set up the walls thereof and joined the foundations 413 be it known now unto the king that if this city be builded and the walls set up again then will they not pay toll tribute and custom and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of the kings 414 now because we have maintenance from the kings palace and it was not meet for us to see the kings dishonour therefore have we sent and certified the king 415 that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers so shalt thou find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city and hurtful unto kings and provinces and that they have moved sedition within the same of old time for which cause was this city destroyed 416 we certify the king that if this city be builded again and the walls thereof set up by this means thou shalt have no portion on this side the river 417 then sent the king an answer unto rehum the chancellor and to shimshai the scribe and to the rest of their companions that dwell in samaria and unto the rest beyond the river peace and at such a time 418 the letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before me 419 and i commanded and search hath been made and it is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein 420 there have been mighty kings also over jerusalem which have ruled over all countries beyond the river and toll tribute and custom was paid unto them 421 give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease and that this city be not builded until another commandment shall be given from me 422 take heed now that ye fail not to do this why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings 423 now when the copy of king artaxerxes letter was read before rehum and shimshai the scribe and their companions they went up in haste to jerusalem unto the jews and made them to cease by force and power 424 then ceased the work of the house of god which is at jerusalem so it ceased unto the second year of the reign of darius king of persia 51 then the prophets haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo prophesied unto the jews that were in judah and jerusalem in the name of the god of israel even unto them 52 then rose up zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and jeshua the son of jozadak and began to build the house of god which is at jerusalem and with them were the prophets of god helping them 53 at the same time came to them tatnai governor on this side the river and shetharboznai and their companions and said thus unto them who hath commanded you to build this house and to make up this wall 54 then said we unto them after this manner what are the names of the men that make this building 55 but the eye of their god was upon the elders of the jews that they could not cause them to cease till the matter came to darius and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter 56 the copy of the letter that tatnai governor on this side the river and shetharboznai and his companions the apharsachites which were on this side the river sent unto darius the king 57 they sent a letter unto him wherein was written thus unto darius the king all peace 58 be it known unto the king that we went into the province of judea to the house of the great god which is builded with great stones and timber is laid in the walls and this work goeth fast on and prospereth in their hands 59 then asked we those elders and said unto them thus who commanded you to build this house and to make up these walls 510 we asked their names also to certify thee that we might write the names of the men that were the chief of them 511 and thus they returned us answer saying we are the servants of the god of heaven and earth and build the house that was builded these many years ago which a great king of israel builded and set up 512 but after that our fathers had provoked the god of heaven unto wrath he gave them into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon the chaldean who destroyed this house and carried the people away into babylon 513 but in the first year of cyrus the king of babylon the same king cyrus made a decree to build this house of god 514 and the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in jerusalem and brought them into the temple of babylon those did cyrus the king take out of the temple of babylon and they were delivered unto one whose name was sheshbazzar whom he had made governor 515 and said unto him take these vessels go carry them into the temple that is in jerusalem and let the house of god be builded in his place 516 then came the same sheshbazzar and laid the foundation of the house of god which is in jerusalem and since that time even until now hath it been in building and yet it is not finished 517 now therefore if it seem good to the king let there be search made in the kings treasure house which is there at babylon whether it be so that a decree was made of cyrus the king to build this house of god at jerusalem and let the king send his pleasure to us concerning this matter 61 then darius the king made a decree and search was made in the house of the rolls where the treasures were laid up in babylon 62 and there was found at achmetha in the palace that is in the province of the medes a roll and therein was a record thus written 63 in the first year of cyrus the king the same cyrus the king made a decree concerning the house of god at jerusalem let the house be builded the place where they offered sacrifices and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid the height thereof threescore cubits and the breadth thereof threescore cubits 64 with three rows of great stones and a row of new timber and let the expenses be given out of the kings house 65 and also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which is at jerusalem and brought unto babylon be restored and brought again unto the temple which is at jerusalem every one to his place and place them in the house of god 66 now therefore tatnai governor beyond the river shetharboznai and your companions the apharsachites which are beyond the river be ye far from thence 67 let the work of this house of god alone let the governor of the jews and the elders of the jews build this house of god in his place 68 moreover i make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of these jews for the building of this house of god that of the kings goods even of the tribute beyond the river forthwith expenses be given unto these men that they be not hindered 69 and that which they have need of both young bullocks and rams and lambs for the burnt offerings of the god of heaven wheat salt wine and oil according to the appointment of the priests which are at jerusalem let it be given them day by day without fail 610 that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the god of heaven and pray for the life of the king and of his sons 611 also i have made a decree that whosoever shall alter this word let timber be pulled down from his house and being set up let him be hanged thereon and let his house be made a dunghill for this 612 and the god that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people that shall put to their hand to alter and to destroy this house of god which is at jerusalem i darius have made a decree let it be done with speed 613 then tatnai governor on this side the river shetharboznai and their companions according to that which darius the king had sent so they did speedily 614 and the elders of the jews builded and they prospered through the prophesying of haggai the prophet and zechariah the son of iddo and they builded and finished it according to the commandment of the god of israel and according to the commandment of cyrus and darius and artaxerxes king of persia 615 and this house was finished on the third day of the month adar which was in the sixth year of the reign of darius the king 616 and the children of israel the priests and the levites and the rest of the children of the captivity kept the dedication of this house of god with joy 617 and offered at the dedication of this house of god an hundred bullocks two hundred rams four hundred lambs and for a sin offering for all israel twelve he goats according to the number of the tribes of israel 618 and they set the priests in their divisions and the levites in their courses for the service of god which is at jerusalem as it is written in the book of moses 619 and the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month 620 for the priests and the levites were purified together all of them were pure and killed the passover for all the children of the captivity and for their brethren the priests and for themselves 621 and the children of israel which were come again out of captivity and all such as had separated themselves unto them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land to seek the lord god of israel did eat 622 and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy for the lord had made them joyful and turned the heart of the king of assyria unto them to strengthen their hands in the work of the house of god the god of israel 71 now after these things in the reign of artaxerxes king of persia ezra the son of seraiah the son of azariah the son of hilkiah 72 the son of shallum the son of zadok the son of ahitub 73 the son of amariah the son of azariah the son of meraioth 74 the son of zerahiah the son of uzzi the son of bukki 75 the son of abishua the son of phinehas the son of eleazar the son of aaron the chief priest 76 this ezra went up from babylon and he was a ready scribe in the law of moses which the lord god of israel had given and the king granted him all his request according to the hand of the lord his god upon him 77 and there went up some of the children of israel and of the priests and the levites and the singers and the porters and the nethinims unto jerusalem in the seventh year of artaxerxes the king 78 and he came to jerusalem in the fifth month which was in the seventh year of the king 79 for upon the first day of the first month began he to go up from babylon and on the first day of the fifth month came he to jerusalem according to the good hand of his god upon him 710 for ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the lord and to do it and to teach in israel statutes and judgments 711 now this is the copy of the letter that the king artaxerxes gave unto ezra the priest the scribe even a scribe of the words of the commandments of the lord and of his statutes to israel 712 artaxerxes king of kings unto ezra the priest a scribe of the law of the god of heaven perfect peace and at such a time 713 i make a decree that all they of the people of israel and of his priests and levites in my realm which are minded of their own freewill to go up to jerusalem go with thee 714 forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and of his seven counsellors to enquire concerning judah and jerusalem according to the law of thy god which is in thine hand 715 and to carry the silver and gold which the king and his counsellors have freely offered unto the god of israel whose habitation is in jerusalem 716 and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of babylon with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests offering willingly for the house of their god which is in jerusalem 717 that thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks rams lambs with their meat offerings and their drink offerings and offer them upon the altar of the house of your god which is in jerusalem 718 and whatsoever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren to do with the rest of the silver and the gold that do after the will of your god 719 the vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy god those deliver thou before the god of jerusalem 720 and whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy god which thou shalt have occasion to bestow bestow it out of the kings treasure house 721 and i even i artaxerxes the king do make a decree to all the treasurers which are beyond the river that whatsoever ezra the priest the scribe of the law of the god of heaven shall require of you it be done speedily 722 unto an hundred talents of silver and to an hundred measures of wheat and to an hundred baths of wine and to an hundred baths of oil and salt without prescribing how much 723 whatsoever is commanded by the god of heaven let it be diligently done for the house of the god of heaven for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons 724 also we certify you that touching any of the priests and levites singers porters nethinims or ministers of this house of god it shall not be lawful to impose toll tribute or custom upon them 725 and thou ezra after the wisdom of thy god that is in thine hand set magistrates and judges which may judge all the people that are beyond the river all such as know the laws of thy god and teach ye them that know them not 726 and whosoever will not do the law of thy god and the law of the king let judgment be executed speedily upon him whether it be unto death or to banishment or to confiscation of goods or to imprisonment 727 blessed be the lord god of our fathers which hath put such a thing as this in the kings heart to beautify the house of the lord which is in jerusalem 728 and hath extended mercy unto me before the king and his counsellors and before all the kings mighty princes and i was strengthened as the hand of the lord my god was upon me and i

uthai and zabbud and with them seventy males 815 and i gathered them together to the river that runneth to ahava and there abode we in tents three days and i viewed the people and the priests and found there none of the sons of levi 816 then sent i for eliezer for ariel for shemaiah and for elnathan and for jarib and for elnathan and for nathan and for zechariah and for meshullam chief men also for joiarib and for elnathan men of understanding 817 and i sent them with commandment unto iddo the chief at the place casiphia and i told them what they should say unto iddo and to his brethren the nethinims at the place casiphia that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our god 818 and by the good hand of our god upon us they brought us a man of understanding of the sons of mahli the son of levi the son of israel and sherebiah with his sons and his brethren eighteen 819 and hashabiah and with him jeshaiah of the sons of merari his brethren and their sons twenty 820 also of the nethinims whom david and the princes had appointed for the service of the levites two hundred and twenty nethinims all of them were expressed by name 821 then i proclaimed a fast there at the river of ahava that we might afflict ourselves before our god to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance 822 for i was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way because we had spoken unto the king saying the hand of our god is upon all them for good that seek him but his power and his wrath is against all them that forsake him 823 so we fasted and besought our god for this and he was intreated of us 824 then i separated twelve of the chief of the priests sherebiah hashabiah and ten of their brethren with them 825 and weighed unto them the silver and the gold and the vessels even the offering of the house of our god which the king and his counsellors and his lords and all israel there present had offered 826 i even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver and silver vessels an hundred talents and of gold an hundred talents 827 also twenty basons of gold of a thousand drams and two vessels of fine copper precious as gold 828 and i said unto them ye are holy unto the lord the vessels are holy also and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the lord god of your fathers 829 watch ye and keep them until ye weigh them before the chief of the priests and the levites and chief of the fathers of israel at jerusalem in the chambers of the house of the lord 830 so took the priests and the levites the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels to bring them to jerusalem unto the house of our god 831 then we departed from the river of ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go unto jerusalem and the hand of our god was upon us and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of such as lay in wait by the way 832 and we came to jerusalem and abode there three days 833 now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the vessels weighed in the house of our god by the hand of meremoth the son of uriah the priest and with him was eleazar the son of phinehas and with them was jozabad the son of jeshua and noadiah the son of binnui levites 834 by number and by weight of every one and all the weight was written at that time 835 also the children of those that had been carried away which were come out of the captivity offered burnt offerings unto the god of israel twelve bullocks for all israel ninety and six rams seventy and seven lambs twelve he goats for a sin offering all this was a burnt offering unto the lord 836 and they delivered the kings commissions unto the kings lieutenants and to the governors on this side the river and they furthered the people and the house of god 91 now when these things were done the princes came to me saying the people of israel and the priests and the levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands doing according to their abominations even of the canaanites the hittites the perizzites the jebusites the ammonites the moabites the egyptians and the amorites 92 for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with the people of those lands yea the hand of the princes and rulers hath been chief in this trespass 93 and when i heard this thing i rent my garment and my mantle and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard and sat down astonied 94 then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the words of the god of israel because of the transgression of those that had been carried away and i sat astonied until the evening sacrifice 95 and at the evening sacrifice i arose up from my heaviness and having rent my garment and my mantle i fell upon my knees and spread out my hands unto the lord my god 96 and said o my god i am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to thee my god for our iniquities are increased over our head and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens 97 since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass unto this day and for our iniquities have we our kings and our priests been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands to the sword to captivity and to a spoil and to confusion of face as it is this day 98 and now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the lord our god to leave us a remnant to escape and to give us a nail in his holy place that our god may lighten our eyes and give us a little reviving in our bondage 99 for we were bondmen yet our god hath not forsaken us in our bondage but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the kings of persia to give us a reviving to set up the house of our god and to repair the desolations thereof and to give us a wall in judah and in jerusalem 910 and now o our god what shall we say after this for we have forsaken thy commandments 911 which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets saying the land unto which ye go to possess it is an unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands with their abominations which have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness 912 now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons neither take their daughters unto your sons nor seek their peace or their wealth for ever that ye may be strong and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever 913 and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great trespass seeing that thou our god hast punished us less than our iniquities deserve and hast given us such deliverance as this 914 should we again break thy commandments and join in affinity with the people of these abominations wouldest not thou be angry with us till thou hadst consumed us so that there should be no remnant nor escaping 915 o lord god of israel thou art righteous for we remain yet escaped as it is this day behold we are before thee in our trespasses for we cannot stand before thee because of this 101 now when ezra had prayed and when he had confessed weeping and casting himself down before the house of god there assembled unto him out of israel a very great congregation of men and women and children for the people wept very sore 102 and shechaniah the son of jehiel one of the sons of elam answered and said unto ezra we have trespassed against our god and have taken strange wives of the people of the land yet now there is hope in israel concerning this thing 103 now therefore let us make a covenant with our god to put away all the wives and such as are born of them according to the counsel of my lord and of those that tremble at the commandment of our god and let it be done according to the law 104 arise for this matter belongeth unto thee we also will be with thee be of good courage and do it 105 then arose ezra and made the chief priests the levites and all israel to swear that they should do according to this word and they sware 106 then ezra rose up from before the house of god and went into the chamber of johanan the son of eliashib and when he came thither he did eat no bread nor drink water for he mourned because of the transgression of them that had been carried away 107 and they made proclamation throughout judah and jerusalem unto all the children of the captivity that they should gather themselves together unto jerusalem 108 and that whosoever would not come within three days according to the counsel of the princes and the elders all his substance should be forfeited and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away 109 then all the men of judah and benjamin gathered themselves together unto jerusalem within three days it was the ninth month on the twentieth day of the month and all the people sat in the street of the house of god trembling because of this matter and for the great rain 1010 and ezra the priest stood up and said unto them ye have transgressed and have taken strange wives to increase the trespass of israel 1011 now therefore make confession unto the lord god of your fathers and do his pleasure and separate yourselves from the people of the land and from the strange wives 1012 then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice as thou hast said so must we do 1013 but the people are many and it is a time of much rain and we are not able to stand without neither is this a work of one day or two for we are many that have transgressed in this thing 1014 let now our rulers of all the congregation stand and let all them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at appointed times and with them the elders of every city and the judges thereof until the fierce wrath of our god for this matter be turned from us 1015 only jonathan the son of asahel and jahaziah the son of tikvah were employed about this matter and meshullam and shabbethai the levite helped them 1016 and the children of the captivity did so and ezra the priest with certain chief of the fathers after the house of their fathers and all of them by their names were separated and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the matter 1017 and they made an end with all the men that had taken strange wives by the first day of the first month 1018 and among the sons of the priests there were found that had taken strange wives namely of the sons of jeshua the son of jozadak and his brethren maaseiah and eliezer and jarib and gedaliah 1019 and they gave their hands that they would put away their wives and being guilty they offered a ram of the flock for their trespass 1020 and of the sons of immer hanani and zebadiah 1021 and of the sons of harim maaseiah and elijah and shemaiah and jehiel and uzziah 1022 and of the sons of pashur elioenai maaseiah ishmael nethaneel jozabad and elasah 1023 also of the levites jozabad and shimei and kelaiah the same is kelita pethahiah judah and eliezer 1024 of the singers also eliashib and of the porters shallum and telem and uri 1025 moreover of israel of the sons of parosh ramiah and jeziah and malchiah and miamin and eleazar and malchijah and benaiah 1026 and of the sons of elam mattaniah zechariah and jehiel and abdi and jeremoth and eliah 1027 and of the sons of zattu elioenai eliashib mattaniah and jeremoth and zabad and aziza 1028 of the sons also of bebai jehohanan hananiah zabbai and athlai 1029 and of the sons of bani meshullam malluch and adaiah jashub and sheal and ramoth 1030 and of the sons of pahathmoab adna and chelal benaiah maaseiah mattaniah bezaleel and binnui and manasseh 1031 and of the sons of harim eliezer ishijah malchiah shemaiah shimeon 1032 benjamin malluch and shemariah 1033 of the sons of hashum mattenai mattathah zabad eliphelet jeremai manasseh and shimei 1034 of the sons of bani maadai amram and uel 1035 benaiah bedeiah chelluh 1036 vaniah meremoth eliashib 1037 mattaniah mattenai and jaasau 1038 and bani and binnui shimei 1039 and shelemiah and nathan and adaiah 1040 machnadebai shashai sharai 1041 azareel and shelemiah shemariah 1042 shallum amariah and joseph 1043 of the sons of nebo jeiel mattithiah zabad zebina jadau and joel benaiah 1044 all these had taken strange wives and some of them had wives by whom they had children the book of nehemiah 11 the words of nehemiah the son of hachaliah and it came to pass in the month chisleu in the twentieth year as i was in shushan the palace 12 that hanani one of my brethren came he and certain men of judah and i asked them concerning the jews that had escaped which were left of the captivity and concerning jerusalem 13 and they said unto me the remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach the wall of jerusalem also is broken down and the gates thereof are burned with fire 14 and it came to pass when i heard these words that i sat down and wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the god of heaven 15 and said i beseech thee o lord god of heaven the great and terrible god that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments 16 let thine ear now be attentive and thine eyes open that thou mayest hear the prayer of thy servant which i pray before thee now day and night for the children of israel thy servants and confess the sins of the children of israel which we have sinned against thee both i and my fathers house have sinned 17 we have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments which thou commandedst thy servant moses 18 remember i beseech thee the word that thou commandedst thy servant moses saying if ye transgress i will scatter you abroad among the nations 19 but if ye turn unto me and keep my commandments and do them though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven yet will i gather them from thence and will bring them unto the place that i have chosen to set my name there 110 now these are thy servants and thy people whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand 111 o lord i beseech thee let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name and prosper i pray thee thy servant this day and grant him mercy in the sight of this man for i was the kings cupbearer 21 and it came to pass in the month nisan in the twentieth year of artaxerxes the king that wine was before him and i took up the wine and gave it unto the king now i had not been beforetime sad in his presence 22 wherefore the king said unto me why is thy countenance sad seeing thou art not sick this is nothing else but sorrow of heart then i was very sore afraid 23 and said unto the king let the king live for ever why should not my countenance be sad when the city the place of my fathers sepulchres lieth waste and the gates thereof are consumed with fire 24 then the king said unto me for what dost thou make request so i prayed to the god of heaven 25 and i said unto the king if it please the king and if thy servant have found favour in thy sight that thou wouldest send me unto judah unto the city of my fathers sepulchres that i may build it 26 and the king said unto me the queen also sitting by him for how long shall thy journey be and when wilt thou return so it pleased the king to send me and i set him a time 27 moreover i said unto the king if it please the king let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river that they may convey me over till i come into judah 28 and a letter unto asaph the keeper of the kings forest that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace which appertained to the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that i shall enter into and the king granted me according to the good hand of my god upon me 29 then i came to the governors beyond the river and gave them the kings letters now the king had sent captains of the army and horsemen with me 210 when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite heard of it it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of israel 211 so i came to jerusalem and was there three days 212 and i arose in the night i and some few men with me neither told i any man what my god had put in my heart to do at jerusalem neither was there any beast with me save the beast that i rode upon 213 and i went out by night by the gate of the valley even before the dragon well and to the dung port and viewed the walls of jerusalem which were broken down and the gates thereof were consumed with fire 214 then i went on to the gate of the fountain and to the kings pool but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass 215 then went i up in the night by the brook and viewed the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so returned 216 and the rulers knew not whither i went or what i did neither had i as yet told it to the jews nor to the priests nor to the nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work 217 then said i unto them ye see the distress that we are in how jerusalem lieth waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come and let us build up the wall of jerusalem that we be no more a reproach 218 then i told them of the hand of my god which was good upon me as also the kings words that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthened their hands for this good work 219 but when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the servant the ammonite and geshem the arabian heard it they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said what is this thing that ye do will ye rebel against the king 220 then answered i them and said unto them the god of heaven he will prosper us therefore we his servants will arise and build but ye have no portion nor right nor memorial in jerusalem 31 then eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests and they builded the sheep gate they sanctified it and set up the doors of it even unto the tower of meah they sanctified it unto the tower of hananeel 32 and next unto him builded the men of jericho and next to them builded zaccur the son of imri 33 but the fish gate did the sons of hassenaah build who also laid the beams thereof and set up the doors thereof the locks thereof and the bars thereof 34 and next unto them repaired meremoth the son of urijah the son of koz and next unto them repaired meshullam the son of berechiah the son of meshezabeel and next unto them repaired zadok the son of baana 35 and next unto them the tekoites repaired but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their lord 36 moreover the old gate repaired jehoiada the son of paseah and meshullam the son of besodeiah they laid the beams thereof and set up the doors thereof and the locks

next unto him repaired uzziel the son of harhaiah of the goldsmiths next unto him also repaired hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries and they fortified jerusalem unto the broad wall 39 and next unto them repaired rephaiah the son of hur the ruler of the half part of jerusalem 310 and next unto them repaired jedaiah the son of harumaph even over against his house and next unto him repaired hattush the son of hashabniah 311 malchijah the son of harim and hashub the son of pahathmoab repaired the other piece and the tower of the furnaces 312 and next unto him repaired shallum the son of halohesh the ruler of the half part of jerusalem he and his daughters 313 the valley gate repaired hanun and the inhabitants of zanoah they built it and set up the doors thereof the locks thereof and the bars thereof and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung gate 314 but the dung gate repaired malchiah the son of rechab the ruler of part of bethhaccerem he built it and set up the doors thereof the locks thereof and the bars thereof 315 but the gate of the fountain repaired shallun the son of colhozeh the ruler of part of mizpah he built it and covered it and set up the doors thereof the locks thereof and the bars thereof and the wall of the pool of siloah by the kings garden and unto the stairs that go down from the city of david 316 after him repaired nehemiah the son of azbuk the ruler of the half part of bethzur unto the place over against the sepulchres of david and to the pool that was made and unto the house of the mighty 317 after him repaired the levites rehum the son of bani next unto him repaired hashabiah the ruler of the half part of keilah in his part 318 after him repaired their brethren bavai the son of henadad the ruler of the half part of keilah 319 and next to him repaired ezer the son of jeshua the ruler of mizpah another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall 320 after him baruch the son of zabbai earnestly repaired the other piece from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of eliashib the high priest 321 after him repaired meremoth the son of urijah the son of koz another piece from the door of the house of eliashib even to the end of the house of eliashib 322 and after him repaired the priests the men of the plain 323 after him repaired benjamin and hashub over against their house after him repaired azariah the son of maaseiah the son of ananiah by his house 324 after him repaired binnui the son of henadad another piece from the house of azariah unto the turning of the wall even unto the corner 325 palal the son of uzai over against the turning of the wall and the tower which lieth out from the kings high house that was by the court of the prison after him pedaiah the son of parosh 326 moreover the nethinims dwelt in ophel unto the place over against the water gate toward the east and the tower that lieth out 327 after them the tekoites repaired another piece over against the great tower that lieth out even unto the wall of ophel 328 from above the horse gate repaired the priests every one over against his house 329 after them repaired zadok the son of immer over against his house after him repaired also shemaiah the son of shechaniah the keeper of the east gate 330 after him repaired hananiah the son of shelemiah and hanun the sixth son of zalaph another piece after him repaired meshullam the son of berechiah over against his chamber 331 after him repaired malchiah the goldsmiths son unto the place of the nethinims and of the merchants over against the gate miphkad and to the going up of the corner 332 and between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants 41 but it came to pass that when sanballat heard that we builded the wall he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the jews 42 and he spake before his brethren and the army of samaria and said what do these feeble jews will they fortify themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned 43 now tobiah the ammonite was by him and he said even that which they build if a fox go up he shall even break down their stone wall 44 hear o our god for we are despised and turn their reproach upon their own head and give them for a prey in the land of captivity 45 and cover not their iniquity and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders 46 so built we the wall and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof for the people had a mind to work 47 but it came to pass that when sanballat and tobiah and the arabians and the ammonites and the ashdodites heard that the walls of jerusalem were made up and that the breaches began to be stopped then they were very wroth 48 and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against jerusalem and to hinder it 49 nevertheless we made our prayer unto our god and set a watch against them day and night because of them 410 and judah said the strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall 411 and our adversaries said they shall not know neither see till we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease 412 and it came to pass that when the jews which dwelt by them came they said unto us ten times from all places whence ye shall return unto us they will be upon you 413 therefore set i in the lower places behind the wall and on the higher places i even set the people after their families with their swords their spears and their bows 414 and i looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not ye afraid of them remember the lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses 415 and it came to pass when our enemies heard that it was known unto us and god had brought their counsel to nought that we returned all of us to the wall every one unto his work 416 and it came to pass from that time forth that the half of my servants wrought in the work and the other half of them held both the spears the shields and the bows and the habergeons and the rulers were behind all the house of judah 417 they which builded on the wall and they that bare burdens with those that laded every one with one of his hands wrought in the work and with the other hand held a weapon 418 for the builders every one had his sword girded by his side and so builded and he that sounded the trumpet was by me 419 and i said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people the work is great and large and we are separated upon the wall one far from another 420 in what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet resort ye thither unto us our god shall fight for us 421 so we laboured in the work and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared 422 likewise at the same time said i unto the people let every one with his servant lodge within jerusalem that in the night they may be a guard to us and labour on the day 423 so neither i nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the guard which followed me none of us put off our clothes saving that every one put them off for washing 51 and there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the jews 52 for there were that said we our sons and our daughters are many therefore we take up corn for them that we may eat and live 53 some also there were that said we have mortgaged our lands vineyards and houses that we might buy corn because of the dearth 54 there were also that said we have borrowed money for the kings tribute and that upon our lands and vineyards 55 yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren our children as their children and lo we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants and some of our daughters are brought unto bondage already neither is it in our power to redeem them for other men have our lands and vineyards 56 and i was very angry when i heard their cry and these words 57 then i consulted with myself and i rebuked the nobles and the rulers and said unto them ye exact usury every one of his brother and i set a great assembly against them 58 and i said unto them we after our ability have redeemed our brethren the jews which were sold unto the heathen and will ye even sell your brethren or shall they be sold unto us then held they their peace and found nothing to answer 59 also i said it is not good that ye do ought ye not to walk in the fear of our god because of the reproach of the heathen our enemies 510 i likewise and my brethren and my servants might exact of them money and corn i pray you let us leave off this usury 511 restore i pray you to them even this day their lands their vineyards their oliveyards and their houses also the hundredth part of the money and of the corn the wine and the oil that ye exact of them 512 then said they we will restore them and will require nothing of them so will we do as thou sayest then i called the priests and took an oath of them that they should do according to this promise 513 also i shook my lap and said so god shake out every man from his house and from his labour that performeth not this promise even thus be he shaken out and emptied and all the congregation said amen and praised the lord and the people did according to this promise 514 moreover from the time that i was appointed to be their governor in the land of judah from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes the king that is twelve years i and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor 515 but the former governors that had been before me were chargeable unto the people and had taken of them bread and wine beside forty shekels of silver yea even their servants bare rule over the people but so did not i because of the fear of god 516 yea also i continued in the work of this wall neither bought we any land and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work 517 moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the jews and rulers beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that are about us 518 now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six choice sheep also fowls were prepared for me and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine yet for all this required not i the bread of the governor because the bondage was heavy upon this people 519 think upon me my god for good according to all that i have done for this people 61 now it came to pass when sanballat and tobiah and geshem the arabian and the rest of our enemies heard that i had builded the wall and that there was no breach left therein though at that time i had not set up the doors upon the gates 62 that sanballat and geshem sent unto me saying come let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of ono but they thought to do me mischief 63 and i sent messengers unto them saying i am doing a great work so that i cannot come down why should the work cease whilst i leave it and come down to you 64 yet they sent unto me four times after this sort and i answered them after the same manner 65 then sent sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand 66 wherein was written it is reported among the heathen and gashmu saith it that thou and the jews think to rebel for which cause thou buildest the wall that thou mayest be their king according to these words 67 and thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at jerusalem saying there is a king in judah and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words come now therefore and let us take counsel together 68 then i sent unto him saying there are no such things done as thou sayest but thou feignest them out of thine own heart 69 for they all made us afraid saying their hands shall be weakened from the work that it be not done now therefore o god strengthen my hands 610 afterward i came unto the house of shemaiah the son of delaiah the son of mehetabeel who was shut up and he said let us meet together in the house of god within the temple and let us shut the doors of the temple for they will come to slay thee yea in the night will they come to slay thee 611 and i said should such a man as i flee and who is there that being as i am would go into the temple to save his life i will not go in 612 and lo i perceived that god had not sent him but that he pronounced this prophecy against me for tobiah and sanballat had hired him 613 therefore was he hired that i should be afraid and do so and sin and that they might have matter for an evil report that they might reproach me 614 my god think thou upon tobiah and sanballat according to these their works and on the prophetess noadiah and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear 615 so the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month elul in fifty and two days 616 and it came to pass that when all our enemies heard thereof and all the heathen that were about us saw these things they were much cast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was wrought of our god 617 moreover in those days the nobles of judah sent many letters unto tobiah and the letters of tobiah came unto them 618 for there were many in judah sworn unto him because he was the son in law of shechaniah the son of arah and his son johanan had taken the daughter of meshullam the son of berechiah 619 also they reported his good deeds before me and uttered my words to him and tobiah sent letters to put me in fear 71 now it came to pass when the wall was built and i had set up the doors and the porters and the singers and the levites were appointed 72 that i gave my brother hanani and hananiah the ruler of the palace charge over jerusalem for he was a faithful man and feared god above many 73 and i said unto them let not the gates of jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot and while they stand by let them shut the doors and bar them and appoint watches of the inhabitants of jerusalem every one in his watch and every one to be over against his house 74 now the city was large and great but the people were few therein and the houses were not builded 75 and my god put into mine heart to gather together the nobles and the rulers and the people that they might be reckoned by genealogy and i found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first and found written therein 76 these are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity of those that

from the priesthood 765 and the tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the most holy things till there stood up a priest with urim and thummim 766 the whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore 767 beside their manservants and their maidservants of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women 768 their horses seven hundred thirty and six their mules two hundred forty and five 769 their camels four hundred thirty and five six thousand seven hundred and

thousand drams of gold and two thousand pound of silver and threescore and seven priests garments 773 so the priests and the levites and the porters and the singers and some of the people and the nethinims and all israel dwelt in their cities and when the seventh month came the children of israel were in their cities 81 and all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate and they spake unto ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of moses which the lord had commanded to israel 82 and ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women and all that could hear with understanding upon the first day of the seventh month 83 and he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday before the men and the women and those that could understand and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law 84 and ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood which they had made for the purpose and beside him stood mattithiah and shema and anaiah and urijah and hilkiah and maaseiah on his right hand and on his left hand pedaiah and mishael and malchiah and hashum and hashbadana zechariah and meshullam 85 and ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people for he was above all the people and when he opened it all the people stood up 86 and ezra blessed the lord the great god and all the people answered amen amen with lifting up their hands and they bowed their heads and worshipped the lord with their faces to the ground 87 also jeshua and bani and sherebiah jamin akkub shabbethai hodijah maaseiah kelita azariah jozabad hanan pelaiah and the levites caused the people to understand the law and the people stood in their place 88 so they read in the book in the law of god distinctly and gave the sense and caused them to understand the reading 89 and nehemiah which is the tirshatha and ezra the priest the scribe and the levites that taught the people said unto all the people this day is holy unto the lord your god mourn not nor weep for all the people wept when they heard the words of the law 810 then he said unto them go your way eat the fat and drink the sweet and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared for this day is holy unto our lord neither be ye sorry for the joy of the lord is your strength 811 so the levites stilled all the people saying hold your peace for the day is holy neither be ye grieved 812 and all the people went their way to eat and to drink and to send portions and to make great mirth because they had understood the words that were declared unto them 813 and on the second day were gathered together the chief of the fathers of all the people the priests and the levites unto ezra the scribe even to understand the words of the law 814 and they found written in the law which the lord had commanded by moses that the children of israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month 815 and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities and in jerusalem saying go forth unto the mount and fetch olive branches and pine branches and myrtle branches and palm branches and branches of thick trees to make booths as it is written 816 so the people went forth and brought them and made themselves booths every one upon the roof of his house and in their courts and in the courts of the house of god and in the street of the water gate and in the street of the gate of ephraim 817 and all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths and sat under the booths for since the days of jeshua the son of nun unto that day had not the children of israel done so and there was very great gladness 818 also day by day from the first day unto the last day he read in the book of the law of god and they kept the feast seven days and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly according unto the manner 91 now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of israel were assembled with fasting and with sackclothes and earth upon them 92 and the seed of israel separated themselves from all strangers and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers 93 and they stood up in their place and read in the book of the law of the lord their god one fourth part of the day and another fourth part they confessed and worshipped the lord their god 94 then stood up upon the stairs of the levites jeshua and bani kadmiel shebaniah bunni sherebiah bani and chenani and cried with a loud voice unto the lord their god 95 then the levites jeshua and kadmiel bani hashabniah sherebiah hodijah shebaniah and pethahiah said stand up and bless the lord your god for ever and ever and blessed be thy glorious name which is exalted above all blessing and praise 96 thou even thou art lord alone thou hast made heaven the heaven of heavens with all their host the earth and all things that are therein the seas and all that is therein and thou preservest them all and the host of heaven worshippeth thee 97 thou art the lord the god who didst choose abram and broughtest him forth out of ur of the chaldees and gavest him the name of abraham 98 and foundest his heart faithful before thee and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the canaanites the hittites the amorites and the perizzites and the jebusites and the girgashites to give it i say to his seed and hast performed thy words for thou art righteous 99 and didst see the affliction of our fathers in egypt and heardest their cry by the red sea 910 and shewedst signs and wonders upon pharaoh and on all his servants and on all the people of his land for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them so didst thou get thee a name as it is this day 911 and thou didst divide the sea before them so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land and their persecutors thou threwest into the deeps as a stone into the mighty waters 912 moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar and in the night by a pillar of fire to give them light in the way wherein they should go 913 thou camest down also upon mount sinai and spakest with them from heaven and gavest them right judgments and true laws good statutes and commandments 914 and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath and commandedst them precepts statutes and laws by the hand of moses thy servant 915 and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst and promisedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them 916 but they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks and hearkened not to thy commandments 917 and refused to obey neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them but hardened their necks and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage but thou art a god ready to pardon gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and forsookest them not 918 yea when they had made them a molten calf and said this is thy god that brought thee up out of egypt and had wrought great provocations 919 yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to lead them in the way neither the pillar of fire by night to shew them light and the way wherein they should go 920 thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth and gavest them water for their thirst 921 yea forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness so that they lacked nothing their clothes waxed not old and their feet swelled not 922 moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations and didst divide them into corners so they possessed the land of sihon and the land of the king of heshbon and the land of og king of bashan 923 their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven and broughtest them into the land concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers that they should go in to possess it 924 so the children went in and possessed the land and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land the canaanites and gavest them into their hands with their kings and the people of the land that they might do with them as they would 925 and they took strong cities and a fat land and possessed houses full of all goods wells digged vineyards and oliveyards and fruit trees in abundance so they did eat and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodness 926 nevertheless they were disobedient and rebelled against thee and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets which testified against them to turn them to thee and they wrought great provocations 927 therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies who vexed them and in the time of their trouble when they cried unto thee thou heardest them from heaven and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their enemies 928 but after they had rest they did evil again before thee therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies so that they had the dominion over them yet when they returned and cried unto thee thou heardest them from heaven and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies 929 and testifiedst against them that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law yet they dealt proudly and hearkened not unto thy commandments but sinned against thy judgments which if a man do he shall live in them and withdrew the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear 930 yet many years didst thou forbear them and testifiedst against them by thy spirit in thy prophets yet would they not give ear therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands 931 nevertheless for thy great mercies sake thou didst not utterly consume them nor forsake them for thou art a gracious and merciful god 932 now therefore our god the great the mighty and the terrible god who keepest covenant and mercy let not all the trouble seem little before thee that hath come upon us on our kings on our princes and on our priests and on our prophets and on our fathers and on all thy people since the time of the kings of assyria unto this day 933 howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us for thou hast done right but we have done wickedly 934 neither have our kings our princes our priests nor our fathers kept thy law nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou didst testify against them 935 for they have not served thee in their kingdom and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them neither turned they from their wicked works 936 behold we are servants this day and for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof behold we are servants in it 937 and it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins also they have dominion over our bodies and over our cattle at their pleasure and we are in great distress 938 and because of all this we make a sure covenant and write it and our princes levites and priests seal unto it 101 now those that sealed were nehemiah

the commandments of the lord our lord and his judgments and his statutes 1030 and that we would not give our daughters unto the people of the land not take their daughters for our sons 1031 and if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on the sabbath day to sell that we would not buy it of them on the sabbath or on the holy day and that we would leave the seventh year and the exaction of every debt 1032 also we made ordinances for us to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our god 1033 for the shewbread and for the continual meat

the chambers of the house of our god and the tithes of our ground unto the levites that the same levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage 1038 and the priest the son of aaron shall be with the levites when the levites take tithes and the levites shall bring up the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our god to the chambers into the treasure house 1039 for the children of israel and the children of levi shall bring the offering of the corn of the new wine and the oil unto the chambers where are the vessels of the sanctuary and the priests that minister and the porters

into the congregation of god for ever 132 because they met not the children of israel with bread and with water but hired balaam against them that he should curse them howbeit our god turned the curse into a blessing 133 now it came to pass when they had heard the law that they separated from israel all the mixed multitude 134 and before this eliashib the priest having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our god was allied unto tobiah 135 and he had prepared for him a great chamber where aforetime they laid the meat offerings the frankincense and the vessels and the tithes of the corn the new wine and the oil which was commanded to be given to the levites and the singers and the porters and the offerings of the priests 136 but in all this time was not i at jerusalem for in the two and thirtieth year of artaxerxes king of babylon came i unto the king and after certain days obtained i leave of the king 137 and i came to jerusalem and understood of the evil that eliashib did for tobiah in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of god 138 and it grieved me sore therefore i cast forth all the household stuff to tobiah out of the chamber 139 then i commanded and they cleansed the chambers and thither brought i again the vessels of the house of god with the meat offering and the frankincense 1310 and i perceived that the portions of the levites had not been given them for the levites and the singers that did the work were fled every one to his field 1311 then contended i with the rulers and said why is the house of god forsaken and i gathered them together and set them in their place 1312 then brought all judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries 1313 and i made treasurers over the treasuries shelemiah the priest and zadok the scribe and of the levites pedaiah and next to them was hanan the son of zaccur the son of mattaniah for they were counted faithful and their office was to distribute unto their brethren 1314 remember me o my god concerning this and wipe not out my good deeds that i have done for the house of my god and for the offices thereof 1315 in those days saw i in judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath and bringing in sheaves and lading asses as also wine grapes and figs and all manner of burdens which they brought into jerusalem on the sabbath day and i testified against them in the day wherein they sold victuals 1316 there dwelt men of tyre also therein which brought fish and all manner of ware and sold on the sabbath unto the children of judah and in jerusalem 1317 then i contended with the nobles of judah and said unto them what evil thing is this that ye do and profane the sabbath day 1318 did not your fathers thus and did not our god bring all this evil upon us and upon this city yet ye bring more wrath upon israel by profaning the sabbath 1319 and it came to pass that when the gates of jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath i commanded that the gates should be shut and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath and some of my servants set i at the gates that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day 1320 so the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without jerusalem once or twice 1321 then i testified against them and said unto them why lodge ye about the wall if ye do so again i will lay hands on you from that time forth came they no more on the sabbath 1322 and i commanded the levites that they should cleanse themselves and that they should come and keep the gates to sanctify the sabbath day remember me o my god concerning this also and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy 1323 in those days also saw i jews that had married wives of ashdod of ammon and of moab 1324 and their children spake half in the speech of ashdod and could not speak in the jews language but according to the language of each people 1325 and i contended with them and cursed them and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair and made them swear by god saying ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons nor take their daughters unto your sons or for yourselves 1326 did not solomon king of israel sin by these things yet among many nations was there no king like him who was beloved of his god and god made him king over all israel nevertheless even him did outlandish women cause to sin 1327 shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil to transgress against our god in marrying strange wives 1328 and one of the sons of joiada the son of eliashib the high priest was son in law to sanballat the horonite therefore i chased him from me 1329 remember them o my god because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the levites 1330 thus cleansed i them from all strangers and appointed the wards of the priests and the levites every one in his business 1331 and for the wood offering at times appointed and for the firstfruits remember me o my god for good the book of esther 11 now it came to pass in the days of ahasuerus this is ahasuerus which reigned from india even unto ethiopia over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces 12 that in those days when the king ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shushan the palace 13 in the third year of his reign he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants the power of persia and media the nobles and princes of the provinces being before him 14 when he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days even an hundred and fourscore days 15 and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shushan the palace both unto great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the kings palace 16 where were white green and blue hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble the beds were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble 17 and they gave them drink in vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another and royal wine in abundance according to the state of the king 18 and the drinking was according to the law none did compel for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to every mans pleasure 19 also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king ahasuerus 110 on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine he commanded mehuman biztha harbona bigtha and abagtha zethar and carcas the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of ahasuerus the king 111 to bring vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal to shew the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look on 112 but the queen vashti refused to come at the kings commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very wroth and his anger burned in him 113 then the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so was the kings manner toward all that knew law and judgment 114 and the next unto him was carshena shethar admatha tarshish meres marsena and memucan the seven princes of persia and media which saw the kings face and which sat the first in the kingdom 115 what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to law because she hath not performed the commandment of the king ahasuerus by the chamberlains 116 and memucan answered before the king and the princes vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus 117 for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be reported the king ahasuerus commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him but she came not 118 likewise shall the ladies of persia and media say this day unto all the kings princes which have heard of the deed of the queen thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath 119 if it please the king let there go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the persians and the medes that it be not altered that vashti come no more before king ahasuerus and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she 120 and when the kings decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire for it is great all the wives shall give to their husbands honour both to great and small 121 and the saying pleased the king and the princes and the king did according to the word of memucan 122 for he sent letters into all the kings provinces into every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every people 21 after these things when the wrath of king ahasuerus was appeased he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her 22 then said the kings servants that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king 23 and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto shushan the palace to the house of the women unto the custody of hege the kings chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them 24 and let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of vashti and the thing pleased the king and he did so 25 now in shushan the palace there was a certain jew whose name was mordecai the son of jair the son of shimei the son of kish a benjamite 26 who had been carried away from jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with jeconiah king of judah whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away 27 and he brought up hadassah that is esther his uncles daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter 28 so it came to pass when the kings commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushan the palace to the custody of hegai that esther was brought also unto the kings house to the custody of hegai keeper of the women 29 and the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her her things for purification with such things as belonged to her and seven maidens which were meet to be given her out of the kings house and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women 210 esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred for mordecai had charged her that she should not shew it 211 and mordecai walked every day before the court of the womens house to know how esther did and what should become of her 212 now when every maids turn was come to go in to king ahasuerus after that she had been twelve months according to the manner of the women for so were the days of their purifications accomplished to wit six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odours and with other things for the purifying of the women 213 then thus came every maiden unto the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the kings house 214 in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women to the custody of shaashgaz the kings chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighted in her and that she were called by name 215 now when the turn of esther the daughter of abihail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what hegai the kings chamberlain the keeper of the women appointed and esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her 216 so esther was taken unto king ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month which is the month tebeth in the seventh year of his reign 217 and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti 218 then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants even esthers feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the state of the king 219 and when the virgins were gathered together the second time then mordecai sat in the kings gate 220 esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people as mordecai had charged her for esther did the commandment of mordecai like as when she was brought up with him 221 in those days while mordecai sat in the kings gate two of the kings chamberlains bigthan and teresh of those which kept the door were wroth and sought to lay hands on the king ahasuerus 222 and the thing was known to mordecai who told it unto esther the queen and esther certified the king thereof in mordecais name 223 and when inquisition was made of the matter it was found out therefore they were both hanged on a tree and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king 31 after these things did king ahasuerus promote haman the son of hammedatha the agagite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him 32 and all the kings servants that were in the kings gate bowed and reverenced haman for the king had so commanded concerning him but mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence 33 then the kings servants which were in the kings gate said unto mordecai why transgressest thou the kings commandment 34 now it came to pass when they spake daily unto him and he hearkened not unto them that they told haman to see whether mordecais matters would stand for he had told them that he was a jew 35 and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence then was haman full of wrath 36 and he thought scorn to lay hands on mordecai alone for they had shewed him the people of mordecai wherefore haman sought to destroy all the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of ahasuerus even the people of mordecai 37 in the first month that is the month nisan in the twelfth year of king ahasuerus they cast pur that is the lot before haman from day to day and from month to month to the twelfth month that is the month adar 38 and haman said unto king ahasuerus there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom and their laws are diverse from all people neither keep they the kings laws therefore it is not for the kings profit to suffer them 39 if it please the king let it be written that they may be destroyed and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business to bring it into the kings treasuries 310 and the king took his ring from his hand and gave it unto haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the jews enemy 311 and the king said unto haman the silver is given to thee the people also to do with them as it seemeth good to thee 312 then were the kings scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month and there was written according to all that haman had commanded unto the kings lieutenants and to the governors that were over every province and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language in the name of king ahasuerus was it written and sealed with the kings ring 313 and the letters were sent by posts into all the kings provinces to destroy to kill and to cause to perish all jews both young and old little children and women in one day even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar and to take the spoil of them for a prey 314 the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people that they should be ready against that day 315 the posts went out being hastened by the kings commandment and the decree was given in shushan the palace and the king and haman sat down to drink but the city shushan was perplexed 41 when mordecai perceived all that was done mordecai rent his clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out into the midst of the city and cried with a loud and a bitter cry 42 and came even before the kings gate for none might enter into the kings gate clothed with sackcloth 43 and in every province whithersoever the kings commandment and his decree came there was great mourning among the jews and fasting and weeping and wailing and many lay in sackcloth and ashes 44 so esthers maids and her chamberlains came and told it her then was the queen exceedingly grieved and she sent raiment to clothe mordecai and to take away his sackcloth from him but he received it not 45 then called esther for hatach one of the kings chamberlains whom he had appointed to attend upon her and gave him a commandment to mordecai to know what it was and why it was 46 so hatach went forth to mordecai unto the street of the city which was before the kings gate 47 and mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him and of the sum of the money that haman had promised to pay to the kings treasuries for the jews to destroy them 48 also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at shushan to destroy them to shew it unto esther and to declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him and to make request before him for her people 49 and hatach came and told esther the words of mordecai 410 again esther spake unto hatach and gave him commandment unto mordecai 411 all the kings servants and the people of the kings provinces do know that whosoever whether man or women shall come unto the king into the inner court who is not called there is one law of his to put him to death except such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre that he may live but i have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days 412 and they told to mordecai esthers words 413 then mordecai commanded to answer esther think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the kings house more than all the jews 414 for if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the jews from another place but thou and thy fathers house shall be destroyed and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this 415 then esther bade them return mordecai this answer 416 go gather together all the jews that are present in shushan and fast ye for me and neither eat nor drink three days night or day i also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will i go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if i perish i perish 417 so mordecai went his way and did according to all that esther had commanded him 51 now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on her royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the kings house over against the kings house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house 52 and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favour in his sight and the king held out to esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand so esther drew near and touched the top of the sceptre 53 then said the king unto her what wilt thou queen esther and what is thy request it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom 54 and esther answered if it seem good unto the king let the king and haman come this day unto the banquet that i have prepared for him 55 then the king said cause haman to make haste that he may do as esther hath said so the king and haman came to the banquet that esther had prepared 56 and the king said unto esther at the banquet of wine what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed 57 then answered esther and said my petition and my request is 58 if i have found favour in the sight of the king and if it please the king to grant my petition and to perform my request let the king and haman come to the banquet that i shall prepare for them and i will do to morrow as the king hath said 59 then went haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart but when haman saw mordecai in the kings gate that he stood not up nor moved for him he was full of indignation against mordecai 510 nevertheless haman refrained himself and when he came home he sent and called for his friends and zeresh his wife 511 and haman told them of the glory of his riches and the multitude of his children and all the things wherein the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king 512 haman said moreover yea esther the queen did let no man come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself and to morrow am i invited unto her also with the king 513 yet all this availeth me nothing so long as i see mordecai the jew sitting at the kings gate 514 then said zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high and to morrow speak thou unto the king that mordecai may be hanged thereon then go thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet and the thing pleased haman and he caused the gallows to be made 61 on that night could not the king sleep and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles and they were read before the king 62 and it was found written that mordecai had told of bigthana and teresh two of the kings chamberlains the keepers of the door who sought to lay hand on the king ahasuerus 63 and the king said what honour and dignity hath been done to mordecai for this then said the kings servants that ministered unto him there is nothing done for him 64 and the king said who is in the court now haman was come into the outward court of the kings house to speak unto the king to hang mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him 65 and the kings servants said unto him behold haman standeth in the court and the king said let him come in 66 so haman came in and the king said unto him what shall be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour now haman thought in his heart to whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself 67 and haman answered the king for the man whom the king delighteth to honour 68 let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear and the horse that the king rideth upon and the crown royal which is set upon his head 69 and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the kings most noble princes that they may array the man withal whom the king delighteth to honour and bring him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaim before him thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth to honour 610 then the king said to haman make haste and take the apparel and the horse as thou hast said and do even so to mordecai the jew that sitteth at the kings gate let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken 611 then took haman the apparel and the horse and arrayed mordecai and brought him on horseback through the street of the city and proclaimed before him thus shall it be done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour 612 and mordecai came again to the kings gate but haman hasted to his house mourning and having his head covered 613 and haman told zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing that had befallen him then said his wise men and zeresh his wife unto him if mordecai be of the seed of the jews before whom thou hast begun to fall thou shalt not prevail against him but shalt surely fall before him 614 and while they were yet talking with him came the kings chamberlains and hasted to bring haman unto the banquet that esther had prepared 71 so the king and haman came to banquet with esther the queen 72 and the king said again unto esther on the second day at the banquet of wine what is thy petition queen esther and it shall be granted thee and what is thy request and it shall be performed even to the half of the kingdom 73 then esther the queen answered and said if i have found favour in thy sight o king and if it please the king let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request 74 for we are sold i and my people to be destroyed to be slain and to perish but if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen i had held my tongue although the enemy could not countervail the kings damage 75 then the king ahasuerus answered and said unto esther the queen who is he and where is he that durst presume in his heart to do so 76 and esther said the adversary and enemy is this wicked haman then haman was afraid before the king and the queen 77 and the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden and haman stood up to make request for his life to esther the queen for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king 78 then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine and haman was fallen upon the bed whereon esther was then said the king will he force the queen also before me in the house as the word went out of kings mouth they covered hamans face 79 and harbonah one of the chamberlains said before the king behold also the gallows fifty cubits high which haman had made for mordecai who spoken good for the king standeth in the house of haman then the king said hang him thereon 710 so they hanged haman on the gallows that he had prepared for mordecai then was the kings wrath pacified 81 on that day did the king ahasuerus give the house of haman the jews enemy unto esther the queen and mordecai came before the king for esther had told what he was unto her 82 and the king took off his ring which he had taken from haman and gave it unto mordecai and esther set mordecai over the house of haman 83 and esther spake yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the mischief of haman the agagite and his device that he had devised against the jews 84 then the king held out the golden sceptre toward esther so esther arose and stood before the king 85 and said if it please the king and if i have favour in his sight and the thing seem right before the king and i be pleasing in his eyes let it be written to reverse the letters devised by haman the son of hammedatha the agagite which he wrote to destroy the jews which are in all the kings provinces 86 for how can i endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people or how can i endure to see the destruction of my kindred 87 then the king ahasuerus said unto esther the queen and to mordecai the jew behold i have given esther the house of haman and him they have hanged upon the gallows because he laid his hand upon the jews 88 write ye also for the jews as it liketh you in the kings name and seal it with the kings ring for the writing which is written in the kings name and sealed with the kings ring may no man reverse 89 then were the kings scribes called at that time in the third month that is the month sivan on the three and twentieth day thereof and it was written according to all that mordecai commanded unto the jews and to the lieutenants and the deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from india unto ethiopia an hundred twenty and seven provinces unto every province according to the writing thereof and unto every people after their language and to the jews according to their writing and according to their language 810 and he wrote in the king ahasuerus name and sealed it with the kings ring and sent letters by posts on horseback and riders on mules camels and young dromedaries 811 wherein the king granted the jews which were in every city to gather themselves together and to stand for their life to destroy to slay and to cause to perish all the power of the people and province that would assault them both little ones and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey 812 upon one day in all the provinces of king ahasuerus namely upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month which is the month adar 813 the copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was published unto all people and that the jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their enemies 814 so the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out being hastened and pressed on by the kings commandment and the decree was given at shushan the palace 815 and mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a garment of fine linen and purple and the city of shushan rejoiced and was glad 816 the jews had light and gladness and joy and honour 817 and in every province and in every city whithersoever the kings commandment and his decree came the jews had joy and gladness a feast and a good day and many of the people of the land became jews for the fear of the jews fell upon them 91 now in the twelfth month that is the month adar on the thirteenth day of the same when the kings commandment and his decree drew near to be put in execution in the day that the enemies of the jews hoped to have power over them though it was turned to the contrary that the jews had rule over them that hated them 92 the jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of the king ahasuerus to lay hand on such as sought their hurt and no man could withstand them for the fear of them fell upon all people 93 and all the rulers of the provinces and the lieutenants and the deputies and officers of the king helped the jews because the fear of mordecai fell upon them 94 for mordecai was great in the kings house and his fame went out throughout all the provinces for this man mordecai waxed greater and greater 95 thus the jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would unto those that hated them 96 and in shushan the palace the jews slew and destroyed five hundred men 97 and parshandatha and dalphon and aspatha 98 and poratha and adalia and aridatha 99 and parmashta and arisai and aridai and vajezatha 910 the ten sons of haman the son of hammedatha the enemy of the jews slew they but on the spoil laid they not their hand 911 on that day the number of those that were slain in shushan the palace was brought before the king 912 and the king said unto esther the queen the jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in shushan the palace and the ten sons of haman what have they done in the rest of the kings provinces now what is thy petition and it shall be granted thee or what is thy request further and it shall be done 913 then said esther if it please the king let it be granted to the jews which are in shushan to do to morrow also according unto this days decree and let hamans ten sons be hanged upon the gallows 914 and the king commanded it so to be done and the decree was given at shushan and they hanged hamans ten sons 915 for the jews that were in shushan gathered themselves together on the fourteenth day also of the month adar and slew three hundred men at shushan but on the prey they laid not their hand 916 but the other jews that were in the kings provinces gathered themselves together and stood for their lives and had rest from their enemies and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand but they laid not their hands on the prey 917 on the thirteenth day of the month adar and on the fourteenth day of the same rested they and made it a day of feasting and gladness 918 but the jews that were at shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof and on the fourteenth thereof and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of feasting and gladness 919 therefore the jews of the villages that dwelt in the unwalled towns made the fourteenth day of the month adar a day of gladness and feasting and a good day and of sending portions one to another 920 and mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the jews that were in all the provinces of the king ahasuerus both nigh and far 921 to stablish this among them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month adar and the fifteenth day of the same yearly 922 as the days wherein the jews rested from their enemies and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy and from mourning into a good day that they should make them days of feasting and joy and of sending portions one to another and gifts to the poor 923 and the jews undertook to do as they had begun and as mordecai had written unto them 924 because haman the son of hammedatha the agagite the enemy of all the jews had devised against the jews to destroy them and had cast pur that is the lot to consume them and to destroy them 925 but when esther came before the king he commanded by letters that his wicked device which he devised against the jews should return upon his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows 926 wherefore they called these days purim after the name of pur therefore for all the words of this letter and of that which they had seen concerning this matter and which had come unto them 927 the jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon all such as joined themselves unto them so as it should not fail that they would keep these two days according to their writing and according to their appointed time every year 928 and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation every family every province and every city and that these days of purim should not fail from among the jews nor the memorial of them perish from their seed 929 then esther the queen the daughter of abihail and mordecai the jew wrote with all authority to confirm this second letter of purim 930 and he sent the letters unto all the jews to the hundred twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of ahasuerus with words of peace and truth 931 to confirm these days of purim in their times appointed according as mordecai the jew and esther the queen had enjoined them and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed the matters of the fastings and their cry 932 and the decree of esther confirmed these matters of purim and it was written in the book 101 and the king ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land and upon the isles of the sea 102 and all the acts of his power and of his might and the declaration of the greatness of mordecai whereunto the king advanced him are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of media and persia 103 for mordecai the jew was next unto king ahasuerus and great among the jews and accepted of the multitude of his brethren seeking the wealth of his people and speaking peace to all his seed the book of job 11 there was a man in the land of uz whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared god and eschewed evil 12 and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters 13 his substance also was seven thousand sheep and three thousand camels and five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred she asses and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east 14 and his sons went and feasted in their houses every one his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them 15 and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their hearts thus did job continually 16 now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them 17 and the lord said unto satan whence comest thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it 18 and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and escheweth evil 19 then satan answered the lord and said doth job fear god for nought 110 hast not thou made an hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side thou hast blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land 111 but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to thy face 112 and the lord said unto satan behold all that he hath is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so satan went forth from the presence of the lord 113 and there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house 114 and there came a messenger unto job and said the oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them 115 and the sabeans fell upon them and took them away yea they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee 116 while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the fire of god is fallen from heaven and hath burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and i only am escaped alone to tell thee 117 while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the chaldeans made out three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away yea and slain the servants with the edge of the sword and i only am escaped alone to tell thee 118 while he was yet speaking there came also another and said thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brothers house 119 and behold there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and they are dead and i only am escaped alone to tell thee 120 then job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped 121 and said naked came i out of my mothers womb and naked shall i return thither the lord gave and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord 122 in all this job sinned not nor charged god foolishly 21 again there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them to present himself before the lord 22 and the lord said unto satan from whence comest thou and satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it 23 and the lord said unto satan hast thou considered my servant job that there is none like him in the earth a perfect and an upright man one that feareth god and escheweth evil and still he holdeth fast his integrity although thou movedst me against him to destroy him without cause 24 and satan answered the lord and said skin for skin yea all that a man hath will he give for his life 25 but put forth thine hand now and touch his bone and his flesh and he will curse thee to thy face 26 and the lord said unto satan behold he is in thine hand but save his life 27 so went satan forth from the presence of the lord and smote job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown 28 and he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal and he sat down among the ashes 29 then said his wife unto him dost thou still retain thine integrity curse god and die 210 but he said unto her thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh what shall we receive good at the hand of god and shall we not receive evil in all this did not job sin with his lips 211 now when jobs three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him they came every one from his own place eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him 212 and when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not they lifted up their voice and wept and they rent every one his mantle and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven 213 so they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights and none spake a word unto him for they saw that his grief was very great 31 after this opened job his mouth and cursed his day 32 and job spake and said 33 let the day perish wherein i was born and the night in which it was said there is a man child conceived 34 let that day be darkness let not god regard it from above neither let the light shine upon it 35 let darkness and the shadow of death stain it let a cloud dwell upon it let the blackness of the day terrify it 36 as for that night let darkness seize upon it let it not be joined unto the days of the year let it not come into the number of the months 37 lo let that night be solitary let no joyful voice come therein 38 let them curse it that curse the day who are ready to raise up their mourning 39 let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark let it look for light but have none neither let it see the dawning of the day 310 because it shut not up the doors of my mothers womb nor hid sorrow from mine eyes 311 why died i not from the womb why did i not give up the ghost when i came out of the belly 312 why did the knees prevent me or why the breasts that i should suck 313 for now should i have lain still and been quiet i should have slept then had i been at rest 314 with kings and counsellors of the earth which build desolate places for themselves 315 or with princes that had gold who filled their houses with silver 316 or as an hidden untimely birth i had not been as infants which never saw light 317 there the wicked cease from troubling and there the weary be at rest 318 there the prisoners rest together they hear not the voice of the oppressor 319 the small and great are there and the servant is free from his master 320 wherefore is light given to him that is in misery and life unto the bitter in soul 321 which long for death but it cometh not and dig for it more than for hid treasures 322 which rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave 323 why is light given to a man whose way is hid and whom god hath hedged in 324 for my sighing cometh before i eat and my roarings are poured out like the waters 325 for the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me and that which i was afraid of is come unto me 326 i was not in safety neither had i rest neither was i quiet yet trouble came 41 then eliphaz the temanite answered and said 42 if we assay to commune with thee wilt thou be grieved but who can withhold himself from speaking 43 behold thou hast instructed many and thou hast strengthened the weak hands 44 thy words have upholden him that was falling and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees 45 but now it is come upon thee and thou faintest it toucheth thee and thou art troubled 46 is not this thy fear thy confidence thy hope and the uprightness of thy ways 47 remember i pray thee who ever perished being innocent or where were the righteous cut off 48 even as i have seen they that plow iniquity and sow wickedness reap the same 49 by the blast of god they perish and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed 410 the roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion and the teeth of the young lions are broken 411 the old lion perisheth for lack of prey and the stout lions whelps are scattered abroad 412 now a thing was secretly brought to me and mine ear received a little thereof 413 in thoughts from the visions of the night when deep sleep falleth on men 414 fear came upon me and trembling which made all my bones to shake 415 then a spirit passed before my face the hair of my flesh stood up 416 it stood still but i could not discern the form thereof an image was before mine eyes there was silence and i heard a voice saying 417 shall mortal man be more just than god shall a man be more pure than his maker 418 behold he put no trust in his servants and his angels he charged with folly 419 how much less in them that dwell in houses of clay whose foundation is in the dust which are crushed before the moth 420 they are destroyed from morning to evening they perish for ever without any regarding it 421 doth not their excellency which is in them go away they die even without wisdom 51 call now if there be any that will answer thee and to which of the saints wilt thou turn 52 for wrath killeth the foolish man and envy slayeth the silly one 53 i have seen the foolish taking root but suddenly i cursed his habitation 54 his children are far from safety and they are crushed in the gate neither is there any to deliver them 55 whose harvest the hungry eateth up and taketh it even out of the thorns and the robber swalloweth up their substance 56 although affliction cometh not forth of the dust neither doth trouble spring out of the ground 57 yet man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward 58 i would seek unto god and unto god would i commit my cause 59 which doeth great things and unsearchable marvellous things without number 510 who giveth rain upon the earth and sendeth waters upon the fields 511 to set up on high those that be low that those which mourn may be exalted to safety 512 he disappointeth the devices of the crafty so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise 513 he taketh the wise in their own craftiness and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong 514 they meet with darkness in the day time and grope in the noonday as in the night 515 but he saveth the poor from the sword from their mouth and from the hand of the mighty 516 so the poor hath hope and iniquity stoppeth her mouth 517 behold happy is the man whom god correcteth therefore despise not thou the chastening of the almighty 518 for he maketh sore and bindeth up he woundeth and his hands make whole 519 he shall deliver thee in six troubles yea in seven there shall no evil touch thee 520 in famine he shall redeem thee from death and in war from the power of the sword 521 thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh 522 at destruction and famine thou shalt laugh neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth 523 for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee 524 and thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace and thou shalt visit thy habitation and shalt not sin 525 thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great and thine offspring as the grass of the earth 526 thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season 527 lo this we have searched it so it is hear it and know thou it for thy good 61 but job answered and said 62 oh that my grief were throughly weighed and my calamity laid in the balances together 63 for now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea therefore my words are swallowed up 64 for the arrows of the almighty are within me the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit the terrors of god do set themselves in array against me 65 doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass or loweth the ox over his fodder 66 can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt or is there any taste in the white of an egg 67 the things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat 68 oh that i might have my request and that god would grant me the thing that i long for 69 even that it would please god to destroy me that he would let loose his hand and cut me off 610 then should i yet have comfort yea i would harden myself in sorrow let him not spare for i have not concealed the words of the holy one 611 what is my strength that i should hope and what is mine end that i should prolong my life 612 is my strength the strength of stones or is my flesh of brass 613 is not my help in me and is wisdom driven quite from me 614 to him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend but he forsaketh the fear of the almighty 615 my brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook and as the stream of brooks they pass away 616 which are blackish by reason of the ice and wherein the snow is hid 617 what time they wax warm they vanish when it is hot they are consumed out of their place 618 the paths of their way are turned aside they go to nothing and perish 619 the troops of tema looked the companies of sheba waited for them 620 they were confounded because they had hoped they came thither and were ashamed 621 for now ye are nothing ye see my casting down and are afraid 622 did i say bring unto me or give a reward for me of your substance 623 or deliver me from the enemys hand or redeem me from the hand of the mighty 624 teach me and i will hold my tongue and cause me to understand wherein i have erred 625 how forcible are right words but what doth your arguing reprove 626 do ye imagine to reprove words and the speeches of one that is desperate which are as wind 627 yea ye overwhelm the fatherless and ye dig a pit for your friend 628 now therefore be content look upon me for it is evident unto you if i lie 629 return i pray you let it not be iniquity yea return again my righteousness is in it 630 is there iniquity in my tongue cannot my taste discern perverse things 71 is there not an appointed time to man upon earth are not his days also like the days of an hireling 72 as a servant earnestly desireth the shadow and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work 73 so am i made to possess months of vanity and wearisome nights are appointed to me 74 when i lie down i say when shall i arise and the night be gone and i am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day 75 my flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust my skin is broken and become loathsome 76 my days are swifter than a weavers shuttle and are spent without hope 77 o remember that my life is wind mine eye shall no more see good 78 the eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more thine eyes are upon me and i am not 79 as the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more 710 he shall return no more to his house neither shall his place know him any more 711 therefore i will not refrain my mouth i will speak in the anguish of my spirit i will complain in the bitterness of my soul 712 am i a sea or a whale that thou settest a watch over me 713 when i say my bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my complaints 714 then thou scarest me with dreams and terrifiest me through visions 715 so that my soul chooseth strangling and death rather than my life 716 i loathe it i would not live alway let me alone for my days are vanity 717 what is man that thou shouldest magnify him and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him 718 and that thou shouldest visit him every morning and try him every moment 719 how long wilt thou not depart from me nor let me alone till i swallow down my spittle 720 i have sinned what shall i do unto thee o thou preserver of men why hast thou set me as a mark against thee so that i am a burden to myself 721 and why dost thou not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity for now shall i sleep in the dust and thou shalt seek me in the morning but i shall not be 81 then answered bildad the shuhite and said 82 how long wilt thou speak these things and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind 83 doth god pervert judgment or doth the almighty pervert justice 84 if thy children have sinned against him and he have cast them away for their transgression 85 if thou wouldest seek unto god betimes and make thy supplication to the almighty 86 if thou wert pure and upright surely now he would awake for thee and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous 87 though thy beginning was small yet thy latter end should greatly increase 88 for enquire i pray thee of the former age and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers 89 for we are but of yesterday and know nothing because our days upon earth are a shadow 810 shall not they teach thee and tell thee and utter words out of their heart 811 can the rush grow up without mire can the flag grow without water 812 whilst it is yet in his greenness and not cut down it withereth before any other herb 813 so are the paths of all that forget god and the hypocrites hope shall perish 814 whose hope shall be cut off and whose trust shall be a spiders web 815 he shall lean upon his house but it shall not stand he shall hold it fast but it shall not endure 816 he is green before the sun and his branch shooteth forth in his garden 817 his roots are wrapped about the heap and seeth the place of stones 818 if he destroy him from his place then it shall deny him saying i have not seen thee 819 behold this is the joy of his way and out of the earth shall others grow 820 behold god will not cast away a perfect man neither will he help the evil doers 821 till he fill thy mouth with laughing and thy lips with rejoicing 822 they that hate thee shall be clothed with shame and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought 91 then job answered and said 92 i know it is so of a truth but how should man be just with god 93 if he will contend with him he cannot answer him one of a thousand 94 he is wise in heart and mighty in strength who hath hardened himself against him and hath prospered 95 which removeth the mountains and they know not which overturneth them in his anger 96 which shaketh the earth out of her place and the pillars thereof tremble 97 which commandeth the sun and it riseth not and sealeth up the stars 98 which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea 99 which maketh arcturus orion and pleiades and the chambers of the south 910 which doeth great things past finding out yea and wonders without number 911 lo he goeth by me and i see him not he passeth on also but i perceive him not 912 behold he taketh away who can hinder him who will say unto him what doest thou 913 if god will not withdraw his anger the proud helpers do stoop under him 914 how much less shall i answer him and choose out my words to reason with him 915 whom though i were righteous yet would i not answer but i would make supplication to my judge 916 if i had called and he had answered me yet would i not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice 917 for he breaketh me with a tempest and multiplieth my wounds without cause 918 he will not suffer me to take my breath but filleth me with bitterness 919 if i speak of strength lo he is strong and if of judgment who shall set me a time to plead 920 if i justify myself mine own mouth shall condemn me if i say i am perfect it shall also prove me perverse 921 though i were perfect yet would i not know my soul i would despise my life 922 this is one thing therefore i said it he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked 923 if the scourge slay suddenly he will laugh at the trial of the innocent 924 the earth is given into the hand of the wicked he covereth the faces of the judges thereof if not where and who is he 925 now my days are swifter than a post they flee away they see no good 926 they are passed away as the swift ships as the eagle that hasteth to the prey 927 if i say i will forget my complaint i will leave off my heaviness and comfort myself 928 i am afraid of all my sorrows i know that thou wilt not hold me innocent 929 if i be wicked why then labour i in vain 930 if i wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so clean 931 yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch and mine own clothes shall abhor me 932 for he is not a man as i am that i should answer him and we should come together in judgment 933 neither is there any daysman betwixt us that might lay his hand upon us both 934 let him take his rod away from me and let not his fear terrify me 935 then would i speak and not fear him but it is not so with me 101 my soul is weary of my life i will leave my complaint upon myself i will speak in the bitterness of my soul 102 i will say unto god do not condemn me shew me wherefore thou contendest with me 103 is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands and shine upon the counsel of the wicked 104 hast thou eyes of flesh or seest thou as man seeth 105 are thy days as the days of man are thy years as mans days 106 that thou enquirest after mine iniquity and searchest after my sin 107 thou knowest that i am not wicked and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand 108 thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about yet thou dost destroy me 109 remember i beseech thee that thou hast made me as the clay and wilt thou bring me into dust again 1010 hast thou not poured me out as milk and curdled me like cheese 1011 thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh and hast fenced me with bones and sinews 1012 thou hast granted me life and favour and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit 1013 and these things hast thou hid in thine heart i know that this is with thee 1014 if i sin then thou markest me and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity 1015 if i be wicked woe unto me and if i be righteous yet will i not lift up my head i am full of confusion therefore see thou mine affliction 1016 for it increaseth thou huntest me as a fierce lion and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me 1017 thou renewest thy witnesses against me and increasest thine indignation upon me changes and war are against me 1018 wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb oh that i had given up the ghost and no eye had seen me 1019 i should have been as though i had not been i should have been carried from the womb to the grave 1020 are not my days few cease then and let me alone that i may take comfort a little 1021 before i go whence i shall not return even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death 1022 a land of darkness as darkness itself and of the shadow of death without any order and where the light is as darkness 111 then answered zophar the naamathite and said 112 should not the multitude of words be answered and should a man full of talk be justified 113 should thy lies make men hold their peace and when thou mockest shall no man make thee ashamed 114 for thou hast said my doctrine is pure and i am clean in thine eyes 115 but oh that god would speak and open his lips against thee 116 and that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom that they are double to that which is know therefore that god exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth 117 canst thou by searching find out god canst thou find out the almighty unto perfection 118 it is as high as heaven what canst thou do deeper than hell what canst thou know 119 the measure thereof is longer than the earth and broader than the sea 1110 if he cut off and shut up or gather together then who can hinder him 1111 for he knoweth vain men he seeth wickedness also will he not then consider it 1112 for vain men would be wise though man be born like a wild asss colt 1113 if thou prepare thine heart and stretch out thine hands toward him 1114 if iniquity be in thine hand put it far away and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles 1115 for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot yea thou shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear 1116 because thou shalt forget thy misery and remember it as waters that pass away 1117 and thine age shall be clearer than the noonday thou shalt shine forth thou shalt be as the morning 1118 and thou shalt be secure because there is hope yea thou shalt dig about thee and thou shalt take thy rest in safety 1119 also thou shalt lie down and none shall make thee afraid yea many shall make suit unto thee 1120 but the eyes of the wicked shall fail and they shall not escape and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost 121 and job answered and said 122 no doubt but ye are the people and wisdom shall die with you 123 but i have understanding as well as you i am not inferior to you yea who knoweth not such things as these 124 i am as one mocked of his neighbour who calleth upon god and he answereth him the just upright man is laughed to scorn 125 he that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease 126 the tabernacles of robbers prosper and they that provoke god are secure into whose hand god bringeth abundantly 127 but ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee and the fowls of the air and they shall tell thee 128 or speak to the earth and it shall teach thee and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee 129 who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the lord hath wrought this 1210 in whose hand is the soul of every living thing and the breath of all mankind 1211 doth not the ear try words and the mouth taste his meat 1212 with the ancient is wisdom and in length of days understanding 1213 with him is wisdom and strength he hath counsel and understanding 1214 behold he breaketh down and it cannot be built again he shutteth up a man and there can be no opening 1215 behold he withholdeth the waters and they dry up also he sendeth them out and they overturn the earth 1216 with him is strength and wisdom the deceived and the deceiver are his 1217 he leadeth counsellors away spoiled and maketh the judges fools 1218 he looseth the bond of kings and girdeth their loins with a girdle 1219 he leadeth princes away spoiled and overthroweth the mighty 1220 he removeth away the speech of the trusty and taketh away the understanding of the aged 1221 he poureth contempt upon princes and weakeneth the strength of the mighty 1222 he discovereth deep things out of darkness and bringeth out to light the shadow of death 1223 he increaseth the nations and destroyeth them he enlargeth the nations and straiteneth them again 1224 he taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way 1225 they grope in the dark without light and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man 131 lo mine eye hath seen all this mine ear hath heard and understood it 132 what ye know the same do i know also i am not inferior unto you 133 surely i would speak to the almighty and i desire to reason with god 134 but ye are forgers of lies ye are all physicians of no value 135 o that ye would altogether hold your peace and it should be your wisdom 136 hear now my reasoning and hearken to the pleadings of my lips 137 will ye speak wickedly for god and talk deceitfully for him 138 will ye accept his person will ye contend for god 139 is it good that he should search you out or as one man mocketh another do ye so mock him 1310 he will surely reprove you if ye do secretly accept persons 1311 shall not his excellency make you afraid and his dread fall upon you 1312 your remembrances are like unto ashes your bodies to bodies of clay 1313 hold your peace let me alone that i may speak and let come on me what will 1314 wherefore do i take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in mine hand 1315 though he slay me yet will i trust in him but i will maintain mine own ways before him 1316 he also shall be my salvation for an hypocrite shall not come before him 1317 hear diligently my speech and my declaration with your ears 1318 behold now i have ordered my cause i know that i shall be justified 1319 who is he that will plead with me for now if i hold my tongue i shall give up the ghost 1320 only do not two things unto me then will i not hide myself from thee 1321 withdraw thine hand far from me and let not thy dread make me afraid 1322 then call thou and i will answer or let me speak and answer thou me 1323 how many are mine iniquities and sins make me to know my transgression and my sin 1324 wherefore hidest thou thy face and holdest me for thine enemy 1325 wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble 1326 for thou writest bitter things against me and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth 1327 thou puttest my feet also in the stocks and lookest narrowly unto all my paths thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet 1328 and he as a rotten thing consumeth as a garment that is moth eaten 141 man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble 142 he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not 143 and doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one and bringest me into judgment with thee 144 who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean not one 145 seeing his days are determined the number of his months are with thee thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass 146 turn from him that he may rest till he shall accomplish as an hireling his day 147 for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again and that the tender branch thereof will not cease 148 though the root thereof wax old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground 149 yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a plant 1410 but man dieth and wasteth away yea man giveth up the ghost and where is he 1411 as the waters fail from the sea and the flood decayeth and drieth up 1412 so man lieth down and riseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep 1413 o that thou wouldest hide me in the grave that thou wouldest keep me secret until thy wrath be past that thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me 1414 if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come 1415 thou shalt call and i will answer thee thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands 1416 for now thou numberest my steps dost thou not watch over my sin 1417 my transgression is sealed up in a bag and thou sewest up mine iniquity 1418 and surely the mountains falling cometh to nought and the rock is removed out of his place 1419 the waters wear the stones thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth and thou destroyest the hope of man 1420 thou prevailest for ever against him and he passeth thou changest his countenance and sendest him away 1421 his sons come to honour and he knoweth it not and they are brought low but he perceiveth it not of them 1422 but his flesh upon him shall have pain and his soul within him shall mourn 151 then answered eliphaz the temanite and said 152 should a wise man utter vain knowledge and fill his belly with the east wind 153 should he reason with unprofitable talk or with speeches wherewith he can do no good 154 yea thou castest off fear and restrainest prayer before god 155 for thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty 156 thine own mouth condemneth thee and not i yea thine own lips testify against thee 157 art thou the first man that was born or wast thou made before the hills 158 hast thou heard the secret of god and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself 159 what knowest thou that we know not what understandest thou which is not in us 1510 with us are both the grayheaded and very aged men much elder than thy father 1511 are the consolations of god small with thee is there any secret thing with thee 1512 why doth thine heart carry thee away and what do thy eyes wink at 1513 that thou turnest thy spirit against god and lettest such words go out of thy mouth 1514 what is man that he should be clean and he which is born of a woman that he should be righteous 1515 behold he putteth no trust in his saints yea the heavens are not clean in his sight 1516 how much more abominable and filthy is man which drinketh iniquity like water 1517 i will shew thee hear me and that which i have seen i will declare 1518 which wise men have told from their fathers and have not hid it 1519 unto whom alone the earth was given and no stranger passed among them 1520 the wicked man travaileth with pain all his days and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor 1521 a dreadful sound is in his ears in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him 1522 he believeth not that he shall return out of darkness and he is waited for of the sword 1523 he wandereth abroad for bread saying where is it he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand 1524 trouble and anguish shall make him afraid they shall prevail against him as a king ready to the battle 1525 for he stretcheth out his hand against god and strengtheneth himself against the almighty 1526 he runneth upon him even on his neck upon the thick bosses of his bucklers 1527 because he covereth his face with his fatness and maketh collops of fat on his flanks 1528 and he dwelleth in desolate cities and in houses which no man inhabiteth which are ready to become heaps 1529 he shall not be rich neither shall his substance continue neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth 1530 he shall not depart out of darkness the flame shall dry up his branches and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away 1531 let not him that is deceived trust in vanity for vanity shall be his recompence 1532 it shall be accomplished before his time and his branch shall not be green 1533 he shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine and shall cast off his flower as the olive 1534 for the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery 1535 they conceive mischief and bring forth vanity and their belly prepareth deceit 161 then job answered and said 162 i have heard many such things miserable comforters are ye all 163 shall vain words have an end or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest 164 i also could speak as ye do if your soul were in my souls stead i could heap up words against you and shake mine head at you 165 but i would strengthen you with my mouth and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief 166 though i speak my grief is not asswaged and though i forbear what am i eased 167 but now he hath made me weary thou hast made desolate all my company 168 and thou hast filled me with wrinkles which is a witness against me and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face 169 he teareth me in his wrath who hateth me he gnasheth upon me with his teeth mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me 1610 they have gaped upon me with their mouth they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully they have gathered themselves together against me 1611 god hath delivered me to the ungodly and turned me over into the hands of the wicked 1612 i was at ease but he hath broken me asunder he hath also taken me by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark 1613 his archers compass me round about he cleaveth my reins asunder and doth not spare he poureth out my gall upon the ground 1614 he breaketh me with breach upon breach he runneth upon me like a giant 1615 i have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and defiled my horn in the dust 1616 my face is foul with weeping and on my eyelids is the shadow of death 1617 not for any injustice in mine hands also my prayer is pure 1618 o earth cover not thou my blood and let my cry have no place 1619 also now behold my witness is in heaven and my record is on high 1620 my friends scorn me but mine eye poureth out tears unto god 1621 o that one might plead for a man with god as a man pleadeth for his neighbour 1622 when a few years are come then i shall go the way whence i shall not return 171 my breath is corrupt my days are extinct the graves are ready for me 172 are there not mockers with me and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation 173 lay down now put me in a surety with thee who is he that will strike hands with me 174 for thou hast hid their heart from understanding therefore shalt thou not exalt them 175 he that speaketh flattery to his friends even the eyes of his children shall fail 176 he hath made me also a byword of the people and aforetime i was as a tabret 177 mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow and all my members are as a shadow 178 upright men shall be astonied at this and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite 179 the righteous also shall hold on his way and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger 1710 but as for you all do ye return and come now for i cannot find one wise man among you 1711 my days are past my purposes are broken off even the thoughts of my heart 1712 they change the night into day the light is short because of darkness 1713 if i wait the grave is mine house i have made my bed in the darkness 1714 i have said to corruption thou art my father to the worm thou art my mother and my sister 1715 and where is now my hope as for my hope who shall see it 1716 they shall go down to the bars of the pit when our rest together is in the dust 181 then answered bildad the shuhite and said 182 how long will it be ere ye make an end of words mark and afterwards we will speak 183 wherefore are we counted as beasts and reputed vile in your sight 184 he teareth himself in his anger shall the earth be forsaken for thee and shall the rock be removed out of his place 185 yea the light of the wicked shall be put out and the spark of his fire shall not shine 186 the light shall be dark in his tabernacle and his candle shall be put out with him 187 the steps of his strength shall be straitened and his own counsel shall cast him down 188 for he is cast into a net by his own feet and he walketh upon a snare 189 the gin shall take him by the heel and the robber shall prevail against him 1810 the snare is laid for him in the ground and a trap for him in the way 1811 terrors shall make him afraid on every side and shall drive him to his feet 1812 his strength shall be hungerbitten and destruction shall be ready at his side 1813 it shall devour the strength of his skin even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength 1814 his confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle and it shall bring him to the king of terrors 1815 it shall dwell in his tabernacle because it is none of his brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation 1816 his roots shall be dried up beneath and above shall his branch be cut off 1817 his remembrance shall perish from the earth and he shall have no name in the street 1818 he shall be driven from light into darkness and chased out of the world 1819 he shall neither have son nor nephew among his people nor any remaining in his dwellings 1820 they that come after him shall be astonied at his day as they that went before were affrighted 1821 surely such are the dwellings of the wicked and this is the place of him that knoweth not god 191 then job answered and said 192 how long will ye vex my soul and break me in pieces with words 193 these ten times have ye reproached me ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me 194 and be it indeed that i have erred mine error remaineth with myself 195 if indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me and plead against me my reproach 196 know now that god hath overthrown me and hath compassed me with his net 197 behold i cry out of wrong but i am not heard i cry aloud but there is no judgment 198 he hath fenced up my way that i cannot pass and he hath set darkness in my paths 199 he hath stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head 1910 he hath destroyed me on every side and i am gone and mine hope hath he removed like a tree 1911 he hath also kindled his wrath against me and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies 1912 his troops come together and raise up their way against me and encamp round about my tabernacle 1913 he hath put my brethren far from me and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me 1914 my kinsfolk have failed and my familiar friends have forgotten me 1915 they that dwell in mine house and my maids count me for a stranger i am an alien in their sight 1916 i called my servant and he gave me no answer i intreated him with my mouth 1917 my breath is strange to my wife though i intreated for the childrens sake of mine own body 1918 yea young children despised me i arose and they spake against me 1919 all my inward friends abhorred me and they whom i loved are turned against me 1920 my bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh and i am escaped with the skin of my teeth 1921 have pity upon me have pity upon me o ye my friends for the hand of god hath touched me 1922 why do ye persecute me as god and are not satisfied with my flesh 1923 oh that my words were now written oh that they were printed in a book 1924 that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever 1925 for i know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth 1926 and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall i see god 1927 whom i shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another though my reins be consumed within me 1928 but ye should say why persecute we him seeing the root of the matter is found in me 1929 be ye afraid of the sword for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword that ye may know there is a judgment 201 then answered zophar the naamathite and said 202 therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer and for this i make haste 203 i have heard the check of my reproach and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer 204 knowest thou not this of old since man was placed upon earth 205 that the triumphing of the wicked is short and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment 206 though his excellency mount up to the heavens and his head reach unto the clouds 207 yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung they which have seen him shall say where is he 208 he shall fly away as a dream and shall not be found yea he shall be chased away as a vision of the night 209 the eye also which saw him shall see him no more neither shall his place any more behold him 2010 his children shall seek to please the poor and his hands shall restore their goods 2011 his bones are full of the sin of his youth which shall lie down with him in the dust 2012 though wickedness be sweet in his mouth though he hide it under his tongue 2013 though he spare it and forsake it not but keep it still within his mouth 2014 yet his meat in his bowels is turned it is the gall of asps within him 2015 he hath swallowed down riches and he shall vomit them up again god shall cast them out of his belly 2016 he shall suck the poison of asps the vipers tongue shall slay him 2017 he shall not see the rivers the floods the brooks of honey and butter 2018 that which he laboured for shall he restore and shall not swallow it down according to his substance shall the restitution be and he shall not rejoice therein 2019 because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not 2020 surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly he shall not save of that which he desired 2021 there shall none of his meat be left therefore shall no man look for his goods 2022 in the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits every hand of the wicked shall come upon him 2023 when he is about to fill his belly god shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him while he is eating 2024 he shall flee from the iron weapon and the bow of steel shall strike him through 2025 it is drawn and cometh out of the body yea the glittering sword cometh out of his gall terrors are upon him 2026 all darkness shall be hid in his secret places a fire not blown shall consume him it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle 2027 the heaven shall reveal his iniquity and the earth shall rise up against him 2028 the increase of his house shall depart and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath 2029 this is the portion of a wicked man from god and the heritage appointed unto him by god 211 but job answered and said 212 hear diligently my speech and let this be your consolations 213 suffer me that i may speak and after that i have spoken mock on 214 as for me is my complaint to man and if it were so why should not my spirit be troubled 215 mark me and be astonished and lay your hand upon your mouth 216 even when i remember i am afraid and trembling taketh hold on my flesh 217 wherefore do the wicked live become old yea are mighty in power 218 their seed is established in their sight with them and their offspring before their eyes 219 their houses are safe from fear neither is the rod of god upon them 2110 their bull gendereth and faileth not their cow calveth and casteth not her calf 2111 they send forth their little ones like a flock and their children dance 2112 they take the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of the organ 2113 they spend their days in wealth and in a moment go down to the grave 2114 therefore they say unto god depart from us for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways 2115 what is the almighty that we should serve him and what profit should we have if we pray unto him 2116 lo their good is not in their hand the counsel of the wicked is far from me 2117 how oft is the candle of the wicked put out and how oft cometh their destruction upon them god distributeth sorrows in his anger 2118 they are as stubble before the wind and as chaff that the storm carrieth away 2119 god layeth up his iniquity for his children he rewardeth him and he shall know it 2120 his eyes shall see his destruction and he shall drink of the wrath of the almighty 2121 for what pleasure hath he in his house after him when the number of his months is cut off in the midst 2122 shall any teach god knowledge seeing he judgeth those that are high 2123 one dieth in his full strength being wholly at ease and quiet 2124 his breasts are full of milk and his bones are moistened with marrow 2125 and another dieth in the bitterness of his soul and never eateth with pleasure 2126 they shall lie down alike in the dust and the worms shall cover them 2127 behold i know your thoughts and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me 2128 for ye say where is the house of the prince and where are the dwelling places of the wicked 2129 have ye not asked them that go by the way and do ye not know their tokens 2130 that the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath 2131 who shall declare his way to his face and who shall repay him what he hath done 2132 yet shall he be brought to the grave and shall remain in the tomb 2133 the clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him and every man shall draw after him as there are innumerable before him 2134 how then comfort ye me in vain seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood 221 then eliphaz the temanite answered and said 222 can a man be profitable unto god as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself 223 is it any pleasure to the almighty that thou art righteous or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect 224 will he reprove thee for fear of thee will he enter with thee into judgment 225 is not thy wickedness great and thine iniquities infinite 226 for thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought and stripped the naked of their clothing 227 thou hast not given water to the weary to drink and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry 228 but as for the mighty man he had the earth and the honourable man dwelt in it 229 thou hast sent widows away empty and the arms of the fatherless have been broken 2210 therefore snares are round about thee and sudden fear troubleth thee 2211 or darkness that thou canst not see and abundance of waters cover thee 2212 is not god in the height of heaven and behold the height of the stars how high they are 2213 and thou sayest how doth god know can he judge through the dark cloud 2214 thick clouds are a covering to him that he seeth not and he walketh in the circuit of heaven 2215 hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden 2216 which were cut down out of time whose foundation was overflown with a flood 2217 which said unto god depart from us and what can the almighty do for them 2218 yet he filled their houses with good things but the counsel of the wicked is far from me 2219 the righteous see it and are glad and the innocent laugh them to scorn 2220 whereas our substance is not cut down but the remnant of them the fire consumeth 2221 acquaint now thyself with him and be at peace thereby good shall come unto thee 2222 receive i pray thee the law from his mouth and lay up his words in thine heart 2223 if thou return to the almighty thou shalt be built up thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles 2224 then shalt thou lay up gold as dust and the gold of ophir as the stones of the brooks 2225 yea the almighty shall be thy defence and thou shalt have plenty of silver 2226 for then shalt thou have thy delight in the almighty and shalt lift up thy face unto god 2227 thou shalt make thy prayer unto him and he shall hear thee and thou shalt pay thy vows 2228 thou shalt also decree a thing and it shall be established unto thee and the light shall shine upon thy ways 2229 when men are cast down then thou shalt say there is lifting up and he shall save the humble person 2230 he shall deliver the island of the innocent and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands 231 then job answered and said 232 even to day is my complaint bitter my stroke is heavier than my groaning 233 oh that i knew where i might find him that i might come even to his seat 234 i would order my cause before him and fill my mouth with arguments 235 i would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me 236 will he plead against me with his great power no but he would put strength in me 237 there the righteous might dispute with him so should i be delivered for ever from my judge 238 behold i go forward but he is not there and backward but i cannot perceive him 239 on the left hand where he doth work but i cannot behold him he hideth himself on the right hand that i cannot see him 2310 but he knoweth the way that i take when he hath tried me i shall come forth as gold 2311 my foot hath held his steps his way have i kept and not declined 2312 neither have i gone back from the commandment of his lips i have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food 2313 but he is in one mind and who can turn him and what his soul desireth even that he doeth 2314 for he performeth the thing that is appointed for me and many such things are with him 2315 therefore am i troubled at his presence when i consider i am afraid of him 2316 for god maketh my heart soft and the almighty troubleth me 2317 because i was not cut off before the darkness neither hath he covered the darkness from my face 241 why seeing times are not hidden from the almighty do they that know him not see his days 242 some remove the landmarks they violently take away flocks and feed thereof 243 they drive away the ass of the fatherless they take the widows ox for a pledge 244 they turn the needy out of the way the poor of the earth hide themselves together 245 behold as wild asses in the desert go they forth to their work rising betimes for a prey the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children 246 they reap every one his corn in the field and they gather the vintage of the wicked 247 they cause the naked to lodge without clothing that they have no covering in the cold 248 they are wet with the showers of the mountains and embrace the rock for want of a shelter 249 they pluck the fatherless from the breast and take a pledge of the poor 2410 they cause him to go naked without clothing and they take away the sheaf from the hungry 2411 which make oil within their walls and tread their winepresses and suffer thirst 2412 men groan from out of the city and the soul of the wounded crieth out yet god layeth not folly to them 2413 they are of those that rebel against the light they know not the ways thereof nor abide in the paths thereof 2414 the murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy and in the night is as a thief 2415 the eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight saying no eye shall see me and disguiseth his face 2416 in the dark they dig through houses which they had marked for themselves in the daytime they know not the light 2417 for the morning is to them even as the shadow of death if one know them they are in the terrors of the shadow of death 2418 he is swift as the waters their portion is cursed in the earth he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards 2419 drought and heat consume the snow waters so doth the grave those which have sinned 2420 the womb shall forget him the worm shall feed sweetly on him he shall be no more remembered and wickedness shall be broken as a tree 2421 he evil entreateth the barren that beareth not and doeth not good to the widow 2422 he draweth also the mighty with his power he riseth up and no man is sure of life 2423 though it be given him to be in safety whereon he resteth yet his eyes are upon their ways 2424 they are exalted for a little while but are gone and brought low they are taken out of the way as all other and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn 2425 and if it be not so now who will make me a liar and make my speech nothing worth 251 then answered bildad the shuhite and said 252 dominion and fear are with him he maketh peace in his high places 253 is there any number of his armies and upon whom doth not his light arise 254 how then can man be justified with god or how can he be clean that is born of a woman 255 behold even to the moon and it shineth not yea the stars are not pure in his sight 256 how much less man that is a worm and the son of man which is a worm 261 but job answered and said 262 how hast thou helped him that is without power how savest thou the arm that hath no strength 263 how hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is 264 to whom hast thou uttered words and whose spirit came from thee 265 dead things are formed from under the waters and the inhabitants thereof 266 hell is naked before him and destruction hath no covering 267 he stretcheth out the north over the empty place and hangeth the earth upon nothing 268 he bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds and the cloud is not rent under them 269 he holdeth back the face of his throne and spreadeth his cloud upon it 2610 he hath compassed the waters with bounds until the day and night come to an end 2611 the pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof 2612 he divideth the sea with his power and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud 2613 by his spirit he hath garnished the heavens his hand hath formed the crooked serpent 2614 lo these are parts of his ways but how little a portion is heard of him but the thunder of his power who can understand 271 moreover job continued his parable and said 272 as god liveth who hath taken away my judgment and the almighty who hath vexed my soul 273 all the while my breath is in me and the spirit of god is in my nostrils 274 my lips shall not speak wickedness nor my tongue utter deceit 275 god forbid that i should justify you till i die i will not remove mine integrity from me 276 my righteousness i hold fast and will not let it go my heart shall not reproach me so long as i live 277 let mine enemy be as the wicked and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous 278 for what is the hope of the hypocrite though he hath gained when god taketh away his soul 279 will god hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him 2710 will he delight himself in the almighty will he always call upon god 2711 i will teach you by the hand of god that which is with the almighty will i not conceal 2712 behold all ye yourselves have seen it why then are ye thus altogether vain 2713 this is the portion of a wicked man with god and the heritage of oppressors which they shall receive of the almighty 2714 if his children be multiplied it is for the sword and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread 2715 those that remain of him shall be buried in death and his widows shall not weep 2716 though he heap up silver as the dust and prepare raiment as the clay 2717 he may prepare it but the just shall put it on and the innocent shall divide the silver 2718 he buildeth his house as a moth and as a booth that the keeper maketh 2719 the rich man shall lie down but he shall not be gathered he openeth his eyes and he is not 2720 terrors take hold on him as waters a tempest stealeth him away in the night 2721 the east wind carrieth him away and he departeth and as a storm hurleth him out of his place 2722 for god shall cast upon him and not spare he would fain flee out of his hand 2723 men shall clap their hands at him and shall hiss him out of his place 281 surely there is a vein for the silver and a place for gold where they fine it 282 iron is taken out of the earth and brass is molten out of the stone 283 he setteth an end to darkness and searcheth out all perfection the stones of darkness and the shadow of death 284 the flood breaketh out from the inhabitant even the waters forgotten of the foot they are dried up they are gone away from men 285 as for the earth out of it cometh bread and under it is turned up as it were fire 286 the stones of it are the place of sapphires and it hath dust of gold 287 there is a path which no fowl knoweth and which the vultures eye hath not seen 288 the lions whelps have not trodden it nor the fierce lion passed by it 289 he putteth forth his hand upon the rock he overturneth the mountains by the roots 2810 he cutteth out rivers among the rocks and his eye seeth every precious thing 2811 he bindeth the floods from overflowing and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light 2812 but where shall wisdom be found and where is the place of understanding 2813 man knoweth not the price thereof neither is it found in the land of the living 2814 the depth saith it is not in me and the sea saith it is not with me 2815 it cannot be gotten for gold neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof 2816 it cannot be valued with the gold of ophir with the precious onyx or the sapphire 2817 the gold and the crystal cannot equal it and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold 2818 no mention shall be made of coral or of pearls for the price of wisdom is above rubies 2819 the topaz of ethiopia shall not equal it neither shall it be valued with pure gold 2820 whence then cometh wisdom and where is the place of understanding 2821 seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living and kept close from the fowls of the air 2822 destruction and death say we have heard the fame thereof with our ears 2823 god understandeth the way thereof and he knoweth the place thereof 2824 for he looketh to the ends of the earth and seeth under the whole heaven 2825 to make the weight for the winds and he weigheth the waters by measure 2826 when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder 2827 then did he see it and declare it he prepared it yea and searched it out 2828 and unto man he said behold the fear of the lord that is wisdom and to depart from evil is understanding 291 moreover job continued his parable and said 292 oh that i were as in months past as in the days when god preserved me 293 when his candle shined upon my head and when by his light i walked through darkness 294 as i was in the days of my youth when the secret of god was upon my tabernacle 295 when the almighty was yet with me when my children were about me 296 when i washed my steps with butter and the rock poured me out rivers of oil 297 when i went out to the gate through the city when i prepared my seat in the street 298 the young men saw me and hid themselves and the aged arose and stood up 299 the princes refrained talking and laid their hand on their mouth 2910 the nobles held their peace and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth 2911 when the ear heard me then it blessed me and when the eye saw me it gave witness to me 2912 because i delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless and him that had none to help him 2913 the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and i caused the widows heart to sing for joy 2914 i put on righteousness and it clothed me my judgment was as a robe and a diadem 2915 i was eyes to the blind and feet was i to the lame 2916 i was a father to the poor and the cause which i knew not i searched out 2917 and i brake the jaws of the wicked and plucked the spoil out of his teeth 2918 then i said i shall die in my nest and i shall multiply my days as the sand 2919 my root was spread out by the waters and the dew lay all night upon my branch 2920 my glory was fresh in me and my bow was renewed in my hand 2921 unto me men gave ear and waited and kept silence at my counsel 2922 after my words they spake not again and my speech dropped upon them 2923 and they waited for me as for the rain and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain 2924 if i laughed on them they believed it not and the light of my countenance they cast not down 2925 i chose out their way and sat chief and dwelt as a king in the army as one that comforteth the mourners 301 but now they that are younger than i have me in derision whose fathers i would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock 302 yea whereto might the strength of their hands profit me in whom old age was perished 303 for want and famine they were solitary fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste 304 who cut up mallows by the bushes and juniper roots for their meat 305 they were driven forth from among men they cried after them as after a thief 306 to dwell in the cliffs of the valleys in caves of the earth and in the rocks 307 among the bushes they brayed under the nettles they were gathered together 308 they were children of fools yea children of base men they were viler than the earth 309 and now am i their song yea i am their byword 3010 they abhor me they flee far from me and spare not to spit in my face 3011 because he hath loosed my cord and afflicted me they have also let loose the bridle before me 3012 upon my right hand rise the youth they push away my feet and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction 3013 they mar my path they set forward my calamity they have no helper 3014 they came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me 3015 terrors are turned upon me they pursue my soul as the wind and my welfare passeth away as a cloud 3016 and now my soul is poured out upon me the days of affliction have taken hold upon me 3017 my bones are pierced in me in the night season and my sinews take no rest 3018 by the great force of my disease is my garment changed it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat 3019 he hath cast me into the mire and i am become like dust and ashes 3020 i cry unto thee and thou dost not hear me i stand up and thou regardest me not 3021 thou art become cruel to me with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me 3022 thou liftest me up to the wind thou causest me to ride upon it and dissolvest my substance 3023 for i know that thou wilt bring me to death and to the house appointed for all living 3024 howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave though they cry in his destruction 3025 did not i weep for him that was in trouble was not my soul grieved for the poor 3026 when i looked for good then evil came unto me and when i waited for light there came darkness 3027 my bowels boiled and rested not the days of affliction prevented me 3028 i went mourning without the sun i stood up and i cried in the congregation 3029 i am a brother to dragons and a companion to owls 3030 my skin is black upon me and my bones are burned with heat 3031 my harp also is turned to mourning and my organ into the voice of them that weep 311 i made a covenant with mine eyes why then should i think upon a maid 312 for what portion of god is there from above and what inheritance of the almighty from on high 313 is not destruction to the wicked and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity 314 doth not he see my ways and count all my steps 315 if i have walked with vanity or if my foot hath hasted to deceit 316 let me be weighed in an even balance that god may know mine integrity 317 if my step hath turned out of the way and mine heart walked after mine eyes and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands 318 then let me sow and let another eat yea let my offspring be rooted out 319 if mine heart have been deceived by a woman or if i have laid wait at my neighbours door 3110 then let my wife grind unto another and let others bow down upon her 3111 for this is an heinous crime yea it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges 3112 for it is a fire that consumeth to destruction and would root out all mine increase 3113 if i did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant when they contended with me 3114 what then shall i do when god riseth up and when he visiteth what shall i answer him 3115 did not he that made me in the womb make him and did not one fashion us in the womb 3116 if i have withheld the poor from their desire or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail 3117 or have eaten my morsel myself alone and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof 3118 for from my youth he was brought up with me as with a father and i have guided her from my mothers womb 3119 if i have seen any perish for want of clothing or any poor without covering 3120 if his loins have not blessed me and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep 3121 if i have lifted up my hand against the fatherless when i saw my help in the gate 3122 then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade and mine arm be broken from the bone 3123 for destruction from god was a terror to me and by reason of his highness i could not endure 3124 if i have made gold my hope or have said to the fine gold thou art my confidence 3125 if i rejoice because my wealth was great and because mine hand had gotten much 3126 if i beheld the sun when it shined or the moon walking in brightness 3127 and my heart hath been secretly enticed or my mouth hath kissed my hand 3128 this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge for i should have denied the god that is above 3129 if i rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me or lifted up myself when evil found him 3130 neither have i suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul 3131 if the men of my tabernacle said not oh that we had of his flesh we cannot be satisfied 3132 the stranger did not lodge in the street but i opened my doors to the traveller 3133 if i covered my transgressions as adam by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom 3134 did i fear a great multitude or did the contempt of families terrify me that i kept silence and went not out of the door 3135 oh that one would hear me behold my desire is that the almighty would answer me and that mine adversary had written a book 3136 surely i would take it upon my shoulder and bind it as a crown to me 3137 i would declare unto him the number of my steps as a prince would i go near unto him 3138 if my land cry against me or that the furrows likewise thereof complain 3139 if i have eaten the fruits thereof without money or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life 3140 let thistles grow instead of wheat and cockle instead of barley the words of job are ended 321 so these three men ceased to answer job because he was righteous in his own eyes 322 then was kindled the wrath of elihu the son of barachel the buzite of the kindred of ram against job was his wrath kindled because he justified himself rather than god 323 also against his three friends was his wrath kindled because they had found no answer and yet had condemned job 324 now elihu had waited till job had spoken because they were elder than he 325 when elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men then his wrath was kindled 326 and elihu the son of barachel the buzite answered and said i am young and ye are very old wherefore i was afraid and durst not shew you mine opinion 327 i said days should speak and multitude of years should teach wisdom 328 but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding 329 great men are not always wise neither do the aged understand judgment 3210 therefore i said hearken to me i also will shew mine opinion 3211 behold i waited for your words i gave ear to your reasons whilst ye searched out what to say 3212 yea i attended unto you and behold there was none of you that convinced job or that answered his words 3213 lest ye should say we have found out wisdom god thrusteth him down not man 3214 now he hath not directed his words against me neither will i answer him with your speeches 3215 they were amazed they answered no more they left off speaking 3216 when i had waited for they spake not but stood still and answered no more 3217 i said i will answer also my part i also will shew mine opinion 3218 for i am full of matter the spirit within me constraineth me 3219 behold my belly is as wine which hath no vent it is ready to burst like new bottles 3220 i will speak that i may be refreshed i will open my lips and answer 3221 let me not i pray you accept any mans person neither let me give flattering titles unto man 3222 for i know not to give flattering titles in so doing my maker would soon take me away 331 wherefore job i pray thee hear my speeches and hearken to all my words 332 behold now i have opened my mouth my tongue hath spoken in my mouth 333 my words shall be of the uprightness of my heart and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly 334 the spirit of god hath made me and the breath of the almighty hath given me life 335 if thou canst answer me set thy words in order before me stand up 336 behold i am according to thy wish in gods stead i also am formed out of the clay 337 behold my terror shall not make thee afraid neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee 338 surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing and i have heard the voice of thy words saying 339 i am clean without transgression i am innocent neither is there iniquity in me 3310 behold he findeth occasions against me he counteth me for his enemy 3311 he putteth my feet in the stocks he marketh all my paths 3312 behold in this thou art not just i will answer thee that god is greater than man 3313 why dost thou strive against him for he giveth not account of any of his matters 3314 for god speaketh once yea twice yet man perceiveth it not 3315 in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falleth upon men in slumberings upon the bed 3316 then he openeth the ears of men and sealeth their instruction 3317 that he may withdraw man from his purpose and hide pride from man 3318 he keepeth back his soul from the pit and his life from perishing by the sword 3319 he is chastened also with pain upon his bed and the multitude of his bones with strong pain 3320 so that his life abhorreth bread and his soul dainty meat 3321 his flesh is consumed away that it cannot be seen and his bones that were not seen stick out 3322 yea his soul draweth near unto the grave and his life to the destroyers 3323 if there be a messenger with him an interpreter one among a thousand to shew unto man his uprightness 3324 then he is gracious unto him and saith deliver him from going down to the pit i have found a ransom 3325 his flesh shall be fresher than a childs he shall return to the days of his youth 3326 he shall pray unto god and he will be favourable unto him and he shall see his face with joy for he will render unto man his righteousness 3327 he looketh upon men and if any say i have sinned and perverted that which was right and it profited me not 3328 he will deliver his soul from going into the pit and his life shall see the light 3329 lo all these things worketh god oftentimes with man 3330 to bring back his soul from the pit to be enlightened with the light of the living 3331 mark well o job hearken unto me hold thy peace and i will speak 3332 if thou hast anything to say answer me speak for i desire to justify thee 3333 if not hearken unto me hold thy peace and i shall teach thee wisdom 341 furthermore elihu answered and said 342 hear my words o ye wise men and give ear unto me ye that have knowledge 343 for the ear trieth words as the mouth tasteth meat 344 let us choose to us judgment let us know among ourselves what is good 345 for job hath said i am righteous and god hath taken away my judgment 346 should i lie against my right my wound is incurable without transgression 347 what man is like job who drinketh up scorning like water 348 which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity and walketh with wicked men 349 for he hath said it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with god 3410 therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding far be it from god that he should do wickedness and from the almighty that he should commit iniquity 3411 for the work of a man shall he render unto him and cause every man to find according to his ways 3412 yea surely god will not do wickedly neither will the almighty pervert judgment 3413 who hath given him a charge over the earth or who hath disposed the whole world 3414 if he set his heart upon man if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath 3415 all flesh shall perish together and man shall turn again unto dust 3416 if now thou hast understanding hear this hearken to the voice of my words 3417 shall even he that hateth right govern and wilt thou condemn him that is most just 3418 is it fit to say to a king thou art wicked and to princes ye are ungodly 3419 how much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes nor regardeth the rich more than the poor for they all are the work of his hands 3420 in a moment shall they die and the people shall be troubled at midnight and pass away and the mighty shall be taken away without hand 3421 for his eyes are upon the ways of man and he seeth all his goings 3422 there is no darkness nor shadow of death where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves 3423 for he will not lay upon man more than right that he should enter into judgment with god 3424 he shall break in pieces mighty men without number and set others in their stead 3425 therefore he knoweth their works and he overturneth them in the night so that they are destroyed 3426 he striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others 3427 because they turned back from him and would not consider any of his ways 3428 so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him and he heareth the cry of the afflicted 3429 when he giveth quietness who then can make trouble and when he hideth his face who then can behold him whether it be done against a nation or against a man only 3430 that the hypocrite reign not lest the people be ensnared 3431 surely it is meet to be said unto god i have borne chastisement i will not offend any more 3432 that which i see not teach thou me if i have done iniquity i will do no more 3433 should it be according to thy mind he will recompense it whether thou refuse or whether thou choose and not i therefore speak what thou knowest 3434 let men of understanding tell me and let a wise man hearken unto me 3435 job hath spoken without knowledge and his words were without wisdom 3436 my desire is that job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men 3437 for he addeth rebellion unto his sin he clappeth his hands among us and multiplieth his words against god 351 elihu spake moreover and said 352 thinkest thou this to be right that thou saidst my righteousness is more than gods 353 for thou saidst what advantage will it be unto thee and what profit shall i have if i be cleansed from my sin 354 i will answer thee and thy companions with thee 355 look unto the heavens and see and behold the clouds which are higher than thou 356 if thou sinnest what doest thou against him or if thy transgressions be multiplied what doest thou unto him 357 if thou be righteous what givest thou him or what receiveth he of thine hand 358 thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art and thy righteousness may profit the son of man 359 by reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty 3510 but none saith where is god my maker who giveth songs in the night 3511 who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven 3512 there they cry but none giveth answer because of the pride of evil men 3513 surely god will not hear vanity neither will the almighty regard it 3514 although thou sayest thou shalt not see him yet judgment is before him therefore trust thou in him 3515 but now because it is not so he hath visited in his anger yet he knoweth it not in great extremity 3516 therefore doth job open his mouth in vain he multiplieth words without knowledge 361 elihu also proceeded and said 362 suffer me a little and i will shew thee that i have yet to speak on gods behalf 363 i will fetch my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my maker 364 for truly my words shall not be false he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee 365 behold god is mighty and despiseth not any he is mighty in strength and wisdom 366 he preserveth not the life of the wicked but giveth right to the poor 367 he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous but with kings are they on the throne yea he doth establish them for ever and they are exalted 368 and if they be bound in fetters and be holden in cords of affliction 369 then he sheweth them their work and their transgressions that they have exceeded 3610 he openeth also their ear to discipline and commandeth that they return from iniquity 3611 if they obey and serve him they shall spend their days in prosperity and their years in pleasures 3612 but if they obey not they shall perish by the sword and they shall die without knowledge 3613 but the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath they cry not when he bindeth them 3614 they die in youth and their life is among the unclean 3615 he delivereth the poor in his affliction and openeth their ears in oppression 3616 even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place where there is no straitness and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness 3617 but thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked judgment and justice take hold on thee 3618 because there is wrath beware lest he take thee away with his stroke then a great ransom cannot deliver thee 3619 will he esteem thy riches no not gold nor all the forces of strength 3620 desire not the night when people are cut off in their place 3621 take heed regard not iniquity for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction 3622 behold god exalteth by his power who teacheth like him 3623 who hath enjoined him his way or who can say thou hast wrought iniquity 3624 remember that thou magnify his work which men behold 3625 every man may see it man may behold it afar off 3626 behold god is great and we know him not neither can the number of his years be searched out 3627 for he maketh small the drops of water they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof 3628 which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly 3629 also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds or the noise of his tabernacle 3630 behold he spreadeth his light upon it and covereth the bottom of the sea 3631 for by them judgeth he the people he giveth meat in abundance 3632 with clouds he covereth the light and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt 3633 the noise thereof sheweth concerning it the cattle also concerning the vapour 371 at this also my heart trembleth and is moved out of his place 372 hear attentively the noise of his voice and the sound that goeth out of his mouth 373 he directeth it under the whole heaven and his lightning unto the ends of the earth 374 after it a voice roareth he thundereth with the voice of his excellency and he will not stay them when his voice is heard 375 god thundereth marvellously with his voice great things doeth he which we cannot comprehend 376 for he saith to the snow be thou on the earth likewise to the small rain and to the great rain of his strength 377 he sealeth up the hand of every man that all men may know his work 378 then the beasts go into dens and remain in their places 379 out of the south cometh the whirlwind and cold out of the north 3710 by the breath of god frost is given and the breadth of the waters is straitened 3711 also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud he scattereth his bright cloud 3712 and it is turned round about by his counsels that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth 3713 he causeth it to come whether for correction or for his land or for mercy 3714 hearken unto this o job stand still and consider the wondrous works of god 3715 dost thou know when god disposed them and caused the light of his cloud to shine 3716 dost thou know the balancings of the clouds the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge 3717 how thy garments are warm when he quieteth the earth by the south wind 3718 hast thou with him spread out the sky which is strong and as a molten looking glass 3719 teach us what we shall say unto him for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness 3720 shall it be told him that i speak if a man speak surely he shall be swallowed up 3721 and now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds but the wind passeth and cleanseth them 3722 fair weather cometh out of the north with god is terrible majesty 3723 touching the almighty we cannot find him out he is excellent in power and in judgment and in plenty of justice he will not afflict 3724 men do therefore fear him he respecteth not any that are wise of heart 381 then the lord answered job out of the whirlwind and said 382 who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge 383 gird up now thy loins like a man for i will demand of thee and answer thou me 384 where wast thou when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hast understanding 385 who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath stretched the line upon it 386 whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the corner stone thereof 387 when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy 388 or who shut up the sea with doors when it brake forth as if it had issued out of the womb 389 when i made the cloud the garment thereof and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it 3810 and brake up for it my decreed place and set bars and doors 3811 and said hitherto shalt thou come but no further and here shall thy proud waves be stayed 3812 hast thou commanded the morning since thy days and caused the dayspring to know his place 3813 that it might take hold of the ends of the earth that the wicked might be shaken out of it 3814 it is turned as clay to the seal and they stand as a garment 3815 and from the wicked their light is withholden and the high arm shall be broken 3816 hast thou entered into the springs of the sea or hast thou walked in the search of the depth 3817 have the gates of death been opened unto thee or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death 3818 hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth declare if thou knowest it all 3819 where is the way where light dwelleth and as for darkness where is the place thereof 3820 that thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof 3821 knowest thou it because thou wast then born or because the number of thy days is great 3822 hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail 3823 which i have reserved against the time of trouble against the day of battle and war 3824 by what way is the light parted which scattereth the east wind upon the earth 3825 who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters or a way for the lightning of thunder 3826 to cause it to rain on the earth where no man is on the wilderness wherein there is no man 3827 to satisfy the desolate and waste ground and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth 3828 hath the rain a father or who hath begotten the drops of dew 3829 out of whose womb came the ice and the hoary frost of heaven who hath gendered it 3830 the waters are hid as with a stone and the face of the deep is frozen 3831 canst thou bind the sweet influences of pleiades or loose the bands of orion 3832 canst thou bring forth mazzaroth in his season or canst thou guide arcturus with his sons 3833 knowest thou the ordinances of heaven canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth 3834 canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds that abundance of waters may cover thee 3835 canst thou send lightnings that they may go and say unto thee here we are 3836 who hath put wisdom in the inward parts or who hath given understanding to the heart 3837 who can number the clouds in wisdom or who can stay the bottles of heaven 3838 when the dust groweth into hardness and the clods cleave fast together 3839 wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion or fill the appetite of the young lions 3840 when they couch in their dens and abide in the covert to lie in wait 3841 who provideth for the raven his food when his young ones cry unto god they wander for lack of meat 391 knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve 392 canst thou number the months that they fulfil or knowest thou the time when they bring forth 393 they bow themselves they bring forth their young ones they cast out their sorrows 394 their young ones are in good liking they grow up with corn they go forth and return not unto them 395 who hath sent out the wild ass free or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass 396 whose house i have made the wilderness and the barren land his dwellings 397 he scorneth the multitude of the city neither regardeth he the crying of the driver 398 the range of the mountains is his pasture and he searcheth after every green thing 399 will the unicorn be willing to serve thee or abide by thy crib 3910 canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow or will he harrow the valleys after thee 3911 wilt thou trust him because his strength is great or wilt thou leave thy labour to him 3912 wilt thou believe him that he will bring home thy seed and gather it into thy barn 3913 gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks or wings and feathers unto the ostrich 3914 which leaveth her eggs in the earth and warmeth them in dust 3915 and forgetteth that the foot may crush them or that the wild beast may break them 3916 she is hardened against her young ones as though they were not hers her labour is in vain without fear 3917 because god hath deprived her of wisdom neither hath he imparted to her understanding 3918 what time she lifteth up herself on high she scorneth the horse and his rider 3919 hast thou given the horse strength hast thou clothed his neck with thunder 3920 canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper the glory of his nostrils is terrible 3921 he paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength he goeth on to meet the armed men 3922 he mocketh at fear and is not affrighted neither turneth he back from the sword 3923 the quiver rattleth against him the glittering spear and the shield 3924 he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet 3925 he saith among the trumpets ha ha and he smelleth the battle afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting 3926 doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom and stretch her wings toward the south 3927 doth the eagle mount up at thy command and make her nest on high 3928 she dwelleth and abideth on the rock upon the crag of the rock and the strong place 3929 from thence she seeketh the prey and her eyes behold afar off 3930 her young ones also suck up blood and where the slain are there is she 401 moreover the lord answered job and said 402 shall he that contendeth with the almighty instruct him he that reproveth god let him answer it 403 then job answered the lord and said 404 behold i am vile what shall i answer thee i will lay mine hand upon my mouth 405 once have i spoken but i will not answer yea twice but i will proceed no further 406 then answered the lord unto job out of the whirlwind and said 407 gird up thy loins now like a man i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me 408 wilt thou also disannul my judgment wilt thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous 409 hast thou an arm like god or canst thou thunder with a voice like him 4010 deck thyself now with majesty and excellency and array thyself with glory and beauty 4011 cast abroad the rage of thy wrath and behold every one that is proud and abase him 4012 look on every one that is proud and bring him low and tread down the wicked in their place 4013 hide them in the dust together and bind their faces in secret 4014 then will i also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee 4015 behold now behemoth which i made with thee he eateth grass as an ox 4016 lo now his strength is in his loins and his force is in the navel of his belly 4017 he moveth his tail like a cedar the sinews of his stones are wrapped together 4018 his bones are as strong pieces of brass his bones are like bars of iron 4019 he is the chief of the ways of god he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him 4020 surely the mountains bring him forth food where all the beasts of the field play 4021 he lieth under the shady trees in the covert of the reed and fens 4022 the shady trees cover him with their shadow the willows of the brook compass him about 4023 behold he drinketh up a river and hasteth not he trusteth that he can draw up jordan into his mouth 4024 he taketh it with his eyes his nose pierceth through snares 411 canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down 412 canst thou put an hook into his nose or bore his jaw through with a thorn 413 will he make many supplications unto thee will he speak soft words unto thee 414 will he make a covenant with thee wilt thou take him for a servant for ever 415 wilt thou play with him as with a bird or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens 416 shall the companions make a banquet of him shall they part him among the merchants 417 canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fish spears 418 lay thine hand upon him remember the battle do no more 419 behold the hope of him is in vain shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him 4110 none is so fierce that dare stir him up who then is able to stand before me 4111 who hath prevented me that i should repay him whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine 4112 i will not conceal his parts nor his power nor his comely proportion 4113 who can discover the face of his garment or who can come to him with his double bridle 4114 who can open the doors of his face his teeth are terrible round about 4115 his scales are his pride shut up together as with a close seal 4116 one is so near to another that no air can come between them 4117 they are joined one to another they stick together that they cannot be sundered 4118 by his neesings a light doth shine and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning 4119 out of his mouth go burning lamps and sparks of fire leap out 4120 out of his nostrils goeth smoke as out of a seething pot or caldron 4121 his breath kindleth coals and a flame goeth out of his mouth 4122 in his neck remaineth strength and sorrow is turned into joy before him 4123 the flakes of his flesh are joined together they are firm in themselves they cannot be moved 4124 his heart is as firm as a stone yea as hard as a piece of the nether millstone 4125 when he raiseth up himself the mighty are afraid by reason of breakings they purify themselves 4126 the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon 4127 he esteemeth iron as straw and brass as rotten wood 4128 the arrow cannot make him flee slingstones are turned with him into stubble 4129 darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear 4130 sharp stones are under him he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire 4131 he maketh the deep to boil like a pot he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment 4132 he maketh a path to shine after him one would think the deep to be hoary 4133 upon earth there is not his like who is made without fear 4134 he beholdeth all high things he is a king over all the children of pride 421 then job answered the lord and said 422 i know that thou canst do every thing and that no thought can be withholden from thee 423 who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge therefore have i uttered that i understood not things too wonderful for me which i knew not 424 hear i beseech thee and i will speak i will demand of thee and declare thou unto me 425 i have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear but now mine eye seeth thee 426 wherefore i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes 427 and it was so that after the lord had spoken these words unto job the lord said to eliphaz the temanite my wrath is kindled against thee and against thy two friends for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right as my servant job hath 428 therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams and go to my servant job and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering and my servant job shall pray for you for him will i accept lest i deal with you after your folly in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right like my servant job 429 so eliphaz the temanite and bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite went and did according as the lord commanded them the lord also accepted job 4210 and the lord turned the captivity of job when he prayed for his friends also the lord gave job twice as much as he had before 4211 then came there unto him all his brethren and all his sisters and all they that had been of his acquaintance before and did eat bread with him in his house and they bemoaned him and comforted him over all the evil that the lord had brought upon him every man also gave him a piece of money and every one an earring of gold 4212 so the lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning for he had fourteen thousand sheep and six thousand camels and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand she asses 4213 he had also seven sons and three daughters 4214 and he called the name of the first jemima and the name of the second kezia and the name of the third kerenhappuch 4215 and in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of job and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren 4216 after this lived job an hundred and forty years and saw his sons and his sons sons even four generations 4217 so job died being old and full of days the book of psalms 11 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful 12 but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night 13 and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper 14 the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away 15 therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous 16 for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish 21 why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing 22 the kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the lord and against his anointed saying 23 let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us 24 he that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh the lord shall have them in derision 25 then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure 26 yet have i set my king upon my holy hill of zion 27 i will declare the decree the lord hath said unto me thou art my son this day have i begotten thee 28 ask of me and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession 29 thou shalt break them with a rod of iron thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potters vessel 210 be wise now therefore o ye kings be instructed ye judges of the earth 211 serve the lord with fear and rejoice with trembling 212 kiss the son lest he be angry and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but a little blessed are all they that put their trust in him 31 lord how are they increased that trouble me many are they that rise up against me 32 many there be which say of my soul there is no help for him in god selah 33 but thou o lord art a shield for me my glory and the lifter up of mine head 34 i cried unto the lord with my voice and he heard me out of his holy hill selah 35 i laid me down and slept i awaked for the lord sustained me 36 i will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about 37 arise o lord save me o my god for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly 38 salvation belongeth unto the lord thy blessing is upon thy people selah 41 hear me when i call o god of my righteousness thou hast enlarged me when i was in distress have mercy upon me and hear my prayer 42 o ye sons of men how long will ye turn my glory into shame how long will ye love vanity and seek after leasing selah 43 but know that the lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself the lord will hear when i call unto him 44 stand in awe and sin not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still selah 45 offer the sacrifices of righteousness and put your trust in the lord 46 there be many that say who will shew us any good lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us 47 thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased 48 i will both lay me down in peace and sleep for thou lord only makest me dwell in safety 51 give ear to my words o lord consider my meditation 52 hearken unto the voice of my cry my king and my god for unto thee will i pray 53 my voice shalt thou hear in the morning o lord in the morning will i direct my prayer unto thee and will look up 54 for thou art not a god that hath pleasure in wickedness neither shall evil dwell with thee 55 the foolish shall not stand in thy sight thou hatest all workers of iniquity 56 thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing the lord will abhor the bloody and deceitful man 57 but as for me i will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy and in thy fear will i worship toward thy holy temple 58 lead me o lord in thy righteousness because of mine enemies make thy way straight before my face 59 for there is no faithfulness in their mouth their inward part is very wickedness their throat is an open sepulchre they flatter with their tongue 510 destroy thou them o god let them fall by their own counsels cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions for they have rebelled against thee 511 but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice let them ever shout for joy because thou defendest them let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee 512 for thou lord wilt bless the righteous with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield 61 o lord rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure 62 have mercy upon me o lord for i am weak o lord heal me for my bones are vexed 63 my soul is also sore vexed but thou o lord how long 64 return o lord deliver my soul oh save me for thy mercies sake 65 for in death there is no remembrance of thee in the grave who shall give thee thanks 66 i am weary with my groaning all the night make i my bed to swim i water my couch with my tears 67 mine eye is consumed because of grief it waxeth old because of all mine enemies 68 depart from me all ye workers of iniquity for the lord hath heard the voice of my weeping 69 the lord hath heard my supplication the lord will receive my prayer 610 let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed let them return and be ashamed suddenly 71 o lord my god in thee do i put my trust save me from all them that persecute me and deliver me 72 lest he tear my soul like a lion rending it in pieces while there is none to deliver 73 o lord my god if i have done this if there be iniquity in my hands 74 if i have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me yea i have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy 75 let the enemy persecute my soul and take it yea let him tread down my life upon the earth and lay mine honour in the dust selah 76 arise o lord in thine anger lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded 77 so shall the congregation of the people compass thee about for their sakes therefore return thou on high 78 the lord shall judge the people judge me o lord according to my righteousness and according to mine integrity that is in me 79 oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end but establish the just for the righteous god trieth the hearts and reins 710 my defence is of god which saveth the upright in heart 711 god judgeth the righteous and god is angry with the wicked every day 712 if he turn not he will whet his sword he hath bent his bow and made it ready 713 he hath also prepared for him the instruments of death he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors 714 behold he travaileth with iniquity and hath conceived mischief and brought forth falsehood 715 he made a pit and digged it and is fallen into the ditch which he made 716 his mischief shall return upon his own head and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate 717 i will praise the lord according to his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the lord most high 81 o lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth who hast set thy glory above the heavens 82 out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger 83 when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained 84 what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him 85 for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and honour 86 thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou hast put all things under his feet 87 all sheep and oxen yea and the beasts of the field 88 the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas 89 o lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth 91 i will praise thee o lord with my whole heart i will shew forth all thy marvellous works 92 i will be glad and rejoice in thee i will sing praise to thy name o thou most high 93 when mine enemies are turned back they shall fall and perish at thy presence 94 for thou hast maintained my right and my cause thou satest in the throne judging right 95 thou hast rebuked the heathen thou hast destroyed the wicked thou hast put out their name for ever and ever 96 o thou enemy destructions are come to a perpetual end and thou hast destroyed cities their memorial is perished with them 97 but the lord shall endure for ever he hath prepared his throne for judgment 98 and he shall judge the world in righteousness he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness 99 the lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble 910 and they that know thy name will put their trust in thee for thou lord hast not forsaken them that seek thee 911 sing praises to the lord which dwelleth in zion declare among the people his doings 912 when he maketh inquisition for blood he remembereth them he forgetteth not the cry of the humble 913 have mercy upon me o lord consider my trouble which i suffer of them that hate me thou that liftest me up from the gates of death 914 that i may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of zion i will rejoice in thy salvation 915 the heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made in the net which they hid is their own foot taken 916 the lord is known by the judgment which he executeth the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands higgaion selah 917 the wicked shall be turned into hell and all the nations that forget god 918 for the needy shall not alway be forgotten the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever 919 arise o lord let not man prevail let the heathen be judged in thy sight 920 put them in fear o lord that the nations may know themselves to be but men selah 101 why standest thou afar off o lord why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble 102 the wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined 103 for the wicked boasteth of his hearts desire and blesseth the covetous whom the lord abhorreth 104 the wicked through the pride of his countenance will not seek after god god is not in all his thoughts 105 his ways are always grievous thy judgments are far above out of his sight as for all his enemies he puffeth at them 106 he hath said in his heart i shall not be moved for i shall never be in adversity 107 his mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud under his tongue is mischief and vanity 108 he sitteth in the lurking places of the villages in the secret places doth he murder the innocent his eyes are privily set against the poor 109 he lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den he lieth in wait to catch the poor he doth catch the poor when he draweth him into his net 1010 he croucheth and humbleth himself that the poor may fall by his strong ones 1011 he hath said in his heart god hath forgotten he hideth his face he will never see it 1012 arise o lord o god lift up thine hand forget not the humble 1013 wherefore doth the wicked contemn god he hath said in his heart thou wilt not require it 1014 thou hast seen it for thou beholdest mischief and spite to requite it with thy hand the poor committeth himself unto thee thou art the helper of the fatherless 1015 break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man seek out his wickedness till thou find none 1016 the lord is king for ever and ever the heathen are perished out of his land 1017 lord thou hast heard the desire of the humble thou wilt prepare their heart thou wilt cause thine ear to hear 1018 to judge the fatherless and the oppressed that the man of the earth may no more oppress 111 in the lord put i my trust how say ye to my soul flee as a bird to your mountain 112 for lo the wicked bend their bow they make ready their arrow upon the string that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart 113 if the foundations be destroyed what can the righteous do 114 the lord is in his holy temple the lords throne is in heaven his eyes behold his eyelids try the children of men 115 the lord trieth the righteous but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth 116 upon the wicked he shall rain snares fire and brimstone and an horrible tempest this shall be the portion of their cup 117 for the righteous lord loveth righteousness his countenance doth behold the upright 121 help lord for the godly man ceaseth for the faithful fail from among the children of men 122 they speak vanity every one with his neighbour with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak 123 the lord shall cut off all flattering lips and the tongue that speaketh proud things 124 who have said with our tongue will we prevail our lips are our own who is lord over us 125 for the oppression of the poor for the sighing of the needy now will i arise saith the lord i will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him 126 the words of the lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of earth purified seven times 127 thou shalt keep them o lord thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever 128 the wicked walk on every side when the vilest men are exalted 131 how long wilt thou forget me o lord for ever how long wilt thou hide thy face from me 132 how long shall i take counsel in my soul having sorrow in my heart daily how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me 133 consider and hear me o lord my god lighten mine eyes lest i sleep the sleep of death 134 lest mine enemy say i have prevailed against him and those that trouble me rejoice when i am moved 135 but i have trusted in thy mercy my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation 136 i will sing unto the lord because he hath dealt bountifully with me 141 the fool hath said in his heart there is no god they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth good 142 the lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek god 143 they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one 144 have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread and call not upon the lord 145 there were they in great fear for god is in the generation of the righteous 146 ye have shamed the counsel of the poor because the lord is his refuge 147 oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion when the lord bringeth back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice and israel shall be glad 151 lord who shall abide in thy tabernacle who shall dwell in thy holy hill 152 he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness and speaketh the truth in his heart 153 he that backbiteth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his neighbour nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour 154 in whose eyes a vile person is contemned but he honoureth them that fear the lord he that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not 155 he that putteth not out his money to usury nor taketh reward against the innocent he that doeth these things shall never be moved 161 preserve me o god for in thee do i put my trust 162 o my soul thou hast said unto the lord thou art my lord my goodness extendeth not to thee 163 but to the saints that are in the earth and to the excellent in whom is all my delight 164 their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god their drink offerings of blood will i not offer nor take up their names into my lips 165 the lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup thou maintainest my lot 166 the lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places yea i have a goodly heritage 167 i will bless the lord who hath given me counsel my reins also instruct me in the night seasons 168 i have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand i shall not be moved 169 therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoiceth my flesh also shall rest in hope 1610 for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption 1611 thou wilt shew me the path of life in thy presence is fulness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore 171 hear the right o lord attend unto my cry give ear unto my prayer that goeth not out of feigned lips 172 let my sentence come forth from thy presence let thine eyes behold the things that are equal 173 thou hast proved mine heart thou hast visited me in the night thou hast tried me and shalt find nothing i am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress 174 concerning the works of men by the word of thy lips i have kept me from the paths of the destroyer 175 hold up my goings in thy paths that my footsteps slip not 176 i have called upon thee for thou wilt hear me o god incline thine ear unto me and hear my speech 177 shew thy marvellous lovingkindness o thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them 178 keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy wings 179 from the wicked that oppress me from my deadly enemies who compass me about 1710 they are inclosed in their own fat with their mouth they speak proudly 1711 they have now compassed us in our steps they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth 1712 like as a lion that is greedy of his prey and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places 1713 arise o lord disappoint him cast him down deliver my soul from the wicked which is thy sword 1714 from men which are thy hand o lord from men of the world which have their portion in this life and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure they are full of children and leave the rest of their substance to their babes 1715 as for me i will behold thy face in righteousness i shall be satisfied when i awake with thy likeness 181 i will love thee o lord my strength 182 the lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer my god my strength in whom i will trust my buckler and the horn of my salvation and my high tower 183 i will call upon the lord who is worthy to be praised so shall i be saved from mine enemies 184 the sorrows of death compassed me and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid 185 the sorrows of hell compassed me about the snares of death prevented me 186 in my distress i called upon the lord and cried unto my god he heard my voice out of his temple and my cry came before him even into his ears 187 then the earth shook and trembled the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken because he was wroth 188 there went up a smoke out of his nostrils and fire out of his mouth devoured coals were kindled by it 189 he bowed the heavens also and came down and darkness was under his feet 1810 and he rode upon a cherub and did fly yea he did fly upon the wings of the wind 1811 he made darkness his secret place his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies 1812 at the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed hail stones and coals of fire 1813 the lord also thundered in the heavens and the highest gave his voice hail stones and coals of fire 1814 yea he sent out his arrows and scattered them and he shot out lightnings and discomfited them 1815 then the channels of waters were seen and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke o lord at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils 1816 he sent from above he took me he drew me out of many waters 1817 he delivered me from my strong enemy and from them which hated me for they were too strong for me 1818 they prevented me in the day of my calamity but the lord was my stay 1819 he brought me forth also into a large place he delivered me because he delighted in me 1820 the lord rewarded me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me 1821 for i have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god 1822 for all his judgments were before me and i did not put away his statutes from me 1823 i was also upright before him and i kept myself from mine iniquity 1824 therefore hath the lord recompensed me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight 1825 with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright 1826 with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward 1827 for thou wilt save the afflicted people but wilt bring down high looks 1828 for thou wilt light my candle the lord my god will enlighten my darkness 1829 for by thee i have run through a troop and by my god have i leaped over a wall 1830 as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all those that trust in him 1831 for who is god save the lord or who is a rock save our god 1832 it is god that girdeth me with strength and maketh my way perfect 1833 he maketh my feet like hinds feet and setteth me upon my high places 1834 he teacheth my hands to war so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms 1835 thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand hath holden me up and thy gentleness hath made me great 1836 thou hast enlarged my steps under me that my feet did not slip 1837 i have pursued mine enemies and overtaken them neither did i turn again till they were consumed 1838 i have wounded them that they were not able to rise they are fallen under my feet 1839 for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me 1840 thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies that i might destroy them that hate me 1841 they cried but there was none to save them even unto the lord but he answered them not 1842 then did i beat them small as the dust before the wind i did cast them out as the dirt in the streets 1843 thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people and thou hast made me the head of the heathen a people whom i have not known shall serve me 1844 as soon as they hear of me they shall obey me the strangers shall submit themselves unto me 1845 the strangers shall fade away and be afraid out of their close places 1846 the lord liveth and blessed be my rock and let the god of my salvation be exalted 1847 it is god that avengeth me and subdueth the people under me 1848 he delivereth me from mine enemies yea thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me thou hast delivered me from the violent man 1849 therefore will i give thanks unto thee o lord among the heathen and sing praises unto thy name 1850 great deliverance giveth he to his king and sheweth mercy to his anointed to david and to his seed for evermore 191 the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament sheweth his handywork 192 day unto day uttereth speech and night unto night sheweth knowledge 193 there is no speech nor language where their voice is not heard 194 their line is gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun 195 which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race 196 his going forth is from the end of the heaven and his circuit unto the ends of it and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof 197 the law of the lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the lord is sure making wise the simple 198 the statutes of the lord are right rejoicing the heart the commandment of the lord is pure enlightening the eyes 199 the fear of the lord is clean enduring for ever the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether 1910 more to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb 1911 moreover by them is thy servant warned and in keeping of them there is great reward 1912 who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from secret faults 1913 keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins let them not have dominion over me then shall i be upright and i shall be innocent from the great transgression 1914 let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer 201 the lord hear thee in the day of trouble the name of the god of jacob defend thee 202 send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of zion 203 remember all thy offerings and accept thy burnt sacrifice selah 204 grant thee according to thine own heart and fulfil all thy counsel 205 we will rejoice in thy salvation and in the name of our god we will set up our banners the lord fulfil all thy petitions 206 now know i that the lord saveth his anointed he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand 207 some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the lord our god 208 they are brought down and fallen but we are risen and stand upright 209 save lord let the king hear us when we call 211 the king shall joy in thy strength o lord and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice 212 thou hast given him his hearts desire and hast not withholden the request of his lips selah 213 for thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head 214 he asked life of thee and thou gavest it him even length of days for ever and ever 215 his glory is great in thy salvation honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him 216 for thou hast made him most blessed for ever thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance 217 for the king trusteth in the lord and through the mercy of the most high he shall not be moved 218 thine hand shall find out all thine enemies thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee 219 thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger the lord shall swallow them up in his wrath and the fire shall devour them 2110 their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth and their seed from among the children of men 2111 for they intended evil against thee they imagined a mischievous device which they are not able to perform 2112 therefore shalt thou make them turn their back when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them 2113 be thou exalted lord in thine own strength so will we sing and praise thy power 221 my god my god why hast thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my roaring 222 o my god i cry in the day time but thou hearest not and in the night season and am not silent 223 but thou art holy o thou that inhabitest the praises of israel 224 our fathers trusted in thee they trusted and thou didst deliver them 225 they cried unto thee and were delivered they trusted in thee and were not confounded 226 but i am a worm and no man a reproach of men and despised of the people 227 all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip they shake the head saying 228 he trusted on the lord that he would deliver him let him deliver him seeing he delighted in him 229 but thou art he that took me out of the womb thou didst make me hope when i was upon my mothers breasts 2210 i was cast upon thee from the womb thou art my god from my mothers belly 2211 be not far from me for trouble is near for there is none to help 2212 many bulls have compassed me strong bulls of bashan have beset me round 2213 they gaped upon me with their mouths as a ravening and a roaring lion 2214 i am poured out like water and all my bones are out of joint my heart is like wax it is melted in the midst of my bowels 2215 my strength is dried up like a potsherd and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws and thou hast brought me into the dust of death 2216 for dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet 2217 i may tell all my bones they look and stare upon me 2218 they part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture 2219 but be not thou far from me o lord o my strength haste thee to help me 2220 deliver my soul from the sword my darling from the power of the dog 2221 save me from the lions mouth for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns 2222 i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation will i praise thee 2223 ye that fear the lord praise him all ye the seed of jacob glorify him and fear him all ye the seed of israel 2224 for he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted neither hath he hid his face from him but when he cried unto him he heard 2225 my praise shall be of thee in the great congregation i will pay my vows before them that fear him 2226 the meek shall eat and be satisfied they shall praise the lord that seek him your heart shall live for ever 2227 all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee 2228 for the kingdom is the lords and he is the governor among the nations 2229 all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him and none can keep alive his own soul 2230 a seed shall serve him it shall be accounted to the lord for a generation 2231 they shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born that he hath done this 231 the lord is my shepherd i shall not want 232 he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters 233 he restoreth my soul he

the floods 243 who shall ascend into the hill of the lord or who shall stand in his holy place 244 he that hath clean hands and a pure heart who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully 245 he shall receive the blessing from the lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation 246 this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face o jacob selah 247 lift

lovingkindnesses for they have been ever of old 257 remember not the sins of my youth nor my transgressions according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness sake o lord 258 good and upright is the lord therefore will he teach sinners in the way 259 the meek will he guide in judgment and the meek will he teach his way 2510 all the paths of the lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies 2511 for thy names sake o lord pardon mine iniquity for it is great 2512 what man is he that feareth the lord him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose 2513 his soul shall dwell at ease and his seed shall inherit the earth 2514 the secret of the lord is with them that fear him and he will shew them his covenant 2515 mine eyes are ever toward the lord for he

behold the beauty of the lord and to enquire in his temple 275 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock 276 and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy i will sing yea i will sing praises unto the lord 277 hear o lord when i cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me 278 when thou saidst seek ye my face my heart said unto thee thy face lord will i seek 279 hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in anger thou hast been my help leave me not neither forsake me o god of my salvation 2710 when my father and my mother forsake me then the lord will take me up 2711 teach me thy way o lord and lead me in a plain path because of mine enemies 2712 deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies for false witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty 2713 i had fainted unless i had believed to see the goodness of the lord in the land of the living 2714 wait on the lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart wait i say on the lord 281 unto thee will i cry o lord my rock be not silent to me lest if thou be silent to me i become like them that go down into the pit 282 hear the voice of my supplications when i cry unto thee when i lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle 283 draw me not away with the wicked and with the workers of iniquity which speak peace to their neighbours but mischief is in their hearts 284 give them according to their deeds and according to the wickedness of their endeavours give them after the work of their hands render to them their desert 285 because they regard not the works of the lord nor the operation of his hands he shall destroy them and not build them up 286 blessed be the lord because he hath heard the voice of my supplications 287 the lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and i am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth and with my song will i praise him 288 the lord is their strength and he is the saving strength of his anointed 289 save thy people and bless thine

divideth the flames of fire 298 the voice of the lord shaketh the wilderness the lord shaketh the wilderness of kadesh 299 the voice of the lord maketh the hinds to calve and discovereth the forests and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory 2910 the lord sitteth upon the flood yea the lord sitteth king for ever 2911 the lord will give strength unto his people the lord will bless his people with peace 301 i will extol thee o lord for thou hast lifted me up and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me 302 o lord my god i cried unto thee and thou hast healed me 303 o lord thou hast brought up my soul from the grave thou hast kept me alive that i should not go down to the pit 304 sing unto the lord o ye saints of his and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness 305 for his anger endureth but a moment in his favour is life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning 306 and in my prosperity i said i shall never be moved 307 lord by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong thou didst hide thy face and i was troubled 308 i cried to thee o lord and unto the lord i made supplication 309 what profit is there in my blood when i go down to the pit shall the dust praise thee shall it declare thy truth 3010 hear o lord and have mercy upon me lord be thou my helper 3011 thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing thou hast put off my sackcloth and girded me with gladness 3012 to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee and not be silent o lord my god i will give thanks unto thee for ever 311 in thee o lord do i put my trust

fortress therefore for thy names sake lead me and guide me 314 pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me for thou art my strength 315 into thine hand i commit my spirit thou hast redeemed me o lord god of truth 316 i have hated them that regard lying vanities but i trust in the lord 317 i will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy for thou hast considered my trouble thou hast known my soul in adversities 318 and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy thou hast set my feet in a large room 319 have mercy upon me o lord for i am in trouble mine eye is consumed with grief yea my soul and my belly 3110 for my life is spent with grief and my years with sighing my strength faileth because of mine iniquity and my bones are consumed 3111 i was a reproach among all mine enemies but especially among my neighbours and a fear to mine acquaintance they that did see me without fled from me 3112 i am forgotten as a dead man out of mind i am like a broken vessel 3113 for i have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while they took counsel together against me they devised to take away my life 3114 but i trusted in thee o lord i said thou art my god 3115 my times are in thy hand deliver me from the hand of mine enemies and from them that persecute me 3116 make thy face to shine upon thy servant save me for thy mercies sake 3117 let me not be ashamed o lord for i have called upon thee let the wicked be ashamed and let them be silent in the grave 3118 let the lying lips be put to silence which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous 3119 oh how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men 3120 thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues 3121 blessed be the lord for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city 3122 for i said in my haste i am cut off from before thine eyes nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when i cried unto thee 3123 o love the lord all ye his saints for the lord preserveth the faithful and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer 3124 be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart all ye that hope in the lord 321 blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered 322 blessed is the man unto whom the lord imputeth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no guile 323 when i kept silence my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long 324 for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me my moisture is turned into the drought of summer selah 325 i acknowledge my sin unto thee and mine iniquity have i not hid i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin selah 326 for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him 327 thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance selah 328 i will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go i will guide thee with mine eye 329 be ye not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle lest they come near unto thee 3210 many sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the lord mercy shall compass him about 3211 be glad in the lord and rejoice ye righteous and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart 331 rejoice in the lord o ye righteous for praise is comely for the upright 332 praise the lord with harp sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings 333 sing unto him a new song play skilfully with a loud noise 334 for the word of the lord is right and all his works are done in truth 335 he loveth righteousness and judgment the earth is full of the goodness of the lord 336 by the word of the lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth 337 he gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap he layeth up the depth in storehouses 338 let all the earth fear the lord let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him 339 for he spake and it was done he commanded and it stood fast 3310 the lord bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought he maketh the devices of the people of none effect 3311 the counsel of the lord standeth for ever the thoughts of his heart to all generations 3312 blessed is the nation whose god is the lord and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance 3313 the lord looketh from heaven he beholdeth all the sons of men 3314 from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth 3315 he fashioneth their hearts alike he considereth all their works 3316 there is no king saved by the multitude of an host a mighty man is not delivered by much strength 3317 an horse is a vain thing for safety neither shall he deliver any by his great strength 3318 behold the eye of the lord is upon them that fear him upon them that hope in his mercy 3319 to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine 3320 our soul waiteth for the lord he is our help and our shield 3321 for our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name 3322 let thy mercy o lord be upon us according as we hope in thee 341 i will bless the lord at all times his praise shall continually be in my mouth 342 my soul shall make her boast in the lord the humble shall hear thereof and be glad 343 o magnify the lord with me and let us exalt his name together 344 i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me from all my fears 345 they looked unto him and were lightened and their faces were not ashamed 346 this poor man cried and the lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles 347 the angel of the lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth them 348 o taste and see that the lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him 349 o fear the lord ye his saints for there is no want to them that fear him 3410 the young lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the lord shall not want any good thing 3411 come ye children hearken unto me i will teach you the fear of the lord 3412 what man is he that desireth life and loveth many days that he may see good 3413 keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile 3414 depart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it 3415 the eyes of the lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto their cry 3416 the face of the lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth 3417 the righteous cry and the lord heareth and delivereth them out of all their troubles 3418 the lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit 3419 many are the afflictions of the righteous but the lord delivereth him out of them all 3420 he keepeth all his bones not one of them is broken 3421 evil shall slay the wicked and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate 3422 the lord redeemeth the soul of his servants and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate 351 plead my cause o lord with them that strive with me fight against them that fight against me 352 take hold of shield and buckler and stand up for mine help 353 draw out also the spear and stop the way against them that persecute me say unto my soul i am thy salvation 354 let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt 355 let them be as chaff before the wind and let the angel of the lord chase them 356 let their way be dark and slippery and let the angel of the lord persecute them 357 for without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit which without cause they have digged for my soul 358 let destruction come upon him at unawares and let his net that he hath hid catch himself into that very destruction let him fall 359 and my soul shall be joyful in the lord it shall rejoice in his salvation 3510 all my bones shall say lord who is like unto thee which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him yea the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him 3511 false witnesses did rise up they laid to my charge things that i knew not 3512 they rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul 3513 but as for me when they were sick my clothing was sackcloth i humbled my soul with fasting and my prayer returned into mine own bosom 3514 i behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother i bowed down heavily as one that mourneth for his mother 3515 but in mine adversity they rejoiced and gathered themselves together yea the abjects gathered themselves together against me and i knew it not they did tear me and ceased not 3516 with hypocritical mockers in feasts they gnashed upon me with their teeth 3517 lord how long wilt thou look on rescue my soul from their destructions my darling from the lions 3518 i will give thee thanks in the great congregation i will praise thee among much people 3519 let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause 3520 for they speak not peace but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land 3521 yea they opened their mouth wide against me and said aha aha our eye hath seen it 3522 this thou hast seen o lord keep not silence o lord be not far from me 3523 stir up thyself and awake to my judgment even unto my cause my god and my lord 3524 judge me o lord my god according to thy righteousness and let them not rejoice over me 3525 let them not say in their hearts ah so would we have it let them not say we have swallowed him up 3526 let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt let them be clothed with shame and dishonour that magnify themselves against me 3527 let them shout for joy and be glad that favour my righteous cause yea let them say continually let the lord be magnified which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant 3528 and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long 361 the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart that there is no fear of god before his eyes 362 for he flattereth himself in his own eyes until his iniquity be found to be hateful 363 the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit he hath left off to be wise and to do good 364 he deviseth mischief upon his bed he setteth himself in a way that is not good he abhorreth not evil 365 thy mercy o lord is in the heavens and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds 366 thy righteousness is like the great mountains thy judgments are a great deep o lord thou preservest man and beast 367 how excellent is thy lovingkindness o god therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings 368 they shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures 369 for with thee is the fountain of life in thy light shall we see light 3610 o continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee and thy righteousness to the upright in heart 3611 let not the foot of pride come against me and let not the hand of the wicked remove me 3612 there are the workers of iniquity fallen they are cast down and shall not be able to rise 371 fret not thyself because of evildoers neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity 372 for they shall soon be cut down like the grass and wither as the green herb 373 trust in the lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed 374 delight thyself also in the lord and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart 375 commit thy way unto the lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass 376 and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light and thy judgment as the noonday 377 rest in the lord and wait patiently for him fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass 378 cease from anger and forsake wrath fret not thyself in any wise to do evil 379 for evildoers shall be cut off but those that wait upon the lord they shall inherit the earth 3710 for yet a little while and the wicked shall not be yea thou shalt diligently consider his place and it shall not be 3711 but the meek shall inherit the earth and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace 3712 the wicked plotteth against the just and gnasheth upon him with his teeth 3713 the lord shall laugh at him for he seeth that his day is coming 3714 the wicked have drawn out the sword and have bent their bow to cast down the poor and needy and to slay such as be of upright conversation 3715 their sword shall enter into their own heart and their bows shall be broken 3716 a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked 3717 for the arms of the wicked shall be broken but the lord upholdeth the righteous 3718 the lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall be for ever 3719 they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied 3720 but the wicked shall perish and the enemies of the lord shall be as the fat of lambs they shall consume into smoke shall they consume away 3721 the wicked borroweth and payeth not again but the righteous sheweth mercy and giveth 3722 for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off 3723 the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way 3724 though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand 3725 i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread 3726 he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed 3727 depart from evil and do good and dwell for evermore 3728 for the lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his saints they are preserved for ever but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off 3729 the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell therein for ever 3730 the mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom and his tongue talketh of judgment 3731 the law of his god is in his heart none of his steps shall slide 3732 the wicked watcheth the righteous and seeketh to slay him 3733 the lord will not leave him in his hand nor condemn him when he is judged 3734 wait on the lord and keep his way and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off thou shalt see it 3735 i have seen the wicked in great power and spreading himself like a green bay tree 3736 yet he passed away and lo he was not yea i sought him but he could not be found 3737 mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace 3738 but the transgressors shall be destroyed together the end of the wicked shall be cut off 3739 but the salvation of the righteous is of the lord he is their strength in the time of trouble 3740 and the lord shall help them and deliver them he shall deliver them from the wicked and save them because they trust in him 381 o lord rebuke me not in thy wrath neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure 382 for thine arrows stick fast in me and thy hand presseth me sore 383 there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin 384 for mine iniquities are gone over mine head as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me 385 my wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness 386 i am troubled i am bowed down greatly i go mourning all the day long 387 for my loins are filled with a loathsome disease and there is no soundness in my flesh 388 i am feeble and sore broken i have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart 389 lord all my desire is before thee and my groaning is not hid from thee 3810 my heart panteth my strength faileth me as for the light of mine eyes it also is gone from me 3811 my lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore and my kinsmen stand afar off 3812 they also that seek after my life lay snares for me and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things and imagine deceits all the day long 3813 but i as a deaf man heard not and i was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth 3814 thus i was as a man that heareth not and in whose mouth are no reproofs 3815 for in thee o lord do i hope thou wilt hear o lord my god 3816 for i said hear me lest otherwise they should rejoice over me when my foot slippeth they magnify themselves against me 3817 for i am ready to halt and my sorrow is continually before me 3818 for i will declare mine iniquity i will be sorry for my sin 3819 but mine enemies are lively and they are strong and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied 3820 they also that render evil for good are mine adversaries because i follow the thing that good is 3821 forsake me not o lord o my god be not far from me 3822 make haste to help me o lord my salvation 391 i said i will take heed to my ways that i sin not with my tongue i will keep my mouth with a bridle while the wicked is before me 392 i was dumb with silence i held my peace even from good and my sorrow was stirred 393 my heart was hot within me while i was musing the fire burned then spake i with my tongue 394 lord make me to know mine end and the measure of my days what it is that i may know how frail i am 395 behold thou hast made my days as an handbreadth and mine age is as nothing before thee verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity selah 396 surely every man walketh in a vain shew surely they are disquieted in vain he heapeth up riches and knoweth not who shall gather them 397 and now lord what wait i for my hope is in thee 398 deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach of the foolish 399 i was dumb i opened not my mouth because thou didst it 3910 remove thy stroke away from me i am consumed by the blow of thine hand 3911 when thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth surely every man is vanity selah 3912 hear my prayer o lord and give ear unto my cry hold not thy peace at my tears for i am a stranger with thee and a sojourner as all my fathers were 3913 o spare me that i may recover strength before i go hence and be no more 401 i waited patiently for the lord and he inclined unto me and heard my cry 402 he brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings 403 and he hath put a new song in my mouth even praise unto our god many shall see it and fear and shall trust in the lord 404 blessed is that man that maketh the lord his trust and respecteth not the proud nor such as turn aside to lies 405 many o lord my god are thy wonderful works which thou hast done and thy thoughts which are to usward they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee if i would declare and speak of them they are more than can be numbered 406 sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire mine ears hast thou opened burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required 407 then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me 408 i delight to do thy will o my god yea thy law is within my heart 409 i have preached righteousness in the great congregation lo i have not refrained my lips o lord thou knowest 4010 i have not hid thy righteousness within my heart i have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation i have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation 4011 withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me o lord let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me 4012 for innumerable evils have compassed me about mine iniquities have taken hold upon me so that i am not able to look up they are more than the hairs of mine head therefore my heart faileth me 4013 be pleased o lord to deliver me o lord make haste to help me 4014 let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil 4015 let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me aha aha 4016 let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let such as love thy salvation say continually the lord be magnified 4017 but i am poor and needy yet the lord thinketh upon me thou art my help and my deliverer make no tarrying o my god 411 blessed is he that considereth the poor the lord will deliver him in time of trouble 412 the lord will preserve him and keep him alive and he shall be blessed upon the earth and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies 413 the lord will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness 414 i said lord be merciful unto me heal my soul for i have sinned against thee 415 mine enemies speak evil of me when shall he die and his name perish 416 and if he come to see me he speaketh vanity his heart gathereth iniquity to itself when he goeth abroad he telleth it 417 all that hate me whisper together against me against me do they devise my hurt 418 an evil disease say they cleaveth fast unto him and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more 419 yea mine own familiar friend in whom i trusted which did eat of my bread hath lifted up his heel against me 4110 but thou o lord be merciful unto me and raise me up that i may requite them 4111 by this i know that thou favourest me because mine enemy doth not triumph over me 4112 and as for me thou upholdest me in mine integrity and settest me before thy face for ever 4113 blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting and to everlasting amen and amen 421 as the hart panteth after the water brooks so panteth my soul after thee o god 422 my soul thirsteth for god for the living god when shall i come and appear before god 423 my tears have been my meat day and night while they continually say unto me where is thy god 424 when i remember these things i pour out my soul in me for i had gone with the multitude i went with them to the house of god with the voice of joy and praise with a multitude that kept holyday 425 why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted in me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance 426 o my god my soul is cast down within me therefore will i remember thee from the land of jordan and of the hermonites from the hill mizar 427 deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me 428 yet the lord will command his lovingkindness in the day time and in the night his song shall be with me and my prayer unto the god of my life 429 i will say unto god my rock why hast thou forgotten me why go i mourning because of the oppression of the enemy 4210 as with a sword in my bones mine enemies reproach me while they say daily unto me where is thy god 4211 why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope thou in god for i shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my god 431 judge me o god and plead my cause against an ungodly nation o deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man 432 for thou art the god of my strength why dost thou cast me

the altar of god unto god my exceeding joy yea upon the harp will i praise thee o god my god 435 why art thou cast down o my soul and why art thou disquieted within me hope in god for i shall yet praise him who is the health of my countenance and my god 441 we have heard with our ears o god our fathers have told us what work thou didst in their days in the times of old 442 how thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand and plantedst them how thou didst afflict the people and cast them out 443 for they got not the land in possession by their own sword neither did their own arm save them but thy right hand and thine arm and the light of thy countenance because thou hadst a favour unto them 444 thou art my king o god command deliverances for jacob 445 through thee will we push down our enemies through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us 446 for i will not trust in my bow neither shall my sword save me 447 but thou hast saved us from our enemies and hast put them to shame that hated us 448 in god we boast all the day long and praise thy name for ever selah 449 but thou hast cast off and put us to shame and goest not forth with our armies 4410 thou makest us to turn back from the enemy and they which hate us spoil for themselves 4411 thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat and hast scattered us among the heathen 4412 thou sellest thy people for nought and dost not increase thy wealth by their price 4413 thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us 4414 thou makest us a byword among the heathen a shaking of the head among the people 4415 my confusion is continually before me and the shame of my face hath covered me 4416 for the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth by reason of the enemy and avenger 4417 all this is come upon us yet have we not forgotten thee neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant 4418 our heart is not turned back neither have our steps declined from thy way 4419 though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons and covered us with the shadow of death 4420 if we have forgotten the name of our god or stretched out our hands to a strange god 4421 shall not god search this out for he knoweth the secrets of the heart 4422 yea for thy sake are we killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter 4423 awake why sleepest thou o lord arise cast us not off for ever 4424 wherefore hidest thou thy face and forgettest our affliction and our oppression 4425 for our soul is bowed down to the dust our belly cleaveth unto the earth 4426 arise for our help and redeem us for thy mercies sake 451 my heart is inditing a good matter i speak of the things which i have made touching the king my tongue is the pen of a ready writer 452 thou art fairer than the children of men grace is poured into thy lips therefore god hath blessed thee for ever 453 gird thy sword upon thy thigh o most mighty with thy glory and thy majesty 454 and in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things 455 thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the kings enemies whereby the people fall under thee 456 thy throne o god is for ever and ever the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre 457 thou lovest righteousness and hatest wickedness therefore god thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows 458 all thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of the ivory palaces whereby they have made thee glad 459 kings daughters were among thy honourable women upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of ophir 4510 hearken o daughter and consider and incline thine ear forget also thine own people and thy fathers house 4511 so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty for he is thy lord and worship thou him 4512 and the daughter of tyre shall be there with a gift even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour 4513 the kings daughter is all glorious within her clothing is of wrought gold 4514 she shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee 4515 with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought they shall enter into the kings palace 4516 instead of thy fathers shall be thy children whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth 4517 i will make thy name to be remembered in all generations therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever 461 god is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble 462 therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea 463 though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof selah 464 there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of god the holy place of the tabernacles of the most high 465 god is in the midst of her she shall not be moved god shall help her and that right early 466 the heathen raged the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice the earth melted 467 the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge selah 468 come behold the works of the lord what desolations he hath made in the earth 469 he maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth he breaketh the bow and cutteth the spear in sunder he burneth the chariot in the fire 4610 be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth 4611 the lord of hosts is with us the god of jacob is our refuge selah 471 o clap your hands all ye people shout unto god with the voice of triumph 472 for the lord most high is terrible he is a great king over all the earth 473 he shall subdue the people under us and the nations under our feet 474 he shall choose our inheritance for us the excellency of jacob whom he loved selah 475 god is gone up with a shout the lord with the sound of a trumpet 476 sing praises to god sing praises sing praises unto our king sing praises 477 for god is the king of all the earth sing ye praises with understanding 478 god reigneth over the heathen god sitteth upon the throne of his holiness 479 the princes of the people are gathered together even the people of the god of abraham for the shields of the earth belong unto god he is greatly exalted 481 great is the lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our god in the mountain of his holiness 482 beautiful for situation the joy of the whole earth is mount zion on the sides of the north the city of the great king 483 god is known in her palaces for a refuge 484 for lo the kings were assembled they passed by together 485 they saw it and so they marvelled they were troubled and hasted away 486 fear took hold upon them there and pain as of a woman in travail 487 thou breakest the ships of tarshish with an east wind 488 as we have heard so have we seen in the city of the lord of hosts in the city of our god god will establish it for ever selah 489 we have thought of thy lovingkindness o god in the midst of thy temple 4810 according to thy name o god so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth thy right hand is full of righteousness 4811 let mount zion rejoice let the daughters of judah be glad because of thy judgments 4812 walk about zion and go round about her tell the towers thereof 4813 mark ye well her bulwarks consider her palaces that ye may tell it to the generation following 4814 for this god is our god for ever and ever he will be our guide even unto death 491 hear this all ye people give ear all ye inhabitants of the world 492 both low and high rich and poor together 493 my mouth shall speak of wisdom and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding 494 i will incline mine ear to a parable i will open my dark saying upon the harp 495 wherefore should i fear in the days of evil when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about 496 they that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches 497 none of them can by any means redeem his brother nor give to god a ransom for him 498 for the redemption of their soul is precious and it ceaseth for ever 499 that he should still live for ever and not see corruption 4910 for he seeth that wise men die likewise the fool and the brutish person perish and leave their wealth to others 4911 their inward thought is that their houses shall continue for ever and their dwelling places to all generations they call their lands after their own names 4912 nevertheless man being in honour abideth not he is like the beasts that perish 4913 this their way is their folly yet their posterity approve their sayings selah 4914 like sheep they are laid in the grave death shall feed on them and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling 4915 but god will redeem my soul from the power of the grave for he shall receive me selah 4916 be not thou afraid when one is made rich when the glory of his house is increased 4917 for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away his glory shall not descend after him 4918 though while he lived he blessed his soul and men will praise thee when thou doest well to thyself 4919 he shall go to the generation of his fathers they shall never see light 4920 man that is in honour and understandeth not is like the beasts that perish 501 the mighty god even the lord hath spoken and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof 502 out of zion the perfection of beauty god hath shined 503 our god shall come and shall not keep silence a fire shall devour before him and it shall be very tempestuous round about him 504 he shall call to the heavens from above and to the earth that he may judge his people 505 gather my saints together unto me those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice 506 and the heavens shall declare his righteousness for god is judge himself selah 507 hear o my people and i will speak o israel and i will testify against thee i am god even thy god 508 i will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings to have been continually before me 509 i will take no bullock out of thy house nor he goats out of thy folds 5010 for every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle upon a thousand hills 5011 i know all the fowls of the mountains and the wild beasts of the field are mine 5012 if i were hungry i would not tell thee for the world is mine and the fulness thereof 5013 will i eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats 5014 offer unto god thanksgiving and pay thy vows unto the most high 5015 and call upon me in the day of trouble i will deliver thee and thou shalt glorify me 5016 but unto the wicked god saith what hast thou to do to declare my statutes or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth 5017 seeing thou hatest instruction and casteth my words behind thee 5018 when thou sawest a thief then thou consentedst with him and hast been partaker with adulterers 5019 thou givest thy mouth to evil and thy tongue frameth deceit 5020 thou sittest and speakest against thy brother thou slanderest thine own mothers son 5021 these things hast thou done and i kept silence thou thoughtest that i was altogether such an one as thyself but i will reprove thee and set them in order before thine eyes 5022 now consider this ye that forget god lest i tear you in pieces and there be none to deliver 5023 whoso offereth praise glorifieth me and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will i shew the salvation of god 511 have mercy upon me o god according to thy lovingkindness according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions 512 wash me throughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me from my sin 513 for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever before me 514 against thee thee only have i sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest and be clear when thou judgest 515 behold i was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me 516 behold thou desirest truth in the inward parts and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom 517 purge me with hyssop and i shall be clean wash me and i shall be whiter than snow 518 make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice 519 hide thy face from my sins and blot out all mine iniquities 5110 create in me a clean heart o god and renew a right spirit within me 5111 cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me 5112 restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit 5113 then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted unto thee 5114 deliver me from bloodguiltiness o god thou god of my salvation and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness 5115 o lord open thou my lips and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise 5116 for thou desirest not sacrifice else would i give it thou delightest not in burnt offering 5117 the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise 5118 do good in thy good pleasure unto zion build thou the walls of jerusalem 5119 then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness with burnt offering and whole burnt offering then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar 521 why boastest thou thyself in mischief o mighty man the goodness of god endureth continually 522 the tongue deviseth mischiefs like a sharp razor working deceitfully 523 thou lovest evil more than good and lying rather than to speak righteousness selah 524 thou lovest all devouring words o thou deceitful tongue 525 god shall likewise destroy thee for ever he shall take thee away and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place and root thee out of the land of the living selah 526 the righteous also shall see and fear and shall laugh at him 527 lo this is the man that made not god his strength but trusted in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his wickedness 528 but i am like a green olive tree in the house of god i trust in the mercy of god for ever and ever 529 i will praise thee for ever because thou hast done it and i will wait on thy name for it is good before thy saints 531 the fool hath said in his heart there is no god corrupt are they and have done abominable iniquity there is none that doeth good 532 god looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand that did seek god 533 every one of them is gone back they are altogether become filthy there is none that doeth good no not one 534 have the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread they have not called upon god 535 there were they in great fear where no fear was for god hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee thou hast put them to shame because god hath despised them 536 oh that the salvation of israel were come out of zion when god bringeth back the captivity of his people jacob shall rejoice and israel shall be glad 541 save me o god by thy name and judge me by thy strength 542 hear my prayer o god give ear to the words of my mouth 543 for strangers are risen up against me and oppressors seek after my soul they have not set god before them selah 544 behold god is mine helper the lord is with them that uphold my soul 545 he shall reward evil unto mine enemies cut them off in thy truth 546 i will freely sacrifice unto thee i will praise thy name o lord for it is good 547 for he hath delivered me out of all trouble and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies 551 give ear to my prayer o god and hide not thyself from my supplication 552 attend unto me and hear me i mourn in my complaint and make a noise 553 because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked for they cast iniquity upon me and in wrath they hate me 554 my heart is sore pained within me and the terrors of death are fallen upon me 555 fearfulness and trembling are come upon me and horror hath overwhelmed me 556 and i said oh that i had wings like a dove for then would i fly away and be at rest 557 lo then would i wander far off and remain in the wilderness selah 558 i would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest 559 destroy o lord and divide their tongues for i have seen violence and strife in the city 5510 day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it 5511 wickedness is in the midst thereof deceit and guile depart not from her streets 5512 for it was not an enemy that reproached me then i could have borne it neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me then i would have hid myself from him 5513 but it was thou a man mine equal my guide and mine acquaintance 5514 we took sweet counsel together and walked unto the house of god in company 5515 let death seize upon them and let them go down quick into hell for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them 5516 as for me i will call upon god and the lord shall save me 5517 evening and morning and at noon will i pray and cry aloud and he shall hear my voice 5518 he hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me for there were many with me 5519 god shall hear and afflict them even he that abideth of old selah because they have no changes therefore they fear not god 5520 he hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him he hath broken his covenant 5521 the words of his mouth were smoother than butter but war was in his heart his words were softer than oil yet were they drawn swords 5522 cast thy burden upon the lord and he shall sustain thee he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved 5523 but thou o god shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days but i will trust in thee 561 be merciful unto me o god for man would swallow me up he fighting daily oppresseth me 562 mine enemies would daily swallow me up for they be many that fight against me o thou most high 563 what time i am afraid i will trust in thee 564 in god i will praise his word in god i have put my trust i will not fear what flesh can do unto me 565 every day they wrest my words all their thoughts are against me for evil 566 they gather themselves together they hide themselves they mark my steps when they wait for my soul 567 shall they escape by iniquity in thine anger cast down the people o god 568 thou tellest my wanderings put thou my tears into thy bottle are they not in thy book 569 when i cry unto thee then shall mine enemies turn back this i know for god is for me 5610 in god will i praise his word in the lord will i praise his word 5611 in god have i put my trust i will not be afraid what man can do unto me 5612 thy vows are upon me o god i will render praises unto thee 5613 for thou hast delivered my soul from death wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling that i may walk before god in the light of the living 571 be merciful unto me o god be merciful unto me for my soul trusteth in thee yea in the shadow of thy wings will i make my refuge until these calamities be overpast 572 i will cry unto god most high unto god that performeth all things for me 573 he shall send from heaven and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up selah god shall send forth his mercy and his truth 574 my soul is among lions and i lie even among them that are set on fire even the sons of men whose teeth are spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword 575 be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earth 576 they have prepared a net for my steps my soul is bowed down they have digged a pit before me into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves selah 577 my heart is fixed o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise 578 awake up my glory awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake early 579 i will praise thee o lord among the people i will sing unto thee among the nations 5710 for thy mercy is great unto the heavens and thy truth unto the clouds 5711 be thou exalted o god above the heavens let thy glory be above all the earth 581 do ye indeed speak righteousness o congregation do ye judge uprightly o ye sons of men 582 yea in heart ye work wickedness ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth 583 the wicked are estranged from the womb they go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies 584 their poison is like the poison of a serpent they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear 585 which will not hearken to the voice of charmers charming never so wisely 586 break their teeth o god in their mouth break out the great teeth of the young lions o lord 587 let them melt away as waters which run continually when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows let them be as cut in pieces 588 as a snail which melteth let every one of them pass away like the untimely birth of a woman that they may not see the sun 589 before your pots can feel the thorns he shall take them away as with a whirlwind both living and in his wrath 5810 the righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked 5811 so that a man shall say verily there is a reward for the righteous verily he is a god that judgeth in the earth 591 deliver me from mine enemies o my god defend me from them that rise up against me 592 deliver me from the workers of iniquity and save me from bloody men 593 for lo they lie in wait for my soul the mighty are gathered against me not for my transgression nor for my sin o lord 594 they run and prepare themselves without my fault awake to help me and behold 595 thou therefore o lord god of hosts the god of israel awake to visit all the heathen be not merciful to any wicked transgressors selah 596 they return at evening they make a noise like a dog and go round about the city 597 behold they belch out with their mouth swords are in their lips for who say they doth hear 598 but thou o lord shalt laugh at them thou shalt have all the heathen in derision 599 because of his strength will i wait upon thee for god is my defence 5910 the god of my mercy shall prevent me god shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies 5911 slay them not lest my people forget scatter them by thy power and bring them down o lord our shield 5912 for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride and for cursing and lying which they speak 5913 consume them in wrath consume them that they may not be and let them know that god ruleth in jacob unto the ends of the earth selah 5914 and at evening let them return and let them make a noise like a dog and go round about the city 5915 let them wander up and down for meat and grudge if they be not satisfied 5916 but i will sing of thy power yea i will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble 5917 unto thee o my strength will i sing for god is my defence and the god of my mercy 601 o god thou hast cast us off thou hast scattered us thou hast been displeased o turn thyself to us again 602 thou hast made the earth to tremble thou hast broken it heal the breaches thereof for it shaketh 603 thou hast shewed thy people hard things thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment 604 thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee that it may be displayed because of the truth selah 605 that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and hear me 606 god hath spoken in his holiness i will rejoice i will divide shechem and mete out the valley of succoth 607 gilead is mine and manasseh is mine ephraim also is the strength of mine head judah is my lawgiver 608 moab is my washpot over edom will i cast out my shoe philistia triumph thou because of me 609 who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into edom 6010 wilt not thou o god which hadst cast us off and thou o god which didst not go out with our armies 6011 give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man 6012 through god we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread down our enemies 611 hear my cry o god attend unto my prayer 612 from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i 613 for thou hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy 614 i will abide in thy tabernacle for ever i will trust in the covert of thy wings selah 615 for thou o god hast heard my vows thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name 616 thou wilt prolong the kings life and his years as many generations 617 he shall abide before god for ever o prepare mercy and truth which may preserve him 618 so will i sing praise unto thy name for ever that i may daily perform my vows 621 truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation 622 he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence i shall not be greatly moved 623 how long will ye imagine mischief against a man ye shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall ye be and as a tottering fence 624 they only consult to cast him down from his excellency they delight in lies they bless with their mouth but they curse inwardly selah 625 my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him 626 he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence i shall not be moved 627 in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god 628 trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us selah 629 surely men of low degree are vanity and men of high degree are a lie to be laid in the balance they are altogether lighter than vanity 6210 trust not in oppression and become not vain in robbery if riches increase set not your heart upon them 6211 god hath spoken once twice have i heard this that power belongeth unto god 6212 also unto thee o lord belongeth mercy for thou renderest to every man according to his work 631 o god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is 632 to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary 633 because thy lovingkindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee 634 thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name 635 my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips 636 when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches 637 because thou hast been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice 638 my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me 639 but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth 6310 they shall fall by the sword they shall be a portion for foxes 6311 but the king shall rejoice in god every one that sweareth by him shall glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped 641 hear my voice o god in my prayer preserve my life from fear of the enemy 642 hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity 643 who whet their tongue like a sword and bend their bows to shoot their arrows even bitter words 644 that they may shoot in secret at the perfect suddenly do they shoot at him and fear not 645 they encourage themselves in an evil matter they commune of laying snares privily they say who shall see them 646 they search out iniquities they accomplish a diligent search both the inward thought of every one of them and the heart is deep 647 but god shall shoot at them with an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded 648 so they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves all that see them shall flee away 649 and all men shall fear and shall declare the work of god for they shall wisely consider of his doing 6410 the righteous shall be glad in the lord and shall trust in him and all the upright in heart shall glory 651 praise waiteth for thee o god in sion and unto thee shall the vow be performed 652 o thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall all flesh come 653 iniquities prevail against me as for our transgressions thou shalt purge them away 654 blessed is the man whom thou choosest and causest to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple 655 by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us o god of our salvation who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth and of them that are afar off upon the sea 656 which by his strength setteth fast the mountains being girded with power 657 which stilleth the noise of the seas the noise of their waves and the tumult of the people 658 they also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice 659 thou visitest the earth and waterest it thou greatly enrichest it with the river of god which is full of water thou preparest them corn when thou hast so provided for it 6510 thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly thou settlest the furrows thereof thou makest it soft with showers thou blessest the springing thereof 6511 thou crownest the year with thy goodness and thy paths drop fatness 6512 they drop upon the pastures of the wilderness and the little hills rejoice on every side 6513 the pastures are clothed with flocks the valleys also are covered over with corn they shout for joy they also sing 661 make a joyful noise unto god all ye lands 662 sing forth the honour of his name make his praise glorious 663 say unto god how terrible art thou in thy works through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee 664 all the earth shall worship thee and shall sing unto thee they shall sing to thy name selah 665 come and see the works of god he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men 666

selah 668 o bless our god ye people and make the voice of his praise to be heard 669 which holdeth our soul in life and suffereth not our feet to be moved 6610 for thou o god hast proved us thou hast tried us as silver is tried 6611 thou broughtest us into the net thou laidst affliction upon our loins 6612 thou hast caused men to ride over our heads we went through fire and through water but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place 6613 i will go into thy house with burnt offerings i will pay thee my vows 6614 which my lips have uttered and my mouth hath spoken when i was in trouble 6615 i will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings with the incense of rams i will offer bullocks with goats selah 6616 come and hear all ye that fear god and i will declare what he hath done for my soul 6617 i cried unto him with my mouth and he was extolled with my tongue 6618 if i regard iniquity in my heart the lord will not hear me 6619 but verily god hath heard me he hath attended to the voice of my prayer 6620 blessed be god which hath not turned away my prayer nor his mercy from me 671 god be merciful unto us and bless us and cause his face to shine upon us selah 672 that thy way may be known upon earth thy saving health among all nations 673 let the people praise thee o god let all the people praise thee 674 o let the nations be glad and sing for joy for thou shalt judge the people righteously and govern the nations upon earth selah 675 let the people praise thee o god let all the people praise thee 676 then shall the earth yield her increase and god even our own god shall bless us 677 god shall bless us and all the ends of the earth shall fear him 681 let god arise let his enemies be scattered let them also that hate him flee before him 682 as smoke is driven away so drive them away as wax melteth before the fire so let the wicked perish at the presence of god 683 but let the righteous be glad let them rejoice before god yea let them exceedingly rejoice 684 sing unto god sing praises to his name extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name jah and rejoice before him 685 a father of the fatherless and a judge of the widows is god in his holy habitation 686 god setteth the solitary in families he bringeth out those which are bound with chains but the rebellious dwell in a dry land 687 o god when thou wentest forth before thy people when thou didst march through the wilderness selah 688 the earth shook the heavens also dropped at the presence of god even sinai itself was moved at the presence of god the god of israel 689 thou o god didst send a plentiful rain whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance when it was weary 6810 thy congregation hath dwelt therein thou o god hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor 6811 the lord gave the word great was the company of those that published it 6812 kings of armies did flee apace and she that tarried at home divided the spoil 6813 though ye have lien among the pots yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver and her feathers with yellow gold 6814 when the almighty scattered kings in it it was white as snow in salmon 6815 the hill of god is as the hill of bashan an high hill as the hill of bashan 6816 why leap ye ye high hills this is the hill which god desireth to dwell in yea the lord will dwell in it for ever 6817 the chariots of god are twenty thousand even thousands of angels the lord is among them as in sinai in the holy place 6818 thou hast ascended on high thou hast led captivity captive thou hast received gifts for men yea for the rebellious also that the lord god might dwell among them 6819 blessed be the lord who daily loadeth us with benefits even the god of our salvation selah 6820 he that is our god is the god of salvation and unto god the lord belong the issues from death 6821 but god shall wound the head of his enemies and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses 6822 the lord said i will bring again from bashan i will bring my people again from the depths of the sea 6823 that thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies and the tongue of thy dogs in the same 6824 they have seen thy goings o god even the goings of my god my king in the sanctuary 6825 the singers went before the players on instruments followed after among them were the damsels playing with timbrels 6826 bless ye god in the congregations even the lord from the fountain of israel 6827 there is little benjamin with their ruler the princes of judah and their council the princes of zebulun and the princes of naphtali 6828 thy god hath commanded thy strength strengthen o god that which thou hast wrought for us 6829 because of thy temple at jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee 6830 rebuke the company of spearmen the multitude of the bulls with the calves of the people till every one submit himself with pieces of silver scatter thou the people that delight in war 6831 princes shall come out of egypt ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto god 6832 sing unto god ye kingdoms of the earth o sing praises unto the lord selah 6833 to him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens which were of old lo he doth send out his voice and that a mighty voice 6834 ascribe ye strength unto god his excellency is over israel and his strength is in the clouds 6835 o god thou art terrible out of thy holy places the god of israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people blessed be god 691 save me o god for the waters are come in unto my soul 692 i sink in deep mire where there is no standing i am come into deep waters where the floods overflow me 693 i am weary of my crying my throat is dried mine eyes fail while i wait for my god 694 they that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head they that would destroy me being mine enemies wrongfully are mighty then i restored that which i took not away 695 o god thou knowest my foolishness and my sins are not hid from thee 696 let not them that wait on thee o lord god of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o god of israel 697 because for thy sake i have borne reproach shame hath covered my face 698 i am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mothers children 699 for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me 6910 when i wept and chastened my soul with fasting that was to my reproach 6911 i made sackcloth also my garment and i became a proverb to them 6912 they that sit in the gate speak against me and i was the song of the drunkards 6913 but as for me my prayer is unto thee o lord in an acceptable time o god in the multitude of thy mercy hear me in the truth of thy salvation 6914 deliver me out of the mire and let me not sink let me be delivered from them that hate me and out of the deep waters 6915 let not the waterflood overflow me neither let the deep swallow me up and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me 6916 hear me o lord for thy lovingkindness is good turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies 6917 and hide not thy face from thy servant for i am in trouble hear me speedily 6918 draw nigh unto my soul and redeem it deliver me because of mine enemies 6919 thou hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonour mine adversaries are all before thee 6920 reproach hath broken my heart and i am full of heaviness and i looked for some to take pity but there was none and for comforters but i found none 6921 they gave me also gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink 6922 let their table become a snare before them and that which should have been for their welfare let it become a trap 6923 let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their loins continually to shake 6924 pour out thine indignation upon them and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them 6925 let their habitation be desolate and let none dwell in their tents 6926 for they persecute him whom thou hast smitten and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded 6927 add iniquity unto their iniquity and let them not come into thy righteousness 6928 let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous 6929 but i am poor and sorrowful let thy salvation o god set me up on high 6930 i will praise the name of god with a song and will magnify him with thanksgiving 6931 this also shall please the lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs 6932 the humble shall see this and be glad and your heart shall live that seek god 6933 for the lord heareth the poor and despiseth not his prisoners 6934 let the heaven and earth praise him the seas and every thing that moveth therein 6935 for god will save zion and will build the cities of judah that they may dwell there and have it in possession 6936 the seed also of his servants shall inherit it and they that love his name shall dwell therein 701 make haste o god to deliver me make haste to help me o lord 702 let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul let them be turned backward and put to confusion that desire my hurt 703 let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say aha aha 704 let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee and let such as love thy salvation say continually let god be magnified 705 but i am poor and needy make haste unto me o god thou art my help and my deliverer o lord make no tarrying 711 in thee o lord do i put my trust let me never be put to confusion 712 deliver me in thy righteousness and cause me to escape incline thine ear unto me and save me 713 be thou my strong habitation whereunto i may continually resort thou hast given commandment to save me for thou art my rock and my fortress 714 deliver me o my god out of the hand of the wicked out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man 715 for thou art my hope o lord god thou art my trust from my youth 716 by thee have i been holden up from the womb thou art he that took me out of my mothers bowels my praise shall be continually of thee 717 i am as a wonder unto many but thou art my strong refuge 718 let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day 719 cast me not off in the time of old age forsake me not when my strength faileth 7110 for mine enemies speak against me and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together 7111 saying god hath forsaken him persecute and take him for there is none to deliver him 7112 o god be not far from me o my god make haste for my help 7113 let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt 7114 but i will hope continually and will yet praise thee more and more 7115 my mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day for i know not the numbers thereof 7116 i will go in the strength of the lord god i will make mention of thy righteousness even of thine only 7117 o god thou hast taught me from my youth and hitherto have i declared thy wondrous works 7118 now also when i am old and greyheaded o god forsake me not until i have shewed thy strength unto this generation and thy power to every one that is to come 7119 thy righteousness also o god is very high who hast done great things o god who is like unto thee 7120 thou which hast shewed me great and sore troubles shalt quicken me again and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth 7121 thou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me on every side 7122 i will also praise thee with the psaltery even thy truth o my god unto thee will i sing with the harp o thou holy one of israel 7123 my lips shall greatly rejoice when i sing unto thee and my soul which thou hast redeemed 7124 my tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long for they are confounded for they are brought unto shame that seek my hurt 721 give the king thy judgments o god and thy righteousness unto the kings son 722 he shall judge thy people with righteousness and thy poor with judgment 723 the mountains shall bring peace to the people and the little hills by righteousness 724 he shall judge the poor of the people he shall save the children of the needy and shall break in pieces the oppressor 725 they shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure throughout all generations 726 he shall come down like rain upon the mown grass as showers that water the earth 727 in his days shall the righteous flourish and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth 728 he shall have dominion also from sea to sea and from the river unto the ends of the earth 729 they that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him and his enemies shall lick the dust 7210 the kings of tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents the kings of sheba and seba shall offer gifts 7211 yea all kings shall fall down before him all nations shall serve him 7212 for he shall deliver the needy when he crieth the poor also and him that hath no helper 7213 he shall spare the poor and needy and shall save the souls of the needy 7214 he shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence and precious shall their blood be in his sight 7215 and he shall live and to him shall be given of the gold of sheba prayer also shall be made for him continually and daily shall he be praised 7216 there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains the fruit thereof shall shake like lebanon and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth 7217 his name shall endure for ever his name shall be continued as long as the sun and men shall be blessed in him all nations shall call him blessed 7218 blessed be the lord god the god of israel who only doeth wondrous things 7219 and blessed be his glorious name for ever and let the whole earth be filled with his glory amen and amen 7220 the prayers of david the son of jesse are ended 731 truly god is good to israel even to such as are of a clean heart 732 but as for me my feet were almost gone my steps had well nigh slipped 733 for i was envious at the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked 734 for there are no bands in their death but their strength is firm 735 they are not in trouble as other men neither are they plagued like other men 736 therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain violence covereth them as a garment 737 their eyes stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wish 738 they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they speak loftily 739 they set their mouth against the heavens and their tongue walketh through the earth 7310 therefore his people return hither and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them 7311 and they say how doth god know and is there knowledge in the most high 7312 behold these are the ungodly who prosper in the world they increase in riches 7313 verily i have cleansed my heart in vain and washed my hands in innocency 7314 for all the day long have i been plagued and chastened every morning 7315 if i say i will speak thus behold i should offend against the generation of thy children 7316 when i thought to know this it was too painful for me 7317 until i went into the sanctuary of god then understood i their end 7318 surely thou didst set them in slippery places thou castedst them down into destruction 7319 how are they brought into desolation as in a moment they are utterly consumed with terrors 7320 as a dream when one awaketh so o lord when thou awakest thou shalt despise their image 7321 thus my heart was grieved and i was pricked in my reins 7322 so foolish was i and ignorant i was as a beast before thee 7323 nevertheless i am continually with thee thou hast holden me by my right hand 7324 thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to glory 7325 whom have i in heaven but thee and there is none upon earth that i desire beside thee 7326 my flesh and my heart faileth but god is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever 7327 for lo they that are far from thee shall perish thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee 7328 but it is good for me to draw near to god i have put my trust in the lord god that i may declare all thy works 741 o god why hast thou cast us off for ever why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture 742 remember thy congregation which thou hast purchased of old the rod of thine inheritance which thou hast redeemed this mount zion wherein thou hast dwelt 743 lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary 744 thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations they set up their ensigns for signs 745 a man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees 746 but now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers 747 they have cast fire into thy sanctuary they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground 748 they said in their hearts let us destroy them together they have burned up all the synagogues of god in the land 749 we see not our signs there is no more any prophet neither is there among us any that knoweth how long 7410 o god how long shall the adversary reproach shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever 7411 why withdrawest thou thy hand even thy right hand pluck it out of thy bosom 7412 for god is my king of old working salvation in the midst of the earth 7413 thou didst divide the sea by thy strength thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters 7414 thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness 7415 thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood thou driedst up mighty rivers 7416 the day is thine the night also is thine thou hast prepared the light and the sun 7417 thou hast set all the borders of the earth thou hast made summer and winter 7418 remember this that the enemy hath reproached o lord and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name 7419 o deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever 7420 have respect unto the covenant for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty 7421 o let not the oppressed return ashamed let the poor and needy praise thy name 7422 arise o god plead thine own cause remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily 7423 forget not the voice of thine enemies the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually 751 unto thee o god do we give thanks unto thee do we give thanks for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare 752 when i shall receive the congregation i will judge uprightly 753 the earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved i bear up the pillars of it selah 754 i said unto the fools deal not foolishly and to the wicked lift not up the horn 755 lift not up your horn on high speak not with a stiff neck 756 for promotion cometh neither from the east nor from the west nor from the south 757 but god is the judge he putteth down one and setteth up another 758 for in the hand of the lord there is a cup and the wine is red it is full of mixture and he poureth out of the same but the dregs thereof all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out and drink them 759 but i will declare for ever i will sing praises to the god of jacob 7510 all the horns of the wicked also will i cut off but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted 761 in judah is god known his name is great in israel 762 in salem also is his tabernacle and his dwelling place in zion 763 there brake he the arrows of the bow the shield and the sword and the battle selah 764 thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey 765 the stouthearted are spoiled they have slept their sleep and none of the men of might have found their hands 766 at thy rebuke o god of jacob both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep 767 thou even thou art to be feared and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry 768 thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven the earth feared and was still 769 when god arose to judgment to save all the meek of the earth selah 7610 surely the wrath of man shall praise thee the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain 7611 vow and pay unto the lord your god let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared 7612 he shall cut off the spirit of princes he is terrible to the kings of the earth 771 i cried unto god with my voice even unto god with my voice and he gave ear unto me 772 in the day of my trouble i sought the lord my sore ran in the night and ceased not my soul refused to be comforted 773 i remembered god and was troubled i complained and my spirit was overwhelmed selah 774 thou holdest mine eyes waking i am so troubled that i cannot speak 775 i have considered the days of old the years of ancient times 776 i call to remembrance my song in the night i commune with mine own heart and my spirit made diligent search 777 will the lord cast off for ever and will he be favourable no more 778 is his mercy clean gone for ever doth his promise fail for evermore 779 hath god forgotten to be gracious hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies selah 7710 and i said this is my infirmity but i will remember the years of the right hand of the most high 7711 i will remember the works of the lord surely i will remember thy wonders of old 7712 i will meditate also of all thy work and talk of thy doings 7713 thy way o god is in the sanctuary who is so great a god as our god 7714 thou art the god that doest wonders thou hast declared thy strength among the people 7715 thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people the sons of jacob and joseph selah 7716 the waters saw thee o god the waters saw thee they were afraid the depths also were troubled 7717 the clouds poured out water the skies sent out a sound thine arrows also went abroad 7718 the voice of thy thunder was in the heaven the lightnings lightened the world the earth trembled and shook 7719 thy way is in the sea and thy path in the great waters and thy footsteps are not known 7720 thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron 781 give ear o my people to my law incline your ears to the words of my mouth 782 i will open my mouth in a parable i will utter dark sayings of old 783 which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us 784 we will not hide them from their children shewing to the generation to come the praises of the lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he hath done 785 for he established a testimony in jacob and appointed a law in israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children 786 that the generation to come might know them even the children which should be born who should arise and declare them to their children 787 that they might set their hope in god and not forget the works of god but keep his commandments 788 and might not be as their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation a generation that set not their heart aright and whose spirit was not stedfast with god 789 the children of ephraim being armed and carrying bows turned back in the day of battle 7810 they kept not the covenant of god and refused to walk in his law 7811 and forgat his works and his wonders that he had shewed them 7812 marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers in the land of egypt in the field of zoan 7813 he divided the sea and caused them to pass through and he made the waters to stand as an heap 7814 in the daytime also he led them with a cloud and all the night with a light of fire 7815 he clave the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as out of the great depths 7816 he brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers 7817 and they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most high in the wilderness 7818 and they tempted god in their heart by asking meat for their lust 7819 yea they spake against god they said can god furnish a table in the wilderness 7820 behold he smote the rock that the waters gushed out and the streams overflowed can he give bread also can he provide flesh for his people 7821 therefore the lord heard this and was wroth so a fire was kindled against jacob and anger also came up against israel 7822 because they believed not in god and trusted not in his salvation 7823 though he had commanded the clouds from above and opened the doors of heaven 7824 and had rained down manna upon them to eat and had given them of the corn of heaven 7825 man did eat angels food he sent them meat to the full 7826 he caused an east wind to blow in the heaven and by his power he brought in the south wind 7827 he rained flesh also upon them as dust and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea 7828 and he let it fall in the midst of their camp round about their habitations 7829 so they did eat and were well filled for he gave them their own desire 7830 they were not estranged from their lust but while their meat was yet in their mouths 7831 the wrath of god came upon them and slew the fattest of them and smote down the chosen men of israel 7832 for all this they sinned still and believed not for his wondrous works 7833 therefore their days did he consume in vanity and their years in trouble 7834 when he slew them then they sought him and they returned and enquired early after god 7835 and they remembered that god was their rock and the high god their redeemer 7836 nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth and they lied unto him with their tongues 7837 for their heart was not right with him neither were they stedfast in his covenant 7838 but he being full of compassion forgave their iniquity and destroyed them not yea many a time turned he his anger away and did not stir up all his wrath 7839 for he remembered that they were but flesh a wind that passeth away and cometh not again 7840 how oft did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert 7841 yea they turned back and tempted god and limited the holy one of israel 7842 they remembered not his hand nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy 7843 how he had wrought his signs in egypt and his wonders in the field of zoan 7844 and had turned their rivers into blood and their floods that they could not drink 7845 he sent divers sorts of flies among them which devoured them and frogs which destroyed them 7846 he gave also their increase unto the caterpiller and their labour unto the locust 7847 he destroyed their vines with hail and their sycomore trees with frost 7848 he gave up their cattle also to the hail and their flocks to hot thunderbolts 7849 he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger wrath and indignation and trouble by sending evil angels among them 7850 he made a way to his anger he spared not their soul from death but gave their life over to the pestilence 7851 and smote all the firstborn in egypt the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of ham 7852 but made his own people to go forth like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock 7853 and he led them on safely so that they feared not but the sea overwhelmed their enemies 7854 and he brought them to the border of his sanctuary even to this mountain which his right hand had purchased 7855 he cast out the heathen also before them and divided them an inheritance by line and made the tribes of israel to dwell in their tents 7856 yet they tempted and provoked the most high god and kept not his testimonies 7857 but turned back and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers they were turned aside like a deceitful bow 7858 for they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their graven images 7859 when god heard this he was wroth and greatly abhorred israel 7860 so that he forsook the tabernacle of shiloh the tent which he placed among men 7861 and delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into the enemys hand 7862 he gave his people over also unto the sword and was wroth with his inheritance 7863 the fire consumed their young men and their maidens were not given to marriage 7864 their priests fell by the sword and their widows made no lamentation 7865 then the lord awaked as one out of sleep and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine 7866 and he smote his enemies in the hinder parts he put them to a perpetual reproach 7867 moreover he refused the tabernacle of joseph and chose not the tribe of ephraim 7868 but chose the tribe of judah the mount zion which he loved 7869 and he built his sanctuary like high palaces like the earth which he hath established for ever 7870 he chose david also his servant and took him from the sheepfolds 7871 from following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed jacob his people and israel his inheritance 7872 so he fed them according to the integrity of his heart and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands 791 o god the heathen are come into thine inheritance thy holy temple have they defiled they have laid jerusalem on heaps 792 the dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat unto the fowls of the heaven the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth 793 their blood have they shed like water round about jerusalem and there was none to bury them 794 we are become a reproach to our neighbours a scorn and derision to them that are round about us 795 how long lord wilt thou be angry for ever shall thy jealousy burn like fire 796 pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name 797 for they have devoured jacob and laid waste his dwelling place 798 o remember not against us former iniquities let thy tender mercies speedily prevent us for we are brought very low 799 help us o god of our salvation for the glory of thy name and deliver us and purge away our sins for thy names sake 7910 wherefore should the heathen say where is their god let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed 7911 let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die 7912 and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach wherewith they have reproached thee o lord 7913 so we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever we will shew forth thy praise to all generations 801 give ear o shepherd of israel thou that leadest joseph like a flock thou that dwellest between the cherubims shine forth 802 before ephraim and benjamin and manasseh stir up thy strength and come and save us 803 turn us again o god and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved 804 o lord god of hosts how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people 805 thou feedest them with the bread of tears and givest them tears to drink in great measure 806 thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours and our enemies laugh among themselves 807 turn us again o god of hosts and cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved 808 thou hast brought a vine out of egypt thou hast cast out the heathen and planted it 809 thou preparedst room before it and didst cause it to take deep root and it filled the land 8010 the hills were covered with the shadow of it and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars 8011 she sent out her boughs unto the sea and her branches unto the river 8012 why hast thou then broken down her hedges so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her 8013 the boar out of the wood doth waste it and the wild beast of the field doth devour it 8014 return we beseech thee o god of hosts look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine 8015 and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself 8016 it is burned with fire it is cut down they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance 8017 let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself 8018 so will not we go back from thee quicken us and we will call upon thy name 8019 turn us again o lord god of hosts cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved 811 sing aloud unto god our strength make a joyful noise unto the god of jacob 812 take a psalm and bring hither the timbrel the pleasant harp with the psaltery 813 blow up the trumpet in the new moon in the time appointed on our solemn feast day 814 for this was a statute for israel and a law of the god of jacob 815 this he ordained in joseph for a testimony when he went out through the land of egypt where i heard a language that i understood not 816 i removed his shoulder from the burden his hands were delivered from the pots 817 thou calledst in trouble and i delivered thee i answered thee in the secret place of thunder i proved thee at the waters of meribah selah 818 hear o my people and i will testify unto thee o israel if thou wilt hearken unto me 819 there shall no strange god be in thee neither shalt thou worship any strange god 8110 i am the lord thy god which brought thee out of the land of egypt open thy mouth wide and i will fill it 8111 but my people would not hearken to my voice and israel would none of me 8112 so i gave them up unto their own hearts lust and they walked in their own counsels 8113 oh that my people had hearkened unto me and israel had walked in my ways 8114 i should soon have subdued their enemies and turned my hand against their adversaries 8115 the haters of the lord should have submitted themselves unto him but their time should have endured for ever 8116 he should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat and with honey out of the rock should i have satisfied thee 821 god standeth in the congregation of the mighty he judgeth among the gods 822 how long will ye judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked selah 823 defend the poor and fatherless do justice to the afflicted and needy 824 deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the wicked 825 they know not neither will they understand they walk on in darkness all the foundations of the earth are out of course 826 i have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high 827 but ye shall die like men and fall like one of the princes 828 arise o god judge the earth for thou shalt inherit all nations 831 keep not thou silence o god hold not thy peace and be not still o god 832 for lo thine enemies make a tumult and they that hate thee have lifted up the head 833 they have taken crafty counsel against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones 834 they have said come and let us cut them off from being a nation that the name of israel may be no more in remembrance 835 for they have consulted together with one consent they are confederate against thee 836 the tabernacles of edom and the ishmaelites of moab and the hagarenes 837 gebal and ammon and amalek the philistines with the inhabitants of tyre 838 assur also is joined with them they have holpen the children of lot selah 839 do unto them as unto the midianites as to sisera as to jabin at the brook of kison 8310 which perished at endor they became as dung for the earth 8311 make their nobles like oreb and like zeeb yea all their princes as zebah and as zalmunna 8312 who said let us take to ourselves the houses of god in possession 8313 o my god make them like a wheel as the stubble before the wind 8314 as the fire burneth a wood and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire 8315 so persecute them with thy tempest and make them afraid with thy storm 8316 fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name o lord 8317 let them be confounded and troubled for ever yea let them be put to shame and perish 8318 that men may know that thou whose name alone is jehovah art the most high over all the earth 841 how amiable are thy tabernacles o lord of hosts 842 my soul longeth yea even fainteth for the courts of the lord my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living god 843 yea the sparrow hath found an house and the swallow a nest for herself where she may lay her young even thine altars o lord of hosts my king and my god 844 blessed are they that dwell in thy house they will be still praising thee selah 845 blessed is the man whose strength is in thee in whose heart are the ways of them 846 who passing through the valley of baca make it a well the rain also filleth the pools 847 they go from strength to strength every one of them in zion appeareth before god 848 o lord god of hosts hear my prayer give ear o god of jacob selah 849 behold o god our shield and look upon the face of thine anointed 8410 for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand i had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my god than to dwell in the tents of wickedness 8411 for the lord god is a sun and shield the lord will give grace and glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly 8412 o lord of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth in thee 851 lord thou hast been favourable unto thy land thou hast brought back the captivity of jacob 852 thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou hast covered all their sin selah 853 thou hast taken away all thy wrath thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger 854 turn us o god of our salvation and cause thine anger toward us to cease 855 wilt thou be angry with us for ever wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations 856 wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee 857 shew us thy mercy o lord and grant us thy salvation 858 i will hear what god the lord will speak for he will speak peace unto his people and to his saints but let them not turn again to folly 859 surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him that glory may dwell in our land 8510 mercy and truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other 8511 truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven 8512 yea the lord shall give that which is good and our land shall yield her increase 8513 righteousness shall go before him and shall set us in the way of his steps 861 bow down thine ear o lord hear me for i am poor and needy 862 preserve my soul for i am holy o thou my god save thy servant that trusteth in thee 863 be merciful unto me o lord for i cry unto thee daily 864 rejoice the soul of thy servant for unto thee o lord do i lift up my soul 865 for thou lord art good and ready to forgive and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee 866 give ear o lord unto my prayer and attend to the voice of my supplications 867 in the day of my trouble i will call upon thee for thou wilt answer me 868 among the gods there is none like unto thee o lord neither are there any works like unto thy works 869 all nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee o lord and shall glorify thy name 8610 for thou art great and doest wondrous things thou art god alone 8611 teach me thy way o lord i will walk in thy truth unite my heart to fear thy name 8612 i will praise thee o lord my god with all my heart and i will glorify thy name for evermore 8613 for great is thy mercy toward me and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell 8614 o god the proud are risen against me and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul and have not set thee before them 8615 but thou o lord art a god full of compassion and gracious long suffering and plenteous in mercy and truth 8616 o turn unto me and have mercy upon me give thy strength unto thy servant and save the son of thine handmaid 8617 shew me a token for good that they which hate me may see it and be ashamed because thou lord hast holpen me and comforted me 871 his foundation is in the holy mountains 872 the lord loveth the gates of zion more than all the dwellings of jacob 873 glorious things are spoken of thee o city of god selah 874 i will make mention of rahab and babylon to them that know me behold philistia and tyre with ethiopia this man was born there 875 and of zion it shall be said this and that man was born in her and the highest himself shall establish her 876 the lord shall count when he writeth up the people that this man was born there selah 877 as well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there all my springs are in thee 881 o lord god of my salvation i have cried day and night before thee 882 let my prayer come before thee incline thine ear unto my cry 883 for my soul is full of troubles and my life draweth nigh unto the grave 884 i am counted with them that go down into the pit i am as a man that hath no strength 885 free among the dead like the slain that lie in the grave whom thou rememberest no more and they are cut off from thy hand 886 thou hast laid me in the lowest pit in darkness in the deeps 887 thy wrath lieth hard upon me and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves selah 888 thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me thou hast made me an abomination unto them i am shut up and i cannot come forth 889 mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction lord i have called daily upon thee i have stretched out my hands unto thee 8810 wilt thou shew wonders to the dead shall the dead arise and praise thee selah 8811 shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave or thy faithfulness in destruction 8812 shall thy wonders be known in the dark and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness 8813 but unto thee have i cried o lord and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee 8814 lord why castest thou off my soul why hidest thou thy face from me 8815 i am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up while i suffer thy terrors i am distracted 8816 thy fierce wrath goeth over me thy terrors have cut me off 8817 they came round about me daily like water they compassed me about together 8818 lover and friend hast thou put far from me and mine acquaintance into darkness 891 i will sing of the mercies of the lord for ever with my mouth will i make known thy faithfulness to all generations 892 for i have said mercy shall be built up for ever thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens 893 i have made a covenant with my chosen i have sworn unto david my servant 894 thy seed will i establish for ever and build up thy throne to all generations selah 895 and the heavens shall praise thy wonders o lord thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints 896 for who in the heaven can be compared unto the lord who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the lord 897 god is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him 898 o lord god of hosts who is a strong lord like unto thee or to thy faithfulness round about thee 899 thou rulest the raging of the sea when the waves thereof arise thou stillest them 8910 thou hast broken rahab in pieces as one that is slain thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm 8911 the heavens are thine the earth also is thine as for the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded them 8912 the north and the south thou hast created them tabor and hermon shall rejoice in thy name 8913 thou hast a mighty arm strong is thy hand and high is thy right hand 8914 justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne mercy and truth shall go before thy face 8915 blessed is the people that know the joyful sound they shall walk o lord in the light of thy countenance 8916 in thy name shall they rejoice all the day and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted 8917 for thou art the glory of their strength and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted 8918 for the lord is our defence and the holy one of israel is our king 8919 then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one and saidst i have laid help upon one that is mighty i have exalted one chosen out of the people 8920 i have found david my servant with my holy oil have i anointed him 8921 with whom my hand shall be established mine arm also shall strengthen him 8922 the enemy shall not exact upon him nor the son of wickedness afflict him 8923 and i will beat down his foes before his face and plague them that hate him 8924 but my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him and in my name shall his horn be exalted 8925 i will set his hand also in the sea and his right hand in the rivers 8926 he shall cry unto me thou art my father my god and the rock of my salvation 8927 also i will make him my firstborn higher than the kings of the earth 8928 my mercy will i keep for him for evermore and my covenant shall stand fast with him 8929 his seed also will i make to endure for ever and his throne as the days of heaven 8930 if his children forsake my law and walk not in my judgments 8931 if they break my statutes and keep not my commandments 8932 then will i visit their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes 8933 nevertheless my lovingkindness will i not utterly take from him nor suffer my faithfulness to fail 8934 my covenant will i not break nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips 8935 once have i sworn by my holiness that i will not lie unto david 8936 his seed shall endure for ever and his throne as the sun before me 8937 it shall be established for ever as the moon and as a faithful witness in heaven selah 8938 but thou hast cast off and abhorred thou hast been wroth with thine anointed 8939 thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground 8940 thou hast broken down all his hedges thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin 8941 all that pass by the way spoil him he is a reproach to his neighbours 8942 thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice 8943 thou hast also turned the edge of his sword and hast not made him to stand in the battle 8944 thou hast made his glory to cease and cast his throne down to the ground 8945 the days of his youth hast thou shortened thou hast covered him with shame selah 8946 how long lord wilt thou hide thyself for ever shall thy wrath burn like fire 8947 remember how short my time is wherefore hast thou made all men in vain 8948 what man is he that liveth and shall not see death shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave selah 8949 lord where are thy former lovingkindnesses which thou swarest unto david in thy truth 8950 remember lord the reproach of thy servants how i do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people 8951 wherewith thine enemies have reproached o lord wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed 8952 blessed be the lord for evermore amen and amen 901 lord thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations 902 before the mountains were brought forth or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world even from everlasting to everlasting thou art god 903 thou turnest man to destruction and sayest return ye children of men 904 for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night 905 thou carriest them away as with a flood they are as a sleep in the morning they are like grass which groweth up 906 in the morning it flourisheth and groweth up in the evening it is cut down and withereth 907 for we are consumed by thine anger and by thy wrath are we troubled 908 thou hast set our iniquities before thee our secret sins in the light of thy countenance 909 for all our days are passed away in thy wrath we spend our years as a tale that is told 9010 the days of our years are threescore years and ten and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years yet is their strength labour and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away 9011 who knoweth the power of thine anger even according to thy fear so is thy wrath 9012 so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom 9013 return o lord how long and let it repent thee concerning thy servants 9014 o satisfy us early with thy mercy that we may rejoice and be glad all our days 9015 make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us and the years wherein we have seen evil 9016 let thy work appear unto thy servants and thy glory unto their children 9017 and let the beauty of the lord our god be upon us and establish thou the work of our hands upon us yea the work of our hands establish thou it 911 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty 912 i will say of the lord he is my refuge and my fortress my god in him will i trust 913 surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the noisome pestilence 914 he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shalt thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and buckler 915 thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day 916 nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday 917 a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee 918 only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked 919 because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation 9110 there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling 9111 for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways 9112 they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone 9113 thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet 9114 because he hath set his love upon me therefore will i deliver him i will set him on high because he hath known my name 9115 he shall call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honour him 9116 with long life will i satisfy him and shew him my salvation 921 it is a good thing to give thanks unto the lord and to sing praises unto thy name o most high 922 to shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning and thy faithfulness every night 923 upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery upon the harp with a solemn sound 924 for thou lord hast made me glad through thy work i will triumph in the works of thy hands 925 o lord how great are thy works and thy thoughts are very deep 926 a brutish man knoweth not neither doth a fool understand this 927 when the wicked spring as the grass and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish it is that they shall be destroyed for ever 928 but thou lord art most high for evermore 929 for lo thine enemies o lord for lo thine enemies shall perish all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered 9210 but my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn i shall be anointed with fresh oil 9211 mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me 9212 the righteous shall flourish like the palm tree he shall grow like a cedar in lebanon 9213 those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god 9214 they shall still bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing 9215 to shew that the lord is upright he is my rock and there is no unrighteousness in him 931 the lord reigneth he is clothed with majesty the lord is clothed with strength wherewith he hath girded himself the world also is stablished that it cannot be moved 932 thy throne is established of old thou art from everlasting 933 the floods have lifted up o lord the floods have lifted up their voice the floods lift up their waves 934 the lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters yea than the mighty waves of the sea 935 thy testimonies are very sure holiness becometh thine house o lord for ever 941 o lord god to whom vengeance belongeth o god to whom vengeance belongeth shew thyself 942 lift up thyself thou judge of the earth render a reward to the proud 943 lord how long shall the wicked how long shall the wicked triumph 944 how long shall they utter and speak hard things and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves 945 they break in pieces thy people o lord and afflict thine heritage 946 they slay the widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless 947 yet they say the lord shall not see neither shall the god of jacob regard it 948 understand ye brutish among the people and ye fools when will ye be wise 949 he that planted the ear shall he not hear he that formed the eye shall he not see 9410 he that chastiseth the heathen shall not he correct he that teacheth man knowledge shall not he know 9411 the lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are vanity 9412 blessed is the man whom thou chastenest o lord and teachest him out of thy law 9413 that thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity until the pit be digged for the wicked 9414 for the lord will not cast off his people neither will he forsake his inheritance 9415 but judgment shall return unto righteousness and all the upright in heart shall follow it 9416 who will rise up for me against the evildoers or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity 9417 unless the lord had been my help my soul had almost dwelt in silence 9418 when i said my foot slippeth thy mercy o lord held me up 9419 in the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul 9420 shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee which frameth mischief by a law 9421 they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous and condemn the innocent blood 9422 but the lord is my defence and my god is the rock of my refuge 9423 and he shall bring upon them their own iniquity and shall cut them off in their own wickedness yea the lord our god shall cut them off 951 o come let us sing unto the lord let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation 952 let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms 953 for the lord is a great god and a great king above all gods 954 in his hand are the deep places of the earth the strength of the hills is his also 955 the sea is his and he made it and his hands formed the dry land 956 o come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the lord our maker 957 for he is our god and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand to day if ye will hear his voice 958 harden not your heart as in the provocation and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness 959 when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my work 9510 forty years long was i grieved with this generation and said it is a people that do err in their heart and they have not known my ways 9511 unto whom i sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest 961 o sing unto the lord a new song sing unto the lord all the earth 962 sing unto the lord bless his name shew forth his salvation from day to day 963 declare his glory among the heathen his wonders among all people 964 for the lord is great and greatly to be praised he is to be feared above all gods 965 for all the gods of the nations are idols but the lord made the heavens 966 honour and majesty are before him strength and beauty are in his sanctuary 967 give unto the lord o ye kindreds of the people give unto the lord glory and strength 968 give unto the lord the glory due unto his name bring an offering and come into his courts 969 o

the people righteously 9611 let the heavens rejoice and let the earth be glad let the sea roar and the fulness thereof 9612 let the field be joyful and all that is therein then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice 9613 before the lord for he cometh for he cometh to judge the earth he shall judge the world with righteousness and the people with his truth 971 the lord reigneth let the earth rejoice let the multitude of isles be glad thereof 972 clouds and darkness are round about him righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne 973 a fire goeth before him and burneth up his enemies round about 974 his lightnings enlightened the world the earth saw and trembled 975 the hills melted like wax at the presence of the lord at the presence of the lord of the whole earth 976 the heavens declare his righteousness and all the people see his glory 977 confounded be all they that serve graven images that boast themselves of idols worship him all ye gods 978 zion heard and was glad and the daughters of judah rejoiced because of thy judgments o lord 979 for thou lord art high above all the earth thou art exalted far above all gods 9710 ye that love the lord hate evil he preserveth the souls of his saints he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked 9711 light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart 9712 rejoice in the lord ye righteous and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness 981 o sing unto the lord a new song for he hath done marvellous things his right hand and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory 982 the lord hath made known his salvation his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen 983 he hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of israel all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our god 984 make a joyful noise unto the lord all the earth make a loud noise and rejoice and sing praise 985 sing unto the lord with the harp with the harp and the voice of a psalm

hands let the hills be joyful together 989 before the lord for he cometh to judge the earth with righteousness shall he judge the world and the people with equity 991 the lord reigneth let the people tremble he sitteth between the cherubims let the earth be moved 992 the lord is great in zion and he is high above all the people 993 let them praise thy great and terrible name for it is holy 994 the kings strength also loveth judgment thou dost establish equity thou executest judgment and righteousness in jacob 995 exalt ye the lord our god and worship at his footstool for he is holy 996 moses and aaron among his priests and samuel among them that call upon his name they called upon the lord and he answered them 997 he spake unto them in the cloudy pillar they kept his testimonies and the ordinance that he gave them 998 thou answeredst them o lord our god thou wast a god that forgavest them though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions 999 exalt the lord our god and worship at his holy hill for the lord our god is holy 1001 make a joyful noise unto the lord all ye lands 1002 serve the lord with gladness come before his presence with singing 1003 know ye that the lord he is god it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the sheep of his pasture 1004 enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name 1005 for the lord is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations 1011 i will sing of mercy and judgment unto thee o lord will i sing 1012 i will behave myself wisely in a perfect way o when wilt thou come unto me i will walk within my house with a perfect heart 1013 i will set no wicked thing before mine eyes i hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me 1014 a froward heart shall depart from me i will not know a wicked person 1015 whoso privily slandereth his neighbour him will i cut off him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not i suffer 1016 mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land that they may dwell with me he that walketh in a perfect way he shall serve me 1017 he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight 1018 i will early destroy all the wicked of the land that i may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the lord 1021 hear my prayer o lord and let my cry come unto thee 1022 hide not thy face from me in the day when i am in trouble incline thine ear unto me in the day when i call answer me speedily 1023 for my days are consumed like smoke and my bones are burned as an hearth 1024 my heart is smitten and withered like grass so that i forget to eat my bread 1025 by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin 1026 i am like a pelican of the wilderness i am like an owl of the desert 1027 i watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top 1028 mine enemies reproach me all the day and they that are mad against me are sworn against me 1029 for i have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping 10210 because of thine indignation and thy wrath for thou hast lifted me up and cast me down 10211 my days are like a shadow that declineth and i am withered like grass 10212 but thou o lord shall endure for ever and thy remembrance unto all generations 10213 thou shalt arise and have mercy upon zion for the time to favour her yea the set time is come 10214 for thy servants take pleasure in her stones and favour the dust thereof 10215 so the heathen shall fear the name of the lord and all the kings of the earth thy glory 10216 when the lord shall build up zion he shall appear in his glory 10217 he will regard the prayer of the destitute and not despise their prayer 10218 this shall be written for the generation to come and the people which shall be created shall praise the lord 10219 for he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary from heaven did the lord behold the earth 10220 to hear the groaning of the prisoner to loose those that are appointed to death 10221 to declare the name of the lord in zion and his praise in jerusalem 10222 when the people are gathered together and the kingdoms to serve the lord 10223 he weakened my strength in the way he shortened my days 10224 i said o my god take me not away in the midst of my days thy years are throughout all generations 10225 of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of thy hands 10226 they shall perish but thou shalt endure yea all of them shall wax old like a garment as a vesture shalt thou change them and they shall be changed 10227 but thou art the same and thy years shall have no end 10228 the children of thy servants shall continue and their seed shall be established before thee 1031 bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name 1032 bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits 1033 who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases 1034 who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies 1035 who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles 1036 the lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed 1037 he made known his ways unto moses his acts unto the children of israel 1038 the lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in mercy 1039 he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger for ever 10310 he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities 10311 for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him 10312 as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us 10313 like as a father pitieth his children so the lord pitieth them that fear him 10314 for he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dust 10315 as for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourisheth 10316 for the wind passeth over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more 10317 but the mercy of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto childrens children 10318 to such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his commandments to do them 10319 the lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom ruleth over all 10320 bless the lord ye his angels that excel in strength that do his commandments hearkening unto the voice of his word 10321 bless ye the lord all ye his hosts ye ministers of his that do his pleasure 10322 bless the lord all his works in all places of his dominion bless the lord o my soul 1041 bless the lord o my soul o lord my god thou art very great thou art clothed with honour and majesty 1042 who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain 1043 who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters who maketh the clouds his chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind 1044 who maketh his angels spirits his ministers a flaming fire 1045 who laid the foundations of the earth that it should not be removed for ever 1046 thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment the waters stood above the mountains 1047 at thy rebuke they fled at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away 1048 they go up by the mountains they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them 1049 thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over that they turn not again to cover the earth 10410 he sendeth the springs into the valleys which run among the hills 10411 they give drink to every beast of the field the wild asses quench their thirst 10412 by them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation which sing among the branches 10413 he watereth the hills from his chambers the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works 10414 he causeth the grass to grow for the cattle and herb for the service of man that he may bring forth food out of the earth 10415 and wine that maketh glad the heart of man and oil to make his face to shine and bread which strengtheneth mans heart 10416 the trees of the lord are full of sap the cedars of lebanon which he hath planted 10417 where the birds make their nests as for the stork the fir trees are her house 10418 the high hills are a refuge for the wild goats and the rocks for the conies 10419 he appointed the moon for seasons the sun knoweth his going down 10420 thou makest darkness and it is night wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth 10421 the young lions roar after their prey and seek their meat from god 10422 the sun ariseth they gather themselves together and lay them down in their dens 10423 man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening 10424 o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all the earth is full of thy riches 10425 so is this great and wide sea wherein are things creeping innumerable both small and great beasts 10426 there go the ships there is that leviathan whom thou hast made to play therein 10427 these wait all upon thee that thou mayest give them their meat in due season 10428 that thou givest them they gather thou openest thine hand they are filled with good 10429 thou hidest thy face they are troubled thou takest away their breath they die and return to their dust 10430 thou sendest forth thy spirit they are created and thou renewest the face of the earth 10431 the glory of the lord shall endure for ever the lord shall rejoice in his works 10432 he looketh on the earth and it trembleth he toucheth the hills and they smoke 10433 i will sing unto the lord as long as i live i will sing praise to my god while i have my being 10434 my meditation of him shall be sweet i will be glad in the lord 10435 let the sinners be consumed out of the earth and let the wicked be no more bless thou the lord o my soul praise ye the lord 1051 o give thanks unto the lord call upon his name make known his deeds among the people 1052 sing unto him sing psalms unto him talk ye of all his wondrous works 1053 glory ye in his holy name let the heart of them rejoice that seek the lord 1054 seek the lord and his strength seek his face evermore 1055 remember his marvellous works that he hath done his wonders and the judgments of his mouth 1056 o ye seed of abraham his servant ye children of jacob his chosen 1057 he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth 1058 he hath remembered his covenant for ever the word which he commanded to a thousand generations 1059 which covenant he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac 10510 and confirmed the same unto jacob for a law and to israel for an everlasting covenant 10511 saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance 10512 when they were but a few men in number yea very few and strangers in it 10513 when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to another people 10514 he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their sakes 10515 saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm 10516 moreover he called for a famine upon the land he brake the whole staff of bread 10517 he sent a man before them even joseph who was sold for a servant 10518 whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron 10519 until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him 10520 the king sent and loosed him even the ruler of the people and let him go free 10521 he made him lord of his house and ruler of all his substance 10522 to bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his senators wisdom 10523 israel also came into egypt and jacob sojourned in the land of ham 10524 and he increased his people greatly and made them stronger than their enemies 10525 he turned their heart to hate his people to deal subtilly with his servants 10526 he sent moses his servant and aaron whom he had chosen 10527 they shewed his signs among them and wonders in the land of ham 10528 he sent darkness and made it dark and they rebelled not against his word 10529 he turned their waters into blood and slew their fish 10530 their land brought forth frogs in abundance in the chambers of their kings 10531 he spake and there came divers sorts of flies and lice in all their coasts 10532 he gave them hail for rain and flaming fire in their land 10533 he smote their vines also and their fig trees and brake the trees of their coasts 10534 he spake and the locusts came and caterpillers and that without number 10535 and did eat up all the herbs in their land and devoured the fruit of their ground 10536 he smote also all the firstborn in their land the chief of all their strength 10537 he brought them forth also with silver and gold and there was not one feeble person among their tribes 10538 egypt was glad when they departed for the fear of them fell upon them 10539 he spread a cloud for a covering and fire to give light in the night 10540 the people asked and he brought quails and satisfied them with the bread of heaven 10541 he opened the rock and the waters gushed out they ran in the dry places like a river 10542 for he remembered his holy promise and abraham his servant 10543 and he brought forth his people with joy and his chosen with gladness 10544 and gave them the lands of the heathen and they inherited the labour of the people 10545 that they might observe his statutes and keep his laws praise ye the lord 1061 praise ye the lord o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever 1062 who can utter the mighty acts of the lord who can shew forth all his praise 1063 blessed are they that keep judgment and he that doeth righteousness at all times 1064 remember me o lord with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people o visit me with thy salvation 1065 that i may see the good of thy chosen that i may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation that i may glory with thine inheritance 1066 we have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we have done wickedly 1067 our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the sea even at the red sea 1068 nevertheless he saved them for his names sake that he might make his mighty power to be known 1069 he rebuked the red sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through the wilderness 10610 and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy 10611 and the waters covered their enemies there was not one of them left 10612 then believed they his words they sang his praise 10613 they soon forgat his works they waited not for his counsel 10614 but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted god in the desert 10615 and he gave them their request but sent leanness into their soul 10616 they envied moses also in the camp and aaron the saint of the lord 10617 the earth opened and swallowed up dathan and covered the company of abiram 10618 and a fire was kindled in their company the flame burned up the wicked 10619 they made a calf in horeb and worshipped the molten image 10620 thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass 10621 they forgat god their saviour which had done great things in egypt 10622 wondrous works in the land of ham and terrible things by the red sea 10623 therefore he said that he would destroy them had not moses his chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy them 10624 yea they despised the pleasant land they believed not his word 10625 but murmured in their tents and hearkened not unto the voice of the lord 10626 therefore he lifted up his hand against them to overthrow them in the wilderness 10627 to overthrow their seed also among the nations and to scatter them in the lands 10628 they joined themselves also unto baalpeor and ate the sacrifices of the dead 10629 thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions and the plague brake in upon them 10630 then stood up phinehas and executed judgment and so the plague was stayed 10631 and that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore 10632 they angered him also at the waters of strife so that it went ill with moses for their sakes 10633 because they provoked his spirit so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips 10634 they did not destroy the nations concerning whom the lord commanded them 10635 but were mingled among the heathen and learned their works 10636 and they served their idols which were a snare unto them 10637 yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils 10638 and shed innocent blood even the blood of their sons and of their daughters whom they sacrificed unto the idols of canaan and the land was polluted with blood 10639 thus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoring with their own inventions 10640 therefore was the wrath of the lord kindled against his people insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance 10641 and he gave them into the hand of the heathen and they that hated them ruled over them 10642 their enemies also oppressed them and they were brought into subjection under their hand 10643 many times did he deliver them but they provoked him with their counsel and were brought low for their iniquity 10644 nevertheless he regarded their affliction when he heard their cry 10645 and he remembered for them his covenant and repented according to the multitude of his mercies 10646 he made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives 10647 save us o lord our god and gather us from among the heathen to give thanks unto thy holy name and to triumph in thy praise 10648 blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting to everlasting and let all the people say amen praise ye the lord 1071 o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever 1072 let the redeemed of the lord say so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy 1073 and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west from the north and from the south 1074 they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no city to dwell in 1075 hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them 1076 then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses 1077 and he led them forth by the right way that they might go to a city of habitation 1078 oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men 1079 for he satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness 10710 such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound in affliction and iron 10711 because they rebelled against the words of god and contemned the counsel of the most high 10712 therefore he brought down their heart with labour they fell down and there was none to help 10713 then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he saved them out of their distresses 10714 he brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and brake their bands in sunder 10715 oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men 10716 for he hath broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunder 10717 fools because of their transgression and because of their iniquities are afflicted 10718 their soul abhorreth all manner of meat and they draw near unto the gates of death 10719 then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he saveth them out of their distresses 10720 he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions 10721 oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men 10722 and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving and declare his works with rejoicing 10723 they that go down to the sea in ships that do business in great waters 10724 these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep 10725 for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof 10726 they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble 10727 they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wits end 10728 then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses 10729 he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still 10730 then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven 10731 oh that men would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men 10732 let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people and praise him in the assembly of the elders 10733 he turneth rivers into a wilderness and the watersprings into dry ground 10734 a fruitful land into barrenness for the wickedness of them that dwell therein 10735 he turneth the wilderness into a standing water and dry ground into watersprings 10736 and there he maketh the hungry to dwell that they may prepare a city for habitation 10737 and sow the fields and plant vineyards which may yield fruits of increase 10738 he blesseth them also so that they are multiplied greatly and suffereth not their cattle to decrease 10739 again they are minished and brought low through oppression affliction and sorrow 10740 he poureth contempt upon princes and causeth them to wander in the wilderness where there is no way 10741 yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction and maketh him families like a flock 10742 the righteous shall see it and rejoice and all iniquity shall stop her mouth 10743 whoso is wise and will observe these things even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the lord 1081 o god my heart is fixed i will sing and give praise even with my glory 1082 awake psaltery and harp i myself will awake early 1083 i will praise thee o lord among the people and i will sing praises unto thee among the nations 1084 for thy mercy is great above the heavens and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds 1085 be thou exalted o god above the heavens and thy glory above all the earth 1086 that thy beloved may be delivered save with thy right hand and answer me 1087 god hath spoken in his holiness i will rejoice i will divide shechem and mete out the valley of succoth 1088 gilead is mine manasseh is mine ephraim also is the strength of mine head judah is my lawgiver 1089 moab is my washpot over edom will i cast out my shoe over philistia will i triumph 10810 who will bring me into the strong city who will lead me into edom 10811 wilt not thou o god who hast cast us off and wilt not thou o god go forth with our hosts 10812 give us help from trouble for vain is the help of man 10813 through god we shall do valiantly for he it is that shall tread down our enemies 1091 hold not thy peace o god of my praise 1092 for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me they have spoken against me with a lying tongue 1093 they compassed me about also with words of hatred and fought against me without a cause 1094 for my love they are my adversaries but i give myself unto prayer 1095 and they have rewarded me evil for good and hatred for my love 1096 set thou a wicked man over him and let satan stand at his right hand 1097 when he shall be judged let him be condemned and let his prayer become sin 1098 let his days be few and let another take his office 1099 let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow 10910 let his children be continually vagabonds and beg let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places 10911 let the extortioner catch all that he hath and let the strangers spoil his labour 10912 let there be none to extend mercy unto him neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children 10913 let his posterity be cut off and in the generation following let their name be blotted out 10914 let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the lord and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out 10915 let them be before the lord continually that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth 10916 because that he remembered not to shew mercy but persecuted the poor and needy man that he might even slay the broken in heart 10917 as he loved cursing so let it come unto him as he delighted not in blessing so let it be far from him 10918 as he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment so let it come into his bowels like water and like oil into his bones 10919 let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually 10920 let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the lord and of them that speak evil against my soul 10921 but do thou for me o god the lord for thy names sake because thy mercy is good deliver thou me 10922 for i am poor and needy and my heart is wounded within me 10923 i am gone like the shadow when it declineth i am tossed up and down as the locust 10924 my knees are weak through fasting and my flesh faileth of fatness 10925 i became also a reproach unto them when they looked upon me they shaked their heads 10926 help me o lord my god o save me according to thy mercy 10927 that they may know that this is thy hand that thou lord hast done it 10928 let them curse but bless thou when they arise let them be ashamed but let thy servant rejoice 10929 let mine adversaries be clothed with shame and let them cover themselves with their own confusion as with a mantle 10930 i will greatly praise the lord with my mouth yea i will praise him among the multitude 10931 for he shall stand at the right hand of the poor to save him from those that condemn his soul 1101 the lord said unto my lord sit thou at my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool 1102 the lord shall send the rod of thy strength out of zion rule thou in the midst of thine enemies 1103 thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning thou hast the dew of thy youth 1104 the lord hath sworn and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchizedek 1105 the lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the day of his wrath 1106 he shall judge among the heathen he shall fill the places with the dead bodies he shall wound the heads over many countries 1107 he shall drink of the brook in the way therefore shall he lift up the head 1111 praise ye the lord i will praise the lord with my whole heart in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation 1112 the works of the lord are great sought out of all them that have pleasure therein 1113 his work is honourable and glorious and his righteousness endureth for ever 1114 he hath made his wonderful works to be remembered the lord is gracious and full of compassion 1115 he hath given meat unto them that fear him he will ever be mindful of his covenant 1116 he hath shewed his people the power of his works that he may give them the heritage of the heathen 1117 the works of his hands are verity and judgment all his commandments are sure 1118 they stand fast for ever and ever and are done in truth and uprightness 1119 he sent redemption unto his people he hath commanded his covenant for ever holy and reverend is his name 11110 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom a good understanding have all they that do his commandments his praise endureth for ever 1121 praise ye the lord blessed is the man that feareth the lord that delighteth greatly in his commandments 1122 his seed shall be mighty upon earth the generation of the upright shall be blessed 1123 wealth and riches shall be in his house and his righteousness endureth for ever 1124 unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness he is gracious and full of compassion and righteous 1125 a good man sheweth favour and lendeth he will guide his affairs with discretion 1126 surely he shall not be moved for ever the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance 1127 he shall not be afraid of evil tidings his heart is fixed trusting in the lord 1128 his heart is established he shall not be afraid until he see his desire upon his enemies 1129 he hath dispersed he hath given to the poor his righteousness endureth for ever his horn shall be exalted with honour 11210 the wicked shall see it and be grieved he shall gnash with his teeth and melt away the desire of the wicked shall perish 1131 praise ye the lord praise o ye servants of the lord praise the name of the lord 1132 blessed be the name of the lord from this time forth and for evermore 1133 from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the lords name is to be praised 1134 the lord is high above all nations and his glory above the heavens 1135 who is like unto the lord our god who dwelleth on high 1136 who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and in the earth 1137 he raiseth up the poor out of the dust and lifteth the needy out of the dunghill 1138 that he may set him with princes even with the princes of his people 1139 he maketh the barren woman to keep house and to be a joyful mother of children praise ye the lord 1141 when israel went out of egypt the house of jacob from a people of strange language 1142 judah was his sanctuary and israel his dominion 1143 the sea saw it and fled jordan was driven back 1144 the mountains skipped like rams and the little hills like lambs 1145 what ailed thee o thou sea that thou fleddest thou jordan that thou wast driven back 1146 ye mountains that ye skipped like rams and ye little hills like lambs 1147 tremble thou earth at the presence of the lord at the presence of the god of jacob 1148 which turned the rock into a standing water the flint into a fountain of waters 1151 not unto us o lord not unto us but unto thy name give glory for thy mercy and for thy truths sake 1152 wherefore should the heathen say where is now their god 1153 but our god is in the heavens he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased 1154 their idols are silver and gold the work of mens hands 1155 they have mouths but they speak not eyes have they but they see not 1156 they have ears but they hear not noses have they but they smell not 1157 they have hands but they handle not feet have they but they walk not neither speak they through their throat 1158 they that make them are like unto them so is every one that trusteth in them 1159 o israel trust thou in the lord he is their help and their shield 11510 o house of aaron trust in the lord he is their help and their shield 11511

11516 the heaven even the heavens are the lords but the earth hath he given to the children of men 11517 the dead praise not the lord neither any that go down into silence 11518 but we will bless the lord from this time forth and for evermore praise the lord 1161 i love the lord because he hath heard my voice and my supplications 1162 because he hath inclined his ear unto me therefore will i call upon him as long as i live 1163 the sorrows of death compassed me and the pains of hell gat hold upon me i found trouble and sorrow 1164 then called i upon the name of the lord o lord i beseech thee deliver my soul 1165 gracious is the lord and righteous yea our god is merciful 1166 the lord preserveth the simple i was brought low and he helped me 1167 return unto thy rest o my soul for the lord

salvation and call upon the name of the lord 11614 i will pay my vows unto the lord now in the presence of all his people 11615 precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints 11616 o lord truly i am thy servant i am thy servant and the son of thine handmaid thou hast loosed my bonds 11617 i will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving and will call upon the name of the lord 11618 i will pay my vows unto the lord now in the presence of all his people 11619 in the courts of the lords house in the midst of thee o jerusalem praise ye the lord 1171 o praise the lord all ye

say that his mercy endureth for ever 1185 i called upon the lord in distress the lord answered me and set me in a large place 1186 the lord is on my side i will not fear what can man do unto me 1187 the lord taketh my part with them that help me therefore shall i see my desire upon them that hate me 1188 it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in man 1189 it is better to trust in the lord than to put confidence in princes 11810 all nations compassed me about but in the name of the lord will i destroy them 11811 they compassed me about yea they compassed me about but in the name of the lord i will destroy them 11812 they compassed me about like bees they are quenched as the fire of thorns for in the name of the lord i will destroy them 11813 thou hast thrust sore at me that i might fall but the lord helped me 11814 the lord is my strength and song and is become my salvation 11815 the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous the right hand of the lord doeth valiantly 11816 the right hand of the lord is exalted the right hand of the lord doeth valiantly 11817 i shall not die but live and declare the works of the lord 11818 the lord

righteous shall enter 11821 i will praise thee for thou hast heard me and art become my salvation 11822 the stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner 11823 this is the

undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the lord 1192 blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that seek him with the whole heart 1193 they also do no iniquity they walk in his ways 1194

shall be done unto thee thou false tongue 1204 sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of juniper 1205 woe is me that i sojourn in mesech that i dwell in the tents of kedar 1206 my soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace 1207 i am for peace but when i speak they are for war 1211 i will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help 1212 my help cometh from the lord which made heaven and earth 1213 he will not suffer thy foot to be moved he that keepeth thee will not slumber 1214 behold he that keepeth israel shall neither slumber nor sleep 1215 the lord is thy keeper the lord is thy shade upon thy right hand 1216 the sun shall not smite thee by day nor the moon by night 1217 the lord shall preserve thee from all evil he shall preserve thy soul 1218 the lord shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from this time forth and even for evermore 1221 i was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the lord 1222 our feet shall stand within thy gates o jerusalem 1223 jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together 1224 whither the tribes go up the tribes of the lord unto the testimony of israel to give thanks unto the name of the lord 1225 for there are set thrones of judgment the thrones of the house of david 1226 pray for the peace of jerusalem they shall prosper that love thee 1227 peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces 1228 for my brethren and companions sakes i will now say peace be within thee 1229 because of the house of the lord our god i will seek thy good 1231 unto thee lift i up mine eyes o thou that dwellest in the heavens 1232 behold as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress so our eyes wait upon the lord our god until that he have mercy upon us 1233 have mercy upon us o lord have mercy upon us for we are exceedingly filled with contempt 1234 our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease and with the contempt of the proud 1241 if it had not been the lord who was on our side now may israel say 1242 if it had not been the lord who was on our side when men rose up against us 1243 then they had swallowed us up quick when their wrath was kindled against us 1244 then the waters had overwhelmed us the stream had gone over our soul 1245 then the proud waters had gone over our soul 1246 blessed be the lord who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth 1247 our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers the snare is broken and we are escaped 1248 our help is in the name of the lord who made heaven and earth 1251 they that trust in the lord shall be as mount zion which cannot be removed but abideth for ever 1252 as the mountains are round about jerusalem so the lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever 1253 for the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity 1254 do good o lord unto those that be good and to them that are upright in their hearts 1255 as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways the lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity but peace shall be upon israel 1261 when the lord turned again the captivity of zion we were like them that dream 1262 then was our mouth filled with laughter and our tongue with singing then said they among the heathen the lord hath done great things for them 1263 the lord hath done great things for us whereof we are glad 1264 turn again our captivity o lord as the streams in the south 1265 they that sow in tears shall reap in joy 1266 he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him 1271 except the lord build the house they labour in vain that build it except the lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain 1272 it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep 1273 lo children are an heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward 1274 as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth 1275 happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate 1281 blessed is every one that feareth the lord that walketh in his ways 1282 for thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee 1283 thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house thy children like olive plants round about thy table 1284 behold that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the lord 1285 the lord shall bless thee out of zion and thou shalt see the good of jerusalem all the days of thy life 1286 yea thou shalt see thy childrens children and peace upon israel 1291 many a time have they afflicted me from my youth may israel now say 1292 many a time have they afflicted me from my youth yet they have not prevailed against me 1293 the plowers plowed upon my back they made long their furrows 1294 the lord is righteous he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked 1295 let them all be confounded and turned back that hate zion 1296 let them be as the grass upon the housetops which withereth afore it groweth up 1297 wherewith the mower filleth not his hand nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom 1298 neither do they which go by say the blessing of the lord be upon you we bless you in the name of the lord 1301 out of the depths have i cried unto thee o lord 1302 lord hear my voice let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications 1303 if thou lord shouldest mark iniquities o lord who shall stand 1304 but there is forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared 1305 i wait for the lord my soul doth wait and in his word do i hope 1306 my soul waiteth for the lord more than they that watch for the morning i say more than they that watch for the morning 1307 let israel hope in the lord for with the lord there is mercy and with him is plenteous redemption 1308 and he shall redeem israel from all his iniquities 1311 lord my heart is not haughty nor mine eyes lofty neither do i exercise myself in great matters or in things too high for me 1312 surely i have behaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother my soul is even as a weaned child 1313 let israel hope in the lord from henceforth and for ever 1321 lord remember david and all his afflictions 1322 how he sware unto the lord and vowed unto the mighty god of jacob 1323 surely i will not come into the tabernacle of my house nor go up into my bed 1324 i will not give sleep to mine eyes or slumber to mine eyelids 1325 until i find out a place for the lord an habitation for the mighty god of jacob 1326 lo we heard of it at ephratah we found it in the fields of the wood 1327 we will go into his tabernacles we will worship at his footstool 1328 arise o lord into thy rest thou and the ark of thy strength 1329 let thy priests be clothed with righteousness and let thy saints shout for joy 13210 for thy servant davids sake turn not away the face of thine anointed 13211 the lord hath sworn in truth unto david he will not turn from it of the fruit of thy body will i set upon thy throne 13212 if thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that i shall teach them their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore 13213 for the lord hath chosen zion he hath desired it for his habitation 13214 this is my rest for ever here will i dwell for i have desired it 13215 i will abundantly bless her provision i will satisfy her poor with bread 13216 i will also clothe her priests with salvation and her saints shall shout aloud for joy 13217 there will i make the horn of david to bud i have ordained a lamp for mine anointed 13218 his enemies will i clothe with shame but upon himself shall his crown flourish 1331 behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity 1332 it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even aarons beard that went down to the skirts of his garments 1333 as the dew of hermon and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of zion for there the lord commanded the blessing even life for evermore 1341 behold bless ye the lord all ye servants of the lord which by night stand in the house of the lord 1342 lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless the lord 1343 the lord that made heaven and earth bless thee out of zion 1351 praise ye the lord praise ye the name of the lord praise him o ye servants of the lord 1352 ye that stand in the house of the lord in the courts of the house of our god 1353 praise the lord for the lord is good sing praises unto his name for it is pleasant 1354 for the lord hath chosen jacob unto himself and israel for his peculiar treasure 1355 for i know that the lord is great and that our lord is above all gods 1356 whatsoever the lord pleased that did he in heaven and in earth in the seas and all deep places 1357 he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings for the rain he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries 1358 who smote the firstborn of egypt both of man and beast 1359 who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee o egypt upon pharaoh and upon all his servants 13510 who smote great nations and slew mighty kings 13511 sihon king of the amorites and og king of bashan and all the kingdoms of canaan 13512 and gave their land for an heritage an heritage unto israel his people 13513 thy name o lord endureth for ever and thy memorial o lord throughout all generations 13514 for the lord will judge his people and he will repent himself concerning his servants 13515 the idols of the heathen are silver and gold the work of mens hands 13516 they have mouths but they speak not eyes have they but they see not 13517 they have ears but they hear not neither is there any breath in their mouths 13518 they that make them are like unto them so is every one that trusteth in them 13519 bless the lord o house of israel bless the lord o house of aaron 13520 bless the lord o house of levi ye that fear the lord bless the lord 13521 blessed be the lord out of zion which dwelleth at jerusalem praise ye the lord 1361 o give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever 1362 o give thanks unto the god of gods for his mercy endureth for ever 1363 o give thanks to the lord of lords for his mercy endureth for ever 1364 to him who alone doeth great wonders for his mercy endureth for ever 1365 to him that by wisdom made the heavens for his mercy endureth for ever 1366 to him that stretched out the earth above the waters for his mercy endureth for ever 1367 to him that made great lights for his mercy endureth for ever 1368 the sun to rule by day for his mercy endureth for ever 1369 the moon and stars to rule by night for his mercy endureth for ever 13610 to him that smote egypt in their firstborn for his mercy endureth for ever 13611 and brought out israel from among them for his mercy endureth for ever 13612 with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm for his mercy endureth for ever 13613 to him which divided the red sea into parts for his mercy endureth for ever 13614 and made israel to pass through the midst of it for his mercy endureth for ever 13615 but overthrew pharaoh and his host in the red sea for his mercy endureth for ever 13616 to him which led his people through the wilderness for his mercy endureth for ever 13617 to him which smote great kings for his mercy endureth for ever 13618 and slew famous kings for his mercy endureth for ever 13619 sihon king of the amorites for his mercy endureth for ever 13620 and og the king of bashan for his mercy endureth for ever 13621 and gave their land for an heritage for his mercy endureth for ever 13622 even an heritage unto israel his servant for his mercy endureth for ever 13623 who remembered us in our low estate for his mercy endureth for ever 13624 and hath redeemed us from our enemies for his mercy endureth for ever 13625 who giveth food to all flesh for his mercy endureth for ever 13626 o give thanks unto the god of heaven for his mercy endureth for ever 1371 by the rivers of babylon there we sat down yea we wept when we remembered zion 1372 we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof 1373 for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying sing us one of the songs of zion 1374 how shall we sing the lords song in a strange land 1375 if i forget thee o jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning 1376 if i do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if i prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy 1377 remember o lord the children of edom in the day of jerusalem who said rase it rase it even to the foundation thereof 1378 o daughter of babylon who art to be destroyed happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us 1379 happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones 1381 i will praise thee with my whole heart before the gods will i sing praise unto thee 1382 i will worship toward thy holy temple and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name 1383 in the day when i cried thou answeredst me and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul 1384 all the kings of the earth shall praise thee o lord when they hear the words of thy mouth 1385 yea they shall sing in the ways of the lord for great is the glory of the lord 1386 though the lord be high yet hath he respect unto the lowly but the proud he knoweth afar off 1387 though i walk in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save me 1388 the lord will perfect that which concerneth me thy mercy o lord endureth for ever forsake not the works of thine own hands 1391 o lord thou hast searched me and known me 1392 thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising thou understandest my thought afar off 1393 thou compassest my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways 1394 for there is not a word in my tongue but lo o lord thou knowest it altogether 1395 thou hast beset me behind and before and laid thine hand upon me 1396 such knowledge is too wonderful for me it is high i cannot attain unto it 1397 whither shall i go from thy spirit or whither shall i flee from thy presence 1398 if i ascend up into heaven thou art there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there 1399 if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea 13910 even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me 13911 if i say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me 13912 yea the darkness hideth not from thee but the night shineth as the day the darkness and the light are both alike to thee 13913 for thou hast possessed my reins thou hast covered me in my mothers womb 13914 i will praise thee for i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvellous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well 13915 my substance was not hid from thee when i was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth 13916 thine eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them 13917 how precious also are thy thoughts unto me o god how great is the sum of them 13918 if i should count them they are more in number than the sand when i awake i am still with thee 13919 surely thou wilt slay the wicked o god depart from me therefore ye bloody men 13920 for they speak against thee wickedly and thine enemies take thy name in vain 13921 do not i hate them o lord that hate thee and am not i grieved with those that rise up against thee 13922 i hate them with perfect hatred i count them mine enemies 13923 search me o god and know my heart try me and know my thoughts 13924 and see if there be any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting 1401 deliver me o lord from the evil man preserve me from the violent man 1402 which imagine mischiefs in their heart continually are they gathered together for war 1403 they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent adders poison is under their lips selah 1404 keep me o lord from the hands of the wicked preserve me from the violent man who have purposed to overthrow my goings 1405 the proud have hid a snare for me and cords they have spread a net by the wayside they have set gins for me selah 1406 i said unto the lord thou art my god hear the voice of my supplications o lord 1407 o god the lord the strength of my salvation thou hast covered my head in the day of battle 1408 grant not o lord the desires of the wicked further not his wicked device lest they exalt themselves selah 1409 as for the head of those that compass me about let the mischief of their own lips cover them 14010 let burning coals fall upon them let them be cast into the fire into deep pits that they rise not up again 14011 let not an evil speaker be established in the earth evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him 14012 i know that the lord will maintain the cause of the afflicted and the right of the poor 14013 surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name the upright shall dwell in thy presence 1411 lord i cry unto thee make haste unto me give ear unto my voice when i cry unto thee 1412 let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice 1413 set a watch o lord before my mouth keep the door of my lips 1414 incline not my heart to any evil thing to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity and let me not eat of their dainties 1415 let the righteous smite me it shall be a kindness and let him reprove me it shall be an excellent oil which shall not break my head for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities 1416 when their judges are overthrown in stony places they shall hear my words for they are sweet 1417 our bones are scattered at the graves mouth as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth 1418 but mine eyes are unto thee o god the lord in thee is my trust leave not my soul destitute 1419 keep me from the snares which they have laid for me and the gins of the workers of iniquity 14110 let the wicked fall into their own nets whilst that i withal escape 1421 i cried unto the lord with my voice with my voice unto the lord did i make my supplication 1422 i poured out my complaint before him i shewed before him my trouble 1423 when my spirit was overwhelmed within me then thou knewest my path in the way wherein i walked have they privily laid a snare for me 1424 i looked on my right hand and beheld but there was no man that would know me refuge failed me no man cared for my soul 1425 i cried unto thee o lord i said thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living 1426 attend unto my cry for i am brought very low deliver me from my persecutors for they are stronger than i 1427 bring my soul out of prison that i may praise thy name the righteous shall compass me about for thou shalt deal bountifully with me 1431 hear my prayer o lord give ear to my supplications in thy faithfulness answer me and in thy righteousness 1432 and enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justified 1433 for the enemy hath persecuted my soul he hath smitten my life down to the ground he hath made me to dwell in darkness as those that have been long dead 1434 therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me my heart within me is desolate 1435 i remember the days of old i meditate on all thy works i muse on the work of thy hands 1436 i stretch forth my hands unto thee my soul thirsteth after thee as a thirsty land selah 1437 hear me speedily o lord my spirit faileth hide not thy face from me lest i be like unto them that go down into the pit 1438 cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning for in thee do i trust cause me to know the way wherein i should walk for i lift up my soul unto thee 1439 deliver me o lord from mine enemies i flee unto thee to hide me 14310 teach me to do thy will for thou art my god thy spirit is good lead me into the land of uprightness 14311 quicken me o lord for thy names sake for thy righteousness sake bring my soul out of trouble 14312 and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies and destroy all them that afflict my soul for i am thy servant 1441 blessed be the lord my strength which teacheth my hands to war and my fingers to fight 1442 my goodness and my fortress my high tower and my deliverer my shield and he in whom i trust who subdueth my people under me 1443 lord what is man that thou takest knowledge of him or the son of man that thou makest account of him 1444 man is like to vanity his days are as a shadow that passeth away 1445 bow thy heavens o lord and come down touch the mountains and they shall smoke 1446 cast forth lightning and scatter them shoot out thine arrows and destroy them 1447 send thine hand from above rid me and deliver me out of great waters from the hand of strange children 1448 whose mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood 1449 i will sing a new song unto thee o god upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will i sing praises unto thee 14410 it is he that giveth salvation unto kings who delivereth david his servant from the hurtful sword 14411 rid me and deliver me from the hand of strange children whose mouth speaketh vanity and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood 14412 that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth that our daughters may be as corner stones polished after the similitude of a palace 14413 that our garners may be full affording all manner of store that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets 14414 that our oxen may be strong to labour that there be no breaking in nor going out that there be no complaining in our streets 14415 happy is that people that is in such a case yea happy is that people whose god is the lord 1451 i will extol thee my god o king and i will bless thy name for ever and ever 1452 every day will i bless thee and i will praise thy name for ever and ever 1453 great is the lord and greatly to be praised and his greatness is unsearchable 1454 one generation shall praise thy works to another and shall declare thy mighty acts 1455 i will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty and of thy wondrous works 1456 and men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts and i will declare thy greatness 1457 they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness and shall sing of thy righteousness 1458 the lord is gracious and full of compassion slow to anger and of great mercy 1459 the lord is good to all and his tender mercies are over all his works 14510 all thy works shall praise thee o lord and thy saints shall bless thee 14511 they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power 14512 to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the glorious majesty of his kingdom 14513 thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations 14514 the lord upholdeth all that fall and raiseth up all those that be bowed down 14515 the eyes of all wait upon thee and thou givest them their meat in due season 14516 thou openest thine hand and satisfiest the desire of every living thing 14517 the lord is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works 14518 the lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him to all that call upon him in truth 14519 he will fulfil the desire of them that fear him he also will hear their cry and will save them 14520 the lord preserveth all them that love him but all the wicked will he destroy 14521 my mouth shall speak the praise of the lord and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever 1461 praise ye the lord praise the lord o my soul 1462 while i live will i praise the lord i will sing praises unto my god while i have any being 1463 put not your trust in princes nor in the son of man in whom there is no help 1464 his breath goeth forth he returneth to his earth in that very day his thoughts perish 1465 happy is he that hath the god of jacob for his help whose hope is in the lord his god 1466 which made heaven and earth the sea and all that therein is which keepeth truth for ever 1467 which executeth judgment for the oppressed which giveth food to the hungry the lord looseth the prisoners 1468 the lord openeth the eyes of the blind the lord raiseth them that are bowed down the lord loveth the righteous 1469 the lord preserveth the strangers he relieveth the fatherless and widow but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down 14610 the lord shall reign for ever even thy god o zion unto all generations praise ye the lord 1471 praise ye the lord for it is good to sing praises unto our god for it is pleasant and praise is comely 1472 the lord doth build up jerusalem he gathereth together the outcasts of israel 1473 he healeth the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds 1474 he telleth the number of the stars he calleth them all by their names 1475 great is our lord and of great power his understanding is infinite 1476 the lord lifteth up the meek he casteth the wicked down to the ground 1477 sing unto the lord with thanksgiving sing praise upon the harp unto our god 1478 who covereth the heaven with clouds who prepareth rain for the earth who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains 1479 he giveth to the beast his food and to the young ravens which cry 14710 he delighteth not in the strength of the horse he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man 14711 the lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him in those that hope in his mercy 14712 praise the lord o jerusalem praise thy god o zion 14713 for he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates he hath blessed thy children within thee 14714 he maketh peace in thy borders and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat 14715 he sendeth forth his commandment upon earth his word runneth very swiftly 14716 he giveth snow like wool he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes 14717 he casteth forth his ice like morsels who can stand before his cold 14718 he sendeth out his word and melteth them he causeth his wind to blow and the waters flow 14719 he sheweth his word unto jacob his statutes and his judgments unto israel 14720 he hath not dealt so with any nation and as for his judgments they have not known them praise ye the lord 1481 praise ye the lord praise ye the lord from the heavens praise him in the heights 1482 praise ye him all his angels praise ye him all his hosts 1483 praise ye him sun and moon praise him all ye stars of light 1484 praise him ye heavens of heavens and ye waters that be above the heavens 1485 let them praise the name of the lord for he commanded and they were created 1486 he hath also stablished them for ever and ever he hath made a decree which shall not pass 1487 praise the lord from the earth ye dragons and all deeps 1488 fire and hail snow and vapours stormy wind fulfilling his word 1489 mountains and all hills fruitful trees and all cedars 14810 beasts and all cattle creeping things and flying fowl 14811 kings of the earth and all people princes and all judges of the earth 14812 both young men and maidens old men and children 14813 let them praise the name of the lord for his name alone is excellent his glory is above the earth and heaven 14814 he also exalteth the horn of his people the praise of all his saints even of the children of israel a people near unto him praise ye the lord 1491 praise ye the lord sing unto the lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of saints 1492 let israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of zion be joyful in their king 1493 let them praise his name in the dance let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp 1494 for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation 1495 let the saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds 1496 let the high praises of god be in their mouth and a twoedged sword in their hand 1497 to execute vengeance upon the heathen and punishments upon the people 1498 to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of iron 1499 to execute upon them the judgment written this honour have all his saints praise ye the lord 1501 praise ye the lord praise god in his sanctuary praise him in the firmament of his power 1502 praise him for his mighty acts praise him according to his excellent greatness 1503 praise him with the sound of the trumpet praise him with the psaltery and harp 1504 praise him with the timbrel and dance praise him with stringed instruments and organs 1505 praise him upon the loud cymbals praise him upon the high sounding cymbals 1506 let every thing that hath breath praise the lord praise ye the lord the proverbs 11 the proverbs of solomon the son of david king of israel 12 to know wisdom and instruction to perceive the words of understanding 13 to receive the instruction of wisdom justice and judgment and equity 14 to give subtilty to the simple to the young man knowledge and discretion 15 a wise man will hear and will increase learning and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels 16 to understand a proverb and the interpretation the words of the wise and their dark sayings 17 the fear of the lord is the beginning of knowledge but fools despise wisdom and instruction 18 my son hear the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother 19 for they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head and chains about thy neck 110 my son if sinners entice thee consent thou not 111 if they say come with us let us lay wait for blood let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause 112 let us swallow them up alive as the grave and whole as those that go down into the pit 113 we shall find all precious substance we shall fill our houses with spoil 114 cast in thy lot among us let us all have one purse 115 my son walk not thou in the way with them refrain thy foot from their path 116 for their feet run to evil and make haste to shed blood 117 surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird 118 and they lay wait for their own blood they lurk privily for their own lives 119 so are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain which taketh away the life of the owners thereof 120 wisdom crieth without she uttereth her voice in the streets 121 she crieth in the chief place of concourse in the openings of the gates in the city she uttereth her words saying 122 how long ye simple ones will ye love simplicity and the scorners delight in their scorning and fools hate knowledge 123 turn you at my reproof behold i will pour out my spirit unto you i will make known my words unto you 124 because i have called and ye refused i have stretched out my hand and no man regarded 125 but ye have set at nought all my counsel and would none of my reproof 126 i also will laugh at your calamity i will mock when your fear cometh 127 when your fear cometh as desolation and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind when distress and anguish cometh upon you 128 then shall they call upon me but i will not answer they shall seek me early but they shall not find me 129 for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the lord 130 they would none of my counsel they despised all my reproof 131 therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way and be filled with their own devices 132 for the turning away of the simple shall slay them and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them 133 but whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely and shall be quiet from fear of evil 21 my son if thou wilt receive my words and hide my commandments with thee 22 so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply thine heart to understanding 23 yea if thou criest after knowledge and liftest up thy voice for understanding 24 if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hid treasures 25 then shalt thou understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god 26 for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding 27 he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly 28 he keepeth the paths of judgment and preserveth the way of his saints 29 then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity yea every good path 210 when wisdom entereth into thine heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul 211 discretion shall preserve thee understanding shall keep thee 212 to deliver thee from the way of the evil man from the man that speaketh froward things 213 who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness 214 who rejoice to do evil and delight in the frowardness of the wicked 215 whose ways are crooked and they froward in their paths 216 to deliver thee from the strange woman even from the stranger which flattereth with her words 217 which forsaketh the guide of her youth and forgetteth the covenant of her god 218 for her house inclineth unto death and her paths unto the dead 219 none that go unto her return again neither take they hold of the paths of life 220 that thou mayest walk in the way of good men and keep the paths of the righteous 221 for the upright shall dwell in the land and the perfect shall remain in it 222 but the wicked shall be cut off from the earth and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it 31 my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my commandments 32 for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee 33 let not mercy and truth forsake thee bind them about thy neck write them upon the table of thine heart 34 so shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of god and man 35 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding 36 in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths 37 be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil 38 it shall be health to thy navel and marrow to thy bones 39 honour the lord with thy substance and with the firstfruits of all thine increase 310 so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine 311 my son despise not the chastening of the lord neither be weary of his correction 312 for whom the lord loveth he correcteth even as a father the son in whom he delighteth 313 happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that getteth understanding 314 for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and the gain thereof than fine gold 315 she is more precious than rubies and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her 316 length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honour 317 her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace 318 she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy is every one that retaineth her 319 the lord by wisdom hath founded the earth by understanding hath he established the heavens 320 by his knowledge the depths are broken up and the clouds drop down the dew 321 my son let not them depart from thine eyes keep sound wisdom and discretion 322 so shall they be life unto thy soul and grace to thy neck 323 then shalt thou walk in thy way safely and thy foot shall not stumble 324 when thou liest down thou shalt not be afraid yea thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet 325 be not afraid of sudden fear neither of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh 326 for the lord shall be thy confidence and shall keep thy foot from being taken 327 withhold not good from them to whom it is due when it is in the power of thine hand to do it 328 say not unto thy neighbour go and come again and to morrow i will give when thou hast it by thee 329 devise not evil against thy neighbour seeing he dwelleth securely by thee 330 strive not with a man without cause if he have done thee no harm 331 envy thou not the oppressor and choose none of his ways 332 for the froward is abomination to the lord but his secret is with the righteous 333 the curse of the lord is in the house of the wicked but he blesseth the habitation of the just 334 surely he scorneth the scorners but he giveth grace unto the lowly 335 the wise shall inherit glory but shame shall be the promotion of fools 41 hear ye children the instruction of a father and attend to know understanding 42 for i give you good doctrine forsake ye not my law 43 for i was my fathers son tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother 44 he taught me also and said unto me let thine heart retain my words keep my commandments and live 45 get wisdom get understanding forget it not neither decline from the words of my mouth 46 forsake her not and she shall preserve thee love her and she shall keep thee 47 wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding 48 exalt her and she shall promote thee she shall bring thee to honour when thou dost embrace her 49 she shall give to thine head an ornament of grace a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee 410 hear o my son and receive my sayings and the years of thy life shall be many 411 i have taught thee in the way of wisdom i have led thee in right paths 412 when thou goest thy steps shall not be straitened and when thou runnest thou shalt not stumble 413 take fast hold of instruction let her not go keep her for she is thy life 414 enter not into the path of the wicked and go not in the way of evil men 415 avoid it pass not by it turn from it and pass away 416 for they sleep not except they have done mischief and their sleep is taken away unless they cause some to fall 417 for they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence 418 but the path of the just is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day 419 the way of the wicked is as darkness they know not at what they stumble 420 my son attend to my words incline thine ear unto my sayings 421 let them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart 422 for they are life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh 423 keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life 424 put away from thee a froward mouth and perverse lips put far from thee 425 let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee 426 ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established 427 turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from evil 51 my son attend unto my wisdom and bow thine ear to my understanding 52 that thou mayest regard discretion and that thy lips may keep knowledge 53 for the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb and her mouth is smoother than oil 54 but her end is bitter as wormwood sharp as a twoedged sword 55 her feet go down to death her steps take hold on hell 56 lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life her ways are moveable that thou canst not know them 57 hear me now therefore o ye children and depart not from the words of my mouth 58 remove thy way far from her and come not nigh the door of her house 59 lest thou give thine honour unto others and thy years unto the cruel 510 lest strangers be filled with thy wealth and thy labours be in the house of a stranger 511 and thou mourn at the last when thy flesh and thy body are consumed 512 and say how have i hated instruction and my heart despised reproof 513 and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me 514 i was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly 515 drink waters out of thine own cistern and running waters out of thine own well 516 let thy fountains be dispersed abroad and rivers of waters in the streets 517 let them be only thine own and not strangers with thee 518 let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth 519 let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe let her breasts satisfy thee at all times and be thou ravished always with her love 520 and why wilt thou my son be ravished with a strange woman and embrace the bosom of a stranger 521 for the ways of man are before the eyes of the lord and he pondereth all his goings 522 his own iniquities shall take the wicked himself and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins 523 he shall die without instruction and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray 61 my son if thou be surety for thy friend if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger 62 thou art snared with the words of thy mouth thou art taken with the words of thy mouth 63 do this now my son and deliver thyself when thou art come into the hand of thy friend go humble thyself and make sure thy friend 64 give not sleep to thine eyes nor slumber to thine eyelids 65 deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter and as a bird from the hand of the fowler 66 go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise 67 which having no guide overseer or ruler 68 provideth her meat in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest 69 how long wilt thou sleep o sluggard when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep 610 yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep 611 so shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth and thy want as an armed man 612 a naughty person a wicked man walketh with a froward mouth 613 he winketh with his eyes he speaketh with his feet he teacheth with his fingers 614 frowardness is in his heart he deviseth mischief continually he soweth discord 615 therefore shall his calamity come suddenly suddenly shall he be broken without remedy 616 these six things doth the lord hate yea seven are an abomination unto him 617 a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood 618 an heart that deviseth wicked imaginations feet that be swift in running to mischief 619 a false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among brethren 620 my son keep thy fathers commandment and forsake not the law of thy mother 621 bind them continually upon thine heart and tie them about thy neck 622 when thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall keep thee and when thou awakest it shall talk with thee 623 for the commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life 624 to keep thee from the evil woman from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman 625 lust not after her beauty in thine heart neither let her take thee with her eyelids 626 for by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread and the adultress will hunt for the precious life 627 can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned 628 can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned 629 so he that goeth in to his neighbours wife whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent 630 men do not despise a thief if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry 631 but if he be found he shall restore sevenfold he shall give all the substance of his house 632 but whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul 633 a wound and dishonour shall he get and his reproach shall not be wiped away 634 for jealousy is the rage of a man therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance 635 he will not regard any ransom neither will he rest content though thou givest many gifts 71 my son keep my words and lay up my commandments with thee 72 keep my commandments and live and my law as the apple of thine eye 73 bind them upon thy fingers write them upon the table of thine heart 74 say unto wisdom thou art my sister and call understanding thy kinswoman 75 that they may keep thee from the strange woman from the stranger which flattereth with her words 76 for at the window of my house i looked through my casement 77 and beheld among the simple ones i discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding 78 passing through the street near her corner and he went the way to her house 79 in the twilight in the evening in the black and dark night 710 and behold there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot and subtil of heart 711 she is loud and stubborn her feet abide not in her house 712 now is she without now in the streets and lieth in wait at every corner 713 so she caught him and kissed him and with an impudent face said unto him 714 i have peace offerings with me this day have i payed my vows 715 therefore came i forth to meet thee diligently to seek thy face and i have found thee 716 i have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry with carved works with fine linen of egypt 717 i have perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon 718 come let us take our fill of love until the morning let us solace ourselves with loves 719 for the goodman is not at home he is gone a long journey 720 he hath taken a bag of money with him and will come home at the day appointed 721 with her much fair speech she caused him to yield with the flattering of her lips she forced him 722 he goeth after her straightway as an ox goeth to the slaughter or as a fool to the correction of the stocks 723 till a dart strike through his liver as a bird hasteth to the snare and knoweth not that it is for his life 724 hearken unto me now therefore o ye children and attend to the words of my mouth 725 let not thine heart decline to her ways go not astray in her paths 726 for she hath cast down many wounded yea many strong men have been slain by her 727 her house is the way to hell going down to the chambers of death 81 doth not wisdom cry and understanding put forth her voice 82 she standeth in the top of high places by the way in the places of the paths 83 she crieth at the gates at the entry of the city at the coming in at the doors 84 unto you o men i call and my voice is to the sons of man 85 o ye simple understand wisdom and ye fools be ye of an understanding heart 86 hear for i will speak of excellent things and the opening of my lips shall be right things 87 for my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an abomination to my lips 88 all the words of my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing froward or perverse in them 89 they are all plain to him that understandeth and right to them that find knowledge 810 receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge rather than choice gold 811 for wisdom is better than rubies and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it 812 i wisdom dwell with prudence and find out knowledge of witty inventions 813 the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the froward mouth do i hate 814 counsel is mine and sound wisdom i am understanding i have strength 815 by me kings reign and princes decree justice 816 by me princes rule and nobles even all the judges of the earth 817 i love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me 818 riches and honour are with me yea durable riches and righteousness 819 my fruit is better than gold yea than fine gold and my revenue than choice silver 820 i lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of judgment 821 that i may cause those that love me to inherit substance and i will fill their treasures 822 the lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old 823 i was set up from everlasting from the beginning or ever the earth was 824 when there were no depths i was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water 825 before the mountains were settled before the hills was i brought forth 826 while as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the dust of the world 827 when he prepared the heavens i was there when he set a compass upon the face of the depth 828 when he established the clouds above when he strengthened the fountains of the deep 829 when he gave to the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth 830 then i was by him as one brought up with him and i was daily his delight rejoicing always before him 831 rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth and my delights were with the sons of men 832 now therefore hearken unto me o ye children for blessed are they that keep my ways 833 hear instruction and be wise and refuse it not 834 blessed is the man that heareth me watching daily at my gates waiting at the posts of my doors 835 for whoso findeth me findeth life and shall obtain favour of the lord 836 but he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul all they that hate me love death 91 wisdom hath builded her house she hath hewn out her seven pillars 92 she hath killed her beasts she hath mingled her wine she hath also furnished her table 93 she hath sent forth her maidens she crieth upon the highest places of the city 94 whoso is simple let him turn in hither as for him that wanteth understanding she saith to him 95 come eat of my bread and drink of the wine which i have mingled 96 forsake the foolish and live and go in the way of understanding 97 he that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot 98 reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man and he will love thee 99 give instruction to a wise man and he will be yet wiser teach a just man and he will increase in learning 910 the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the holy is understanding 911 for by me thy days shall be multiplied and the years of thy life shall be increased 912 if thou be wise thou shalt be wise for thyself but if thou scornest thou alone shalt bear it 913 a foolish woman is clamorous she is simple and knoweth nothing 914 for she sitteth at the door of her house on a seat in the high places of the city 915 to call passengers who go right on their ways 916 whoso is simple let him turn in hither and as for him that wanteth understanding she saith to him 917 stolen waters are sweet and bread eaten in secret is pleasant 918 but he knoweth not that the dead are there and that her guests are in the depths of hell 101 the proverbs of solomon a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother 102 treasures of wickedness profit nothing but righteousness delivereth from death 103 the lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish but he casteth away the substance of the wicked 104 he becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh rich 105 he that gathereth in summer is a wise son but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame 106 blessings are upon the head of the just but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked 107 the memory of the just is blessed but the name of the wicked shall rot 108 the wise in heart will receive commandments but a prating fool shall fall 109 he that walketh uprightly walketh surely but he that perverteth his ways shall be known 1010 he that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow but a prating fool shall fall 1011 the mouth of a righteous man is a well of life but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked 1012 hatred stirreth up strifes but love covereth all sins 1013 in the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding 1014 wise men lay up knowledge but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction 1015 the rich mans wealth is his strong city the destruction of the poor is their poverty 1016 the labour of the righteous tendeth to life the fruit of the wicked to sin 1017 he is in the way of life that keepeth instruction but he that refuseth reproof erreth 1018 he that hideth hatred with lying lips and he that uttereth a slander is a fool 1019 in the multitude of words there wanteth not sin but he that refraineth his lips is wise 1020 the tongue of the just is as choice silver the heart of the wicked is little worth 1021 the lips of the righteous feed many but fools die for want of wisdom 1022 the blessing of the lord it maketh rich and he addeth no sorrow with it 1023 it is as sport to a fool to do mischief but a man of understanding hath wisdom 1024 the fear of the wicked it shall come upon him but the desire of the righteous shall be granted 1025 as the whirlwind passeth so is the wicked no more but the righteous is an everlasting foundation 1026 as vinegar to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes so is the sluggard to them that send him 1027 the fear of the lord prolongeth days but the years of the wicked shall be shortened 1028 the hope of the righteous shall be gladness but the expectation of the wicked shall perish 1029 the way of the lord is strength to the upright but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity 1030 the righteous shall never be removed but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth 1031 the mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom but the froward tongue shall be cut out 1032 the lips of the righteous know what is acceptable but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness 111 a false balance is abomination to the lord but a just weight is his delight 112 when pride cometh then cometh shame but with the lowly is wisdom 113 the integrity of the upright shall guide them but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them 114 riches profit not in the day of wrath but righteousness delivereth from death 115 the righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness 116 the righteousness of the upright shall deliver them but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness 117 when a wicked man dieth his expectation shall perish and the hope of unjust men perisheth 118 the righteous is delivered out of trouble and the wicked cometh in his stead 119 an hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour but through knowledge shall the just be delivered 1110 when it goeth well with the righteous the city rejoiceth and when the wicked perish there is shouting 1111 by the blessing of the upright the city is exalted but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked 1112 he that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour but a man of understanding holdeth his peace 1113 a talebearer revealeth secrets but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter 1114 where no counsel is the people fall but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety 1115 he that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it and he that hateth suretiship is sure 1116 a gracious woman retaineth honour and strong men retain riches 1117 the merciful man doeth good to his own soul but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh 1118 the wicked worketh a deceitful work but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward 1119 as righteousness tendeth to life so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death 1120 they that are of a froward heart are abomination to the lord but such as are upright in their way are his delight 1121 though hand join in hand the wicked shall not be unpunished but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered 1122 as a jewel of gold in a swines snout so is a fair woman which is without discretion 1123 the desire of the righteous is only good but the expectation of the wicked is wrath 1124 there is that scattereth and yet increaseth and there is that withholdeth more than is meet but it tendeth to poverty 1125 the liberal soul shall be made fat and he that watereth shall be watered also himself 1126 he that withholdeth corn the people shall curse him but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it 1127 he that diligently seeketh good procureth favour but he that seeketh mischief it shall come unto him 1128 he that trusteth in his riches shall fall but the righteous shall flourish as a branch 1129 he that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart 1130 the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he that winneth souls is wise 1131 behold the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth much more the wicked and the sinner 121 whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge but he that hateth reproof is brutish 122 a good man obtaineth favour of the lord but a man of wicked devices will he condemn 123 a man shall not be established by wickedness but the root of the righteous shall not be moved 124 a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones 125 the thoughts of the righteous are right but the counsels of the wicked are deceit 126 the words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them 127 the wicked are overthrown and are not but the house of the righteous shall stand 128 a man shall be commended according to his wisdom but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised 129 he that is despised and hath a servant is better than he that honoureth himself and lacketh bread 1210 a righteous man regardeth the life of his beast but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel 1211 he that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding 1212 the wicked desireth the net of evil men but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit 1213 the wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips but the just shall come out of trouble 1214 a man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth and the recompence of a mans hands shall be rendered unto him 1215 the way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise 1216 a fools wrath is presently known but a prudent man covereth shame 1217 he that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness but a false witness deceit 1218 there is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword but the tongue of the wise is health 1219 the lip of truth shall be established for ever but a lying tongue is but for a moment 1220 deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil but to the counsellors of peace is joy 1221 there shall no evil happen to the just but the wicked shall be filled with mischief 1222 lying lips are abomination to the lord but they that deal truly are his delight 1223 a prudent man concealeth knowledge but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness 1224 the hand of the diligent shall bear rule but the slothful shall be under tribute 1225 heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop but a good word maketh it glad 1226 the righteous is more excellent than his neighbour but the way of the wicked seduceth them 1227 the slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting but the substance of a diligent man is precious 1228 in the way of righteousness is life and in the pathway thereof there is no death 131 a wise son heareth his fathers instruction but a scorner heareth not rebuke 132 a man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence 133 he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction 134 the soul of the sluggard desireth and hath nothing but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat 135 a righteous man hateth lying but a wicked man is loathsome and cometh to shame 136 righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way but wickedness overthroweth the sinner 137 there is that maketh himself rich yet hath nothing there is that maketh himself poor yet hath great riches 138 the ransom of a mans life are his riches but the poor heareth not rebuke 139 the light of the righteous rejoiceth but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out 1310 only by pride cometh contention but with the well advised is wisdom 1311 wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished but he that gathereth by labour shall increase 1312 hope deferred maketh the heart sick but when the desire cometh it is a tree of life 1313 whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded 1314 the law of the wise is a fountain of life to depart from the snares of death 1315 good understanding giveth favour but the way of transgressors is hard 1316 every prudent man dealeth with knowledge but a fool layeth open his folly 1317 a wicked messenger falleth into mischief but a faithful ambassador is health 1318 poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured 1319 the desire accomplished is sweet to the soul but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil 1320 he that walketh with wise men shall be wise but a companion of fools shall be destroyed 1321 evil pursueth sinners but to the righteous good shall be repayed 1322 a good man leaveth an inheritance to his childrens children and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just 1323 much food is in the tillage of the poor but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment 1324 he that spareth his rod hateth his son but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes 1325 the righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul but the belly of the wicked shall want 141 every wise woman buildeth her house but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands 142 he that walketh in his uprightness feareth the lord but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him 143 in the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride but the lips of the wise shall preserve them 144 where no oxen are the crib is clean but much increase is by the strength of the ox 145 a faithful witness will not lie but a false witness will utter lies 146 a scorner seeketh wisdom and findeth it not but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth 147 go from the presence of a foolish man when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge 148 the wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way but the folly of fools is deceit 149 fools make a mock at sin but among the righteous there is favour 1410 the heart knoweth his own bitterness and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy 1411 the house of the wicked shall be overthrown but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish 1412 there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death 1413 even in laughter the heart is sorrowful and the end of that mirth is heaviness 1414 the backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways and a good man shall be satisfied from himself 1415 the simple believeth every word but the prudent man looketh well to his going 1416 a wise man feareth and departeth from evil but the fool rageth and is confident 1417 he that is soon angry dealeth foolishly and a man of wicked devices is hated 1418 the simple inherit folly but the prudent are crowned with knowledge 1419 the evil bow before the good and the wicked at the gates of the righteous 1420 the poor is hated even of his own neighbour but the rich hath many friends 1421 he that despiseth his neighbour sinneth but he that hath mercy on the poor happy is he 1422 do they not err that devise evil but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good 1423 in all labour there is profit but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury 1424 the crown of the wise is their riches but the foolishness of fools is folly 1425 a true witness delivereth souls but a deceitful witness speaketh lies 1426 in the fear of the lord is strong confidence and his children shall have a place of refuge 1427 the fear of the lord is a fountain of life to depart from the snares of death 1428 in the multitude of people is the kings honour but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince 1429 he that is slow to wrath is of great understanding but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly 1430 a sound heart is the life of the flesh but envy the rottenness of the bones 1431 he that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his maker but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor 1432 the wicked is driven away in his wickedness but the righteous hath hope in his death 1433 wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding but that which is in the midst of fools is made known 1434 righteousness exalteth a nation but sin is a reproach to any people 1435 the kings favour is toward a wise servant but his wrath is against him that causeth shame 151 a soft answer turneth away wrath but grievous words stir up anger 152 the tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness 153 the eyes of the lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good 154 a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit 155 a fool despiseth his fathers instruction but he that regardeth reproof is prudent 156 in the house of the righteous is much treasure but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble 157 the lips of the wise disperse knowledge but the heart of the foolish doeth not so 158 the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the lord but the prayer of the upright is his delight 159 the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness 1510 correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way and he that hateth reproof shall die 1511 hell and destruction are before the lord how much more then the hearts of the children of men 1512 a scorner loveth not one that reproveth him neither will he go unto the wise 1513 a merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken 1514 the heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness 1515 all the days of the afflicted are evil but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast 1516 better is little with the fear of the lord than great treasure and trouble therewith 1517 better is a dinner of herbs where love is than a stalled ox and hatred therewith 1518 a wrathful man stirreth up strife but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife 1519 the way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns but the way of the righteous is made plain 1520 a wise son maketh a glad father but a foolish man despiseth his mother 1521 folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom but a man of understanding walketh uprightly 1522 without counsel purposes are disappointed but in the multitude of counsellors they are established 1523 a man hath joy by the answer of his mouth and a word spoken in due season how good is it 1524 the way of life is above to the wise that he may depart from hell beneath 1525 the lord will destroy the house of the proud but he will establish the border of the widow 1526 the thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the lord but the words of the pure are pleasant words 1527 he that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house but he that hateth gifts shall live 1528 the heart of the righteous studieth to answer but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things 1529 the lord is far from the wicked but he heareth the prayer of the righteous 1530 the light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart and a good report maketh the bones fat 1531 the ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise 1532 he that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding 1533 the fear of the lord is the instruction of wisdom and before honour is humility 161 the preparations of the heart in man and the answer of the tongue is from the lord 162 all the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes but the lord weigheth the spirits 163 commit thy works unto the lord and thy thoughts shall be established 164 the lord hath made all things for himself yea even the wicked for the day of evil 165 every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the lord though hand join in hand he shall not be unpunished 166 by mercy and truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the lord men depart from evil 167 when a mans ways please the lord he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him 168 better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right 169 a mans heart deviseth his way but the lord directeth his steps 1610 a divine sentence is in the lips of the king his mouth transgresseth not in judgment 1611 a just weight and balance are the lords all the weights of the bag are his work 1612 it is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness for the throne is established by righteousness 1613 righteous lips are the delight of kings and they love him that speaketh right 1614 the wrath of a king is as messengers of death but a wise man will pacify it 1615 in the light of the kings countenance is life and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain 1616 how much better is it to get wisdom than gold and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver 1617 the highway of the upright is to depart from evil he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul 1618 pride goeth before destruction and an haughty spirit before a fall 1619 better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly than to divide the spoil with the proud 1620 he that handleth a matter wisely shall find good and whoso trusteth in the lord happy is he 1621 the wise in heart shall be called prudent and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning 1622 understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it but the instruction of fools is folly 1623 the heart of the wise teacheth his mouth and addeth learning to his lips 1624 pleasant words are as an honeycomb sweet to the soul and health to the bones 1625 there is a way that seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death 1626 he that laboureth laboureth for himself for his mouth craveth it of him 1627 an ungodly man diggeth up evil and in his lips there is as a burning fire 1628 a froward man soweth strife and a whisperer separateth chief friends 1629 a violent man enticeth his neighbour and leadeth him into the way that is not good 1630 he shutteth his eyes to devise froward things moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass 1631 the hoary head is a crown of glory if it be found in the way of righteousness 1632 he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city 1633 the lot is cast into the lap but the whole disposing thereof is of the lord 171 better is a dry morsel and quietness therewith than an house full of sacrifices with strife 172 a wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren 173 the fining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold but the lord trieth the hearts 174 a wicked doer giveth heed to false lips and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue 175 whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his maker and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished 176 childrens children are the crown of old men and the glory of children are their fathers 177 excellent speech becometh not a fool much less do lying lips a prince 178 a gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it whithersoever it turneth it prospereth 179 he that covereth a transgression seeketh love but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends 1710 a reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool 1711 an evil man seeketh only rebellion therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him 1712 let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man rather than a fool in his folly 1713 whoso rewardeth evil for good evil shall not depart from his house 1714 the beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water therefore leave off contention before it be meddled with 1715 he that justifieth the wicked and he that condemneth the just even they both are abomination to the lord 1716 wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom seeing he hath no heart to it 1717 a friend loveth at all times and a brother is born for adversity 1718 a man void of understanding striketh hands and becometh surety in the presence of his friend 1719 he loveth transgression that loveth strife and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction 1720 he that hath a froward heart findeth no good and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief 1721 he that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow and the father of a fool hath no joy 1722 a merry heart doeth good like a medicine but a broken spirit drieth the bones 1723 a wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment 1724 wisdom is before him that hath understanding but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth 1725 a foolish son is a grief to his father and bitterness to her that bare him 1726 also to punish the just is not good nor to strike princes for equity 1727 he that hath knowledge spareth his words and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit 1728 even a fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wise and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding 181 through desire a man having separated himself seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom 182 a fool hath no delight in understanding but that his heart may discover itself 183 when the wicked cometh then cometh also contempt and with ignominy reproach 184 the words of a mans mouth are as deep waters and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook 185 it is not good to accept the person of the wicked to overthrow the righteous in judgment 186 a fools lips enter into contention and his mouth calleth for strokes 187 a fools mouth is his destruction and his lips are the snare of his soul 188 the words of a talebearer are as wounds and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly 189 he also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster 1810 the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous runneth into it and is safe 1811 the rich mans wealth is his strong city and as an high wall in his own conceit 1812 before destruction the heart of man is haughty and before honour is humility 1813 he that answereth a matter before he heareth it it is folly and shame unto him 1814 the spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity but a wounded spirit who can bear 1815 the heart of the prudent getteth knowledge and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge 1816 a mans gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before great men 1817 he that is first in his own cause seemeth just but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him 1818 the lot causeth contentions to cease and parteth between the mighty 1819 a brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city and their contentions are like the bars of a castle 1820 a mans belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled 1821 death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof 1822 whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favour of the lord 1823 the poor useth intreaties but the rich answereth roughly 1824 a man that hath friends must shew himself friendly and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother 191 better is the poor that walketh in his integrity than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool 192 also that the soul be without knowledge it is not good and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth 193 the foolishness of man perverteth his way and his heart fretteth against the lord 194 wealth maketh many friends but the poor is separated from his neighbour 195 a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh lies shall not escape 196 many will intreat the favour of the prince and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts 197 all the brethren of the poor do hate him how much more do his friends go far from him he pursueth them with words yet they are wanting to him 198 he that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul he that keepeth understanding shall find good 199 a false witness shall not be unpunished and he that speaketh lies shall perish 1910 delight is not seemly for a fool much less for a servant to have rule over princes 1911 the discretion of a man deferreth his anger and it is his glory to pass over a transgression 1912 the kings wrath is as the roaring of a lion but his favour is as dew upon the grass 1913 a foolish son is the calamity of his father and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping 1914 house and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a prudent wife is from the lord 1915 slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep and an idle soul shall suffer hunger 1916 he that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul but he that despiseth his ways shall die 1917 he that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the lord and that which he hath given will he pay him again 1918 chasten thy son while there is hope and let not thy soul spare for his crying 1919 a man of great wrath shall suffer punishment for if thou deliver him yet thou must do it again 1920 hear counsel and receive instruction that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end 1921 there are many devices in a mans heart nevertheless the counsel of the lord that shall stand 1922 the desire of a man is his kindness and a poor man is better than a liar 1923 the fear of the lord tendeth to life and he that hath it shall abide satisfied he shall not be visited with evil 1924 a slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again 1925 smite a scorner and the simple will beware and reprove one that hath understanding and he will understand knowledge 1926 he that wasteth his father and chaseth away his mother is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach 1927 cease my son to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge 1928 an ungodly witness scorneth judgment and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity 1929 judgments are prepared for scorners and stripes for the back of fools 201 wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise 202 the fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul 203 it is an honour for a man to cease from strife but every fool will be meddling 204 the sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold therefore shall he beg in harvest and have nothing 205 counsel in the heart of man is like deep water but a man of understanding will draw it out 206 most men will proclaim every one his own goodness but a faithful man who can find 207 the just man walketh in his integrity his children are blessed after him 208 a king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes 209 who can say i have made my heart clean i am pure from my sin 2010 divers weights and divers measures both of them are alike abomination to the lord 2011 even a child is known by his doings whether his work be pure and whether it be right 2012 the hearing ear and the seeing eye the lord hath made even both of them 2013 love not sleep lest thou come to poverty open thine eyes and thou shalt be satisfied with bread 2014 it is naught it is naught saith the buyer but when he is gone his way then he boasteth 2015 there is gold and a multitude of rubies but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel 2016 take his garment that is surety for a stranger and take a pledge of him for a strange woman 2017 bread of deceit is sweet to a man but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel 2018 every purpose is established by counsel and with good advice make war 2019 he that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips 2020 whoso curseth his father or his mother his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness 2021 an inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning but the end thereof shall not be blessed 2022 say not thou i will recompense evil but wait on the lord and he shall save thee 2023 divers weights are an abomination unto the lord and a false balance is not good 2024 mans goings are of the lord how can a man then understand his own way 2025 it is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy and after vows to make enquiry 2026 a wise king scattereth the wicked and bringeth the wheel over them 2027 the spirit of man is the candle of the lord searching all the inward parts of the belly 2028 mercy and truth preserve the king and his throne is upholden by mercy 2029 the glory of young men is their strength and the beauty of old men is the grey head 2030 the blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil so do stripes the inward parts of the belly 211 the kings heart is in the hand of the lord as the rivers of water he turneth it whithersoever he will 212 every way of a man is right in his own eyes but the lord pondereth the hearts 213 to do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the lord than sacrifice 214 an high look and a proud heart and the plowing of the wicked is sin 215 the thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness but of every one that is hasty only to want 216 the getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death 217 the robbery of the wicked shall destroy them because they refuse to do judgment 218 the way of man is froward and strange but as for the pure his work is right 219 it is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house 2110 the soul of the wicked desireth evil his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes 2111 when the scorner is punished the simple is made wise and when the wise is instructed he receiveth knowledge 2112 the righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked but god overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness 2113 whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor he also shall cry himself but shall not be heard 2114 a gift in secret pacifieth anger and a reward in the bosom strong wrath 2115 it is joy to the just to do judgment but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity 2116 the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead 2117 he that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich 2118 the wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous and the transgressor for the upright 2119 it is better to dwell in the wilderness than with a contentious and an angry woman 2120 there is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise but a foolish man spendeth it up 2121 he that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life righteousness and honour 2122 a wise man scaleth the city of the mighty and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof 2123 whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles 2124 proud and haughty scorner is his name who dealeth in proud wrath 2125 the desire of the slothful killeth him for his hands refuse to labour 2126 he coveteth greedily all the day long but the righteous giveth and spareth not 2127 the sacrifice of the wicked is abomination how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked mind 2128 a false witness shall perish but the man that heareth speaketh constantly 2129 a wicked man hardeneth his face but as for the upright he directeth his way 2130 there is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the lord 2131 the horse is prepared against the day of battle but safety is of the lord 221 a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches and loving favour rather than silver and gold 222 the rich and poor meet together the lord is the maker of them all 223 a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are punished 224 by humility and the fear of the lord are riches and honour and life 225 thorns and snares are in the way of the froward he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them 226 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it 227 the rich ruleth over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender 228 he that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity and the rod of his anger shall fail 229 he that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed for he giveth of his bread to the poor 2210 cast out the scorner and contention shall go out yea strife and reproach shall cease 2211 he that loveth pureness of heart for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend 2212 the eyes of the lord preserve knowledge and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor 2213 the slothful man saith there is a lion without i shall be slain in the streets 2214 the mouth of strange women is a deep pit he that is abhorred of the lord shall fall therein 2215 foolishness is bound in the heart of a child but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him 2216 he that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches and he that giveth to the rich shall surely come to want 2217 bow down thine ear and hear the words of the wise and apply thine heart unto my knowledge 2218 for it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee they shall withal be fitted in thy lips 2219 that thy trust may be in the lord i have made known to thee this day even to thee 2220 have not i written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge 2221 that i might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee 2222 rob not the poor because he is poor neither oppress the afflicted in the gate 2223 for the lord will plead their cause and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them 2224 make no friendship with an angry man and with a furious man thou shalt not go 2225 lest thou learn his ways and get a snare to thy soul 2226 be not thou one of them that strike hands or of them that are sureties for debts 2227 if thou hast nothing to pay why should he take away thy bed from under thee 2228 remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set 2229 seest thou a man diligent in his business he shall stand before kings he shall not stand before mean men 231 when thou sittest to eat with a ruler consider diligently what is before thee 232 and put a knife to thy throat if thou be a man given to appetite 233 be not desirous of his dainties for they are deceitful meat 234 labour not to be rich cease from thine own wisdom 235 wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not for riches certainly make themselves wings they fly away as an eagle toward heaven 236 eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye neither desire thou his dainty meats 237 for as he thinketh in his heart so is he eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee 238 the morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up and lose thy sweet words 239 speak not in the ears of a fool for he will despise the wisdom of thy words 2310 remove not the old landmark and enter not into the fields of the fatherless 2311 for their redeemer is mighty he shall plead their cause with thee 2312 apply thine heart unto instruction and thine ears to the words of knowledge 2313 withhold not correction from the child for if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die 2314 thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul from hell 2315 my son if thine heart be wise my heart shall rejoice even mine 2316 yea my reins shall rejoice when thy lips speak right things 2317 let not thine heart envy sinners but be thou in the fear of the lord all the day long 2318 for surely there is an end and thine expectation shall not be cut off 2319 hear thou my son and be wise and guide thine heart in the way 2320 be not among winebibbers among riotous eaters of flesh 2321 for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags 2322 hearken unto thy father that begat thee and despise not thy mother when she is old 2323 buy the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruction and understanding 2324 the father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him 2325 thy father and thy mother shall be glad and she that bare thee shall rejoice 2326 my son give me thine heart and let thine eyes observe my ways 2327 for a whore is a deep ditch and a strange woman is a narrow pit 2328 she also lieth in wait as for a prey and increaseth the transgressors among men 2329 who hath woe who hath sorrow who hath contentions who hath babbling who hath wounds without cause who hath redness of eyes 2330 they that tarry long at the wine they that go to seek mixed wine 2331 look not thou upon the wine when it is red when it giveth his colour in the cup when it moveth itself aright 2332 at the last it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder 2333 thine eyes shall behold strange women and thine heart shall utter perverse things 2334 yea thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast 2335 they have stricken me shalt thou say and i was not sick they have beaten me and i felt it not when shall i awake i will seek it yet again 241 be not thou envious against evil men neither desire to be with them 242 for their heart studieth destruction and their lips talk of mischief 243 through wisdom is an house builded and by understanding it is established 244 and by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches 245 a wise man is strong yea a man of knowledge increaseth strength 246 for by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war and in multitude of counsellors there is safety 247 wisdom is too high for a fool he openeth not his mouth in the gate 248 he that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous person 249 the thought of foolishness is sin and the scorner is an abomination to men 2410 if thou faint in the day of adversity thy strength is small 2411 if thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death and those that are ready to be slain 2412 if thou sayest behold we knew it not doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it and he that keepeth thy soul doth not he know it and shall not he render to every man according to his works 2413 my son eat thou honey because it is good and the honeycomb which is sweet to thy taste 2414 so shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul when thou hast found it then there shall be a reward and thy expectation shall not be cut off 2415 lay not wait o wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous spoil not his resting place 2416 for a just man falleth seven times and riseth up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief 2417 rejoice not when thine enemy falleth and let not thine heart be glad when he stumbleth 2418 lest the lord see it and it displease him and he turn away his wrath from him 2419 fret not thyself because of evil men neither be thou envious at the wicked 2420 for there shall be no reward to the evil man the candle of the wicked shall be put out 2421 my son fear thou the lord and the king and meddle not with them that are given to change 2422 for their calamity shall rise suddenly and who knoweth the ruin of them both 2423 these things also belong to the wise it is not good to have respect of persons in judgment 2424 he that saith unto the wicked thou are righteous him shall the people curse nations shall abhor him 2425 but to them that rebuke him shall be delight and a good blessing shall come upon them 2426 every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer 2427 prepare thy work without and make it fit for thyself in the field and afterwards build thine house 2428 be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause and deceive not with thy lips 2429 say not i will do so to him as he hath done to me i will render to the man according to his work 2430 i went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding 2431 and lo it was all grown over with thorns and nettles had covered the face thereof and the stone wall thereof was broken down 2432 then i saw and considered it well i looked upon it and received instruction 2433 yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep 2434 so shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth and thy want as an armed man 251 these are also proverbs of solomon which the men of hezekiah king of judah copied out 252 it is the glory of god to conceal a thing but the honour of kings is to search out a matter 253 the heaven for height and the earth for depth and the heart of kings is unsearchable 254 take away the dross from the silver and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer 255 take away the wicked from before the king and his throne shall be established in righteousness 256 put not forth thyself in the presence of the king and stand not in the place of great men 257 for better it is that it be said unto thee come up hither than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen 258 go not forth hastily to strive lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame 259 debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself and discover not a secret to another 2510 lest he that heareth it put thee to shame and thine infamy turn not away 2511 a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver 2512 as an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear 2513 as the cold of snow in the time of harvest so is a faithful messenger to them that send him for he refresheth the soul of his masters 2514 whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain 2515 by long forbearing is a prince persuaded and a soft tongue breaketh the bone 2516 hast thou found honey eat so much as is sufficient for thee lest thou be filled therewith and vomit it 2517 withdraw thy foot from thy neighbours house lest he be weary of thee and so hate thee 2518 a man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul and a sword and a sharp arrow 2519 confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth and a foot out of joint 2520 as he that taketh away a garment in cold weather and as vinegar upon nitre so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart 2521 if thine enemy be hungry give him bread to eat and if he be thirsty give him water to drink 2522 for thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head and the lord shall reward thee 2523 the north wind driveth away rain so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue 2524 it is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman and in a wide house 2525 as cold waters to a thirsty soul so is good news from a far country 2526 a righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain and a corrupt spring 2527 it is not good to eat much honey so for men to search their own glory is not glory 2528 he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and without walls 261 as snow in summer and as rain in harvest so honour is not seemly for a fool 262 as the bird by wandering as the swallow by flying so the curse causeless shall not come 263 a whip for the horse a bridle for the ass and a rod for the fools back 264 answer not a fool according to his folly lest thou also be like unto him 265 answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own conceit 266 he that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet and drinketh damage 267 the legs of the lame are not equal so is a parable in the mouth of fools 268 as he that bindeth a stone in a sling so is he that giveth honour to a fool 269 as a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard so is a parable in the mouths of fools 2610 the great god that formed all things both rewardeth the fool and rewardeth transgressors 2611 as a dog returneth to his vomit so a fool returneth to his folly 2612 seest thou a man wise in his own conceit there is more hope of a fool than of him 2613 the slothful man saith there is a lion in the way a lion is in the streets 2614 as the door turneth upon his hinges so doth the slothful upon his bed 2615 the slothful hideth his hand in his bosom it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth 2616 the sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason 2617 he that passeth by and meddleth with strife belonging not to him is like one that taketh a dog by the ears 2618 as a mad man who casteth firebrands arrows and death 2619 so is the man that deceiveth his neighbour and saith am not i in sport 2620 where no wood is there the fire goeth out so where there is no talebearer the strife ceaseth 2621 as coals are to burning coals and wood to fire so is a contentious man to kindle strife 2622 the words of a talebearer are as wounds and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly 2623 burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross 2624 he that hateth dissembleth with his lips and layeth up deceit within him 2625 when he speaketh fair believe him not for there are seven abominations in his heart 2626 whose hatred is covered by deceit his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation 2627 whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein and he that rolleth a stone it will return upon him 2628 a lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it and a flattering mouth worketh ruin 271 boast not thyself of to morrow for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth 272 let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth a stranger and not thine own lips 273 a stone is heavy and the sand weighty but a fools wrath is heavier than them both 274 wrath is cruel and anger is outrageous but who is able to stand before envy 275 open rebuke is better than secret love 276 faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful 277 the full soul loatheth an honeycomb but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet 278 as a bird that wandereth from her nest so is a man that wandereth from his place 279 ointment and perfume rejoice the heart so doth the sweetness of a mans friend by hearty counsel 2710 thine own friend and thy fathers friend forsake not neither go into thy brothers house in the day of thy calamity for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off 2711 my son be wise and make my heart glad that i may answer him that reproacheth me 2712 a prudent man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the simple pass on and are punished 2713 take his garment that is surety for a stranger and take a pledge of him for a strange woman 2714 he that blesseth his friend with a loud voice rising early in the morning it shall be counted a curse to him 2715 a continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike 2716 whosoever hideth her hideth the wind and the ointment of his right hand which bewrayeth itself 2717 iron sharpeneth iron so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend 2718 whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured 2719 as in water face answereth to face so the heart of man to man 2720 hell and destruction are never full so the eyes of man are never satisfied 2721 as the fining pot for silver and the furnace for gold so is a man to his praise 2722 though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle yet will not his foolishness depart from him 2723 be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks and look well to thy herds 2724 for riches are not for ever and doth the crown endure to every generation 2725 the hay appeareth and the tender grass sheweth itself and herbs of the mountains are gathered 2726 the lambs are for thy clothing and the goats are the price of the field 2727 and thou shalt have goats milk enough for thy food for the food of thy household and for the maintenance for thy maidens 281 the wicked flee when no man pursueth but the righteous are bold as a lion 282 for the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged 283 a poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food 284 they that forsake the law praise the wicked but such as keep the law contend with them 285 evil men understand not judgment but they that seek the lord understand all things 286 better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness than he that is perverse in his ways though he be rich 287 whoso keepeth the law is a wise son but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father 288 he that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor 289 he that turneth away his ear from hearing the law even his prayer shall be abomination 2810 whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way he shall fall himself into his own pit but the upright shall have good things in possession 2811 the rich man is wise in his own conceit but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out 2812 when righteous men do rejoice there is great glory but when the wicked rise a man is hidden 2813 he that covereth his sins shall not prosper but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy 2814 happy is the man that feareth alway but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief 2815 as a roaring lion and a ranging bear so is a wicked ruler over the poor people 2816 the prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days 2817 a man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit let no man stay him 2818 whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once 2819 he that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough 2820 a faithful man shall abound with blessings but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent 2821 to have respect of persons is not good for for a piece of bread that man will transgress 2822 he that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him 2823 he that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue 2824 whoso robbeth his father or his mother and saith it is no transgression the same is the companion of a destroyer 2825 he that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife but he that putteth his trust in the lord shall be made fat 2826 he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool but whoso walketh wisely he shall be delivered 2827 he that giveth unto the poor shall not lack but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse 2828 when the wicked rise men hide themselves but when they perish the righteous increase 291 he that being often reproved hardeneth his neck shall suddenly be destroyed and that without remedy 292 when the righteous are in authority the people rejoice but when the wicked beareth rule the people mourn 293 whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance 294 the king by judgment establisheth the land but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it 295 a man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet 296 in the transgression of an evil man there is a snare but the righteous doth sing and rejoice 297 the righteous considereth the cause of the poor but the wicked regardeth not to know it 298 scornful men bring a city into a snare but wise men turn away wrath 299 if a wise man contendeth with a foolish man whether he rage or laugh there is no rest 2910 the bloodthirsty hate the upright but the just seek his soul 2911 a fool uttereth all his mind but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards 2912 if a ruler hearken to lies all his servants are wicked 2913 the poor and the deceitful man meet together the lord lighteneth both their eyes 2914 the king that faithfully judgeth the poor his throne shall be established for ever 2915 the rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame 2916 when the wicked are multiplied transgression increaseth but the righteous shall see their fall 2917 correct thy son and he shall give thee rest yea he shall give delight unto thy soul 2918 where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he 2919 a servant will not be corrected by words for though he understand he will not answer 2920 seest thou a man that is hasty in his words there is more hope of a fool than of him 2921 he that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length 2922 an angry man stirreth up strife and a furious man aboundeth in transgression 2923 a mans pride shall bring him low but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit 2924 whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul he heareth cursing and bewrayeth it not 2925 the fear of man bringeth a snare but whoso putteth his trust in the lord shall be safe 2926 many seek the rulers favour but every mans judgment cometh from the lord 2927 an unjust man is an abomination to the just and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked 301 the words of agur the son of jakeh even the prophecy the man spake unto ithiel even unto ithiel and ucal 302 surely i am more brutish than any man and have not the understanding of a man 303 i neither learned wisdom nor have the knowledge of the holy 304 who hath ascended up into heaven or descended who hath gathered the wind in his fists who hath bound the waters in a garment who hath established all the ends of the earth what is his name and what is his sons name if thou canst tell 305 every word of god is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him 306 add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar 307 two things have i required of thee deny me them not before i die 308 remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with food convenient for me 309 lest i be full and deny thee and say who is the lord or lest i be poor and steal and take the name of my god in vain 3010 accuse not a servant unto his master lest he curse thee and thou be found guilty 3011 there is a generation that curseth their father and doth not bless their mother 3012 there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes and yet is not washed from their filthiness 3013 there is a generation o how lofty are their eyes and their eyelids are lifted up 3014 there is a generation whose teeth are as swords and their jaw teeth as knives to devour the poor from off the earth and the needy from among men 3015 the horseleach hath two daughters crying give give there are three things that are never satisfied yea four things say not it is enough 3016 the grave and the barren womb the earth that is not filled with water and the fire that saith not it is enough 3017 the eye that mocketh at his father and despiseth to obey his mother the ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young eagles shall eat it 3018 there be three things which are too wonderful for me yea four which i know not 3019 the way of an eagle in the air the way of a serpent upon a rock the way of a ship in the midst of the sea and the way of a man with a maid 3020 such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith i have done no wickedness 3021 for three things the earth is disquieted and for four which it cannot bear 3022 for a servant when he reigneth and a fool when he is filled with meat 3023 for an odious woman when she is married and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress 3024 there be four things which are little upon the earth but they are exceeding wise 3025 the ants are a people not strong yet they prepare their meat in the summer 3026 the conies are but a feeble folk yet make they their houses in the rocks 3027 the locusts have no king yet go they forth all of them by bands 3028 the spider taketh hold with her hands and is in kings palaces 3029

is no rising up 3032 if thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself or if thou hast thought evil lay thine hand upon thy mouth 3033 surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife 311 the words of king lemuel the prophecy that his mother taught him 312 what my son and what the son of my womb and what the son of my vows 313 give not thy strength unto women nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings 314 it is not for kings o lemuel it is not for kings to drink wine nor for princes strong drink 315 lest they drink and forget the law and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted 316 give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts 317 let

she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life 3113 she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands 3114 she is like the merchants ships she bringeth her food from afar 3115

daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all 3130 favour is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised 3131 give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates ecclesiastes or the preacher 11 the words of the preacher the son of david king in jerusalem 12 vanity of vanities saith the preacher vanity of vanities all is vanity 13 what profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun 14 one generation passeth away and another generation cometh but the earth abideth for ever 15 the sun also ariseth and the sun goeth down and hasteth to his place where he arose 16 the wind goeth toward the south and turneth about unto the north it whirleth about continually and the wind returneth again according to his circuits 17 all the rivers run into the sea yet the sea is not full unto the place from whence the rivers come thither they return again 18 all things are full of labour man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing 19 the thing that hath been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun 110 is there any thing whereof it may be said see this is new it hath been already of old time which was before us 111 there is no remembrance of former things neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after 112 i the preacher was king over israel in jerusalem 113 and i gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven this sore travail hath god given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith 114 i have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit 115 that which is crooked cannot be made straight and that which is wanting cannot be numbered 116 i communed with mine own heart saying lo i am come to great estate and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in jerusalem yea my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge 117 and i gave my heart to know wisdom and to know madness and folly i perceived that this also is vexation of spirit 118 for in much wisdom is much grief and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow 21 i said in mine heart go to now i will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also is vanity 22 i said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what doeth it 23 i sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom and to lay hold on folly till i might see what was that good for the sons of men which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life 24 i made me great works i builded me houses i planted me vineyards 25 i made me gardens and orchards and i planted trees in them of all kind of fruits 26 i made me pools of water to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees 27 i got me servants and maidens and had servants born in my house also i had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in jerusalem before me 28 i gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces i gat me men singers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instruments and that of all sorts 29 so i was great and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me 210 and whatsoever mine eyes desired i kept not from them i withheld not my heart from any joy for my heart rejoiced in all my labour and this was my portion of all my labour 211 then i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labour that i had laboured to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit under the sun 212 and i turned myself to behold wisdom and madness and folly for what can the man do that cometh after the king even that which hath been already done 213 then i saw that wisdom excelleth folly as far as light excelleth darkness 214 the wise mans eyes are in his head but the fool walketh in darkness and i myself perceived also that one event happeneth to them all 215 then said i in my heart as it happeneth to the fool so it happeneth even to me and why was i then more wise then i said in my heart that this also is vanity 216 for there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten and how dieth the wise man as the fool 217 therefore i hated life because the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me for all is vanity and vexation of spirit 218 yea i hated all my labour which i had taken under the sun because i should leave it unto the man that shall be after me 219 and who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool yet shall he have rule over all my labour wherein i have laboured and wherein i have shewed myself wise under the sun this is also vanity 220 therefore i went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labour which i took under the sun 221 for there is a man whose labour is in wisdom and in knowledge and in equity yet to a man that hath not laboured therein shall he leave it for his portion this also is vanity and a great evil 222 for what hath man of all his labour and of the vexation of his heart wherein he hath laboured under the sun 223 for all his days are sorrows and his travail grief yea his heart taketh not rest in the night this is also vanity 224 there is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour this also i saw that it was from the hand of god 225 for who can eat or who else can hasten hereunto more than i 226 for god giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom and knowledge and joy but to the sinner he giveth travail to gather and to heap up that he may give to him that is good before god this also is vanity and vexation of spirit 31 to every thing there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven 32 a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to pluck up that which is planted 33 a time to kill and a time to heal a time to break down and a time to build up 34 a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance 35 a time to cast away stones and a time to gather stones together a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing 36 a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away 37 a time to rend and a time to sew a time to keep silence and a time to speak 38 a time to love and a time to hate a time of war and a time of peace 39 what profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth 310 i have seen the travail which god hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it 311 he hath made every thing beautiful in his time also he hath set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to the end 312 i know that there is no good in them but for a man to rejoice and to do good in his life 313 and also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labour it is the gift of god 314 i know that whatsoever god doeth it shall be for ever nothing can be put to it nor any thing taken from it and god doeth it that men should fear before him 315 that which hath been is now and that which is to be hath already been and god requireth that which is past 316 and moreover i saw under the sun the place of judgment that wickedness was there and the place of righteousness that iniquity was there 317 i said in mine heart god shall judge the righteous and the wicked for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work 318 i said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men that god might manifest them and that they might see that they themselves are beasts 319 for that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts even one thing befalleth them as the one dieth so dieth the other yea they have all one breath so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast for all is vanity 320 all go unto one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again 321 who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth 322 wherefore i perceive that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works for that is his portion for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him 41 so i returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun and behold the tears of such as were oppressed and they had no comforter and on the side of their oppressors there was power but they had no comforter 42 wherefore i praised the dead which are already dead more than the living which are yet alive 43 yea better is he than both they which hath not yet been who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun 44 again i considered all travail and every right work that for this a man is envied of his neighbour this is also vanity and vexation of spirit 45 the fool foldeth his hands together and eateth his own flesh 46 better is an handful with quietness than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit 47 then i returned and i saw vanity under the sun 48 there is one alone and there is not a second yea he hath neither child nor brother yet is there no end of all his labour neither is his eye satisfied with riches neither saith he for whom do i labour and bereave my soul of good this is also vanity yea it is a sore travail 49 two are better than one because they have a good reward for their labour 410 for if they fall the one will lift up his fellow but woe to him that is alone when he falleth for he hath not another to help him up 411 again if two lie together then they have heat but how can one be warm alone 412 and if one prevail against him two shall withstand him and a threefold cord is not quickly broken 413 better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no more be admonished 414 for out of prison he cometh to reign whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor 415 i considered all the living which walk under the sun with the second child that shall stand up in his stead 416 there is no end of all the people even of all that have been before them they also that come after shall not rejoice in him surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit 51 keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of god and be more ready to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evil 52 be not rash with thy mouth and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before god for god is in heaven and thou upon earth therefore let thy words be few 53 for a dream cometh through the multitude of business and a fools voice is known by multitude of words 54 when thou vowest a vow unto god defer not to pay it for he hath no pleasure in fools pay that which thou hast vowed 55 better is it that thou shouldest not vow than that thou shouldest vow and not pay 56 suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin neither say thou before the angel that it was an error wherefore should god be angry at thy voice and destroy the work of thine hands 57 for in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities but fear thou god 58 if thou seest the oppression of the poor and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province marvel not at the matter for he that is higher than the highest regardeth and there be higher than they 59 moreover the profit of the earth is for all the king himself is served by the field 510 he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he that loveth abundance with increase this is also vanity 511 when goods increase they are increased that eat them and what good is there to the owners thereof saving the beholding of them with their eyes 512 the sleep of a labouring man is sweet whether he eat little or much but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep 513 there is a sore evil which i have seen under the sun namely riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt 514 but those riches perish by evil travail and he begetteth a son and there is nothing in his hand 515 as he came forth of his mothers womb naked shall he return to go as he came and shall take nothing of his labour which he may carry away in his hand 516 and this also is a sore evil that in all points as he came so shall he go and what profit hath he that hath laboured for the wind 517 all his days also he eateth in darkness and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness 518 behold that which i have seen it is good and comely for one to eat and to drink and to enjoy the good of all his labour that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life which god giveth him for it is his portion 519 every man also to whom god hath given riches and wealth and hath given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour this is the gift of god 520 for he shall not much remember the days of his life because god answereth him in the joy of his heart 61 there is an evil which i have seen under the sun and it is common among men 62 a man to whom god hath given riches wealth and honour so that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth yet god giveth him not power to eat thereof but a stranger eateth it this is vanity and it is an evil disease 63 if a man beget an hundred children and live many years so that the days of his years be many and his soul be not filled with good and also that he have no burial i say that an untimely birth is better than he 64 for he cometh in with vanity and departeth in darkness and his name shall be covered with darkness 65 moreover he hath not seen the sun nor known any thing this hath more rest than the other 66 yea though he live a thousand years twice told yet hath he seen no good do not all go to one place 67 all the labour of man is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not filled 68 for what hath the wise more than the fool what hath the poor that knoweth to walk before the living 69 better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the desire this is also vanity and vexation of spirit 610 that which hath been is named already and it is known that it is man neither may he contend with him that is mightier than he 611 seeing there be many things that increase vanity what is man the better 612 for who knoweth what is good for man in this life all the days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow for who can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun 71 a good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of ones birth 72 it is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart 73 sorrow is better than laughter for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better 74 the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth 75 it is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than for a man to hear the song of fools 76 for as the crackling of thorns under a pot so is the laughter of the fool this also is vanity 77 surely oppression maketh a wise man mad and a gift destroyeth the heart 78 better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit 79 be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry for anger resteth in the bosom of fools 710 say not thou what is the cause that the former days were better than these for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this 711 wisdom is good with an inheritance and by it there is profit to them that see the sun 712 for wisdom is a defence and money is a defence but the excellency of knowledge is that wisdom giveth life to them that have it 713 consider the work of god for who can make that straight which he hath made crooked 714 in the day of prosperity be joyful but in the day of adversity consider god also hath set the one over against the other to the end that man should find nothing after him 715 all things have i seen in the days of my vanity there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness 716 be not righteous over much neither make thyself over wise why shouldest thou destroy thyself  717 be not over much wicked neither be thou foolish why shouldest thou die before thy time 718 it is good that thou shouldest take hold of this yea also from this withdraw not thine hand for he that feareth god shall come forth of them all 719 wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city 720 for there is not a just man upon earth that doeth good and sinneth not 721 also take no heed unto all words that are spoken lest thou hear thy servant curse thee 722 for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others 723 all this have i proved by wisdom i said i will be wise but it was far from me 724 that which is far off and exceeding deep who can find it out 725 i applied mine heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of folly even of foolishness and madness 726 and i find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands as bands whoso pleaseth god shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her 727 behold this have i found saith the preacher counting one by one to find out the account 728 which yet my soul seeketh but i find not one man among a thousand have i found but a woman among all those have i not found 729 lo this only have i found that god hath made man upright but they have sought out many inventions 81 who is as the wise man and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing a mans wisdom maketh his face to shine and the boldness of his face shall be changed 82 i counsel thee to keep the kings commandment and that in regard of the oath of god 83 be not hasty to go out of his sight stand not in an evil thing for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him 84 where the word of a king is there is power and who may say unto him what doest thou 85 whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing and a wise mans heart discerneth both time and judgment 86 because to every purpose there is time and judgment therefore the misery of man is great upon him 87 for he knoweth not that which shall be for who can tell him when it shall be 88 there is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit neither hath he power in the day of death and there is no discharge in that war neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it 89 all this have i seen and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt 810 and so i saw the wicked buried who had come and gone from the place of the holy and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done this is also vanity 811 because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil 812 though a sinner do evil an hundred times and his days be prolonged yet surely i know that it shall be well with them that fear god which fear before him 813 but it shall not be well with the wicked neither shall he prolong his days which are as a shadow because he feareth not before god 814 there is a vanity which is done upon the earth that there be just men unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked again there be wicked men to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous i said that this also is vanity 815 then i commended mirth because a man hath no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life which god giveth him under the sun 816 when i applied mine heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done upon the earth for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes 817 then i beheld all the work of god that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun because though a man labour to seek it out yet he shall not find it yea farther though a wise man think to know it yet shall he not be able to find it 91 for all this i considered in my heart even to declare all this that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of god no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them 92 all things come alike to all there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked to the good and to the clean and to the unclean to him that sacrificeth and to him that sacrificeth not as is the good so is the sinner and he that sweareth as he that feareth an oath 93 this is an evil among all things that are done under the sun that there is one event unto all yea also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil and madness is in their heart while they live and after that they go to the dead 94 for to him that is joined to all the living there is hope for a living dog is better than a dead lion 95 for the living know that they shall die but the dead know not any thing neither have they any more a reward for the memory of them is forgotten 96 also their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun 97 go thy way eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a merry heart for god now accepteth thy works 98 let thy garments be always white and let thy head lack no ointment 99 live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity which he hath given thee under the sun all the days of thy vanity for that is thy portion in this life and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun 910 whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest 911 i returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong neither yet bread to the wise nor yet riches to men of understanding nor yet favour to men of skill but time and chance happeneth to them all 912 for man also knoweth not his time as the fishes that are taken in an evil net and as the birds that are caught in the snare so are the sons of men snared in an evil time when it falleth suddenly upon them 913 this wisdom have i seen also under the sun and it seemed great unto me 914 there was a little city and few men within it and there came a great king against it and besieged it and built great bulwarks against it 915 now there was found in it a poor wise man and he by his wisdom delivered the city yet no man remembered that same poor man 916 then said i wisdom is better than strength nevertheless the poor mans wisdom is despised and his words are not heard 917 the words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools 918 wisdom is better than weapons of war but one sinner destroyeth much good 101 dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour 102 a wise mans heart is at his right hand but a fools heart at his left 103 yea also when he that is a fool walketh by the way his wisdom faileth him and he saith to every one that he is a fool 104 if the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee leave not thy place for yielding pacifieth great offences 105 there is an evil which i have seen under the sun as an error which proceedeth from the ruler 106 folly is set in great dignity and the rich sit in low place 107 i have seen servants upon horses and princes walking as servants upon the earth 108 he that diggeth a pit shall fall into it and whoso breaketh an hedge a serpent shall bite him 109 whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby 1010 if the iron be blunt and he do not whet the edge then must he put to more strength but wisdom is profitable to direct 1011 surely the serpent will bite without enchantment and a babbler is no better 1012 the words of a wise mans mouth are gracious but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself 1013 the beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness and the end of his talk is mischievous madness 1014 a fool also is full of words a man cannot tell what shall be and what shall be after him who can tell him 1015 the labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them because he knoweth not how to go to the city 1016 woe to thee o land when thy king is a child and thy princes eat in the morning 1017 blessed art thou o land when thy king is the son of nobles and thy princes eat in due season for strength and not for drunkenness 1018 by much slothfulness the building decayeth and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through 1019 a feast is made for laughter and wine maketh merry but money answereth all things 1020 curse not the king no not in thy thought and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber for a bird of the air shall carry the voice and that which hath wings shall tell the matter 111 cast thy bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after many days 112 give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth 113 if the clouds be full of rain they empty themselves upon the earth and if the tree fall toward the south or toward the north in the place where the tree falleth there it shall be 114 he that observeth the wind shall not sow and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap 115 as thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child even so thou knowest not the works of god who maketh all 116 in the morning sow thy seed and in the evening withhold not thine hand for thou knowest not whether shall prosper either this or that or whether they both shall be alike good 117 truly the light is sweet and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun 118 but if a man live many years and rejoice in them all yet let him remember the days of darkness for they shall be many all that cometh is vanity 119 rejoice o young man in thy youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things god will bring thee into judgment 1110 therefore remove sorrow from thy heart and put away evil from thy flesh for childhood and youth are vanity 121 remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them 122 while the sun or the light or the moon or the stars be not darkened nor the clouds return after the rain 123 in the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong men shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are few and those that look out of the windows be darkened 124 and the doors shall be shut in the streets when the sound of the grinding is low and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low 125 also when they shall be afraid of that which is high and fears shall be in the way and the almond tree shall flourish and the grasshopper shall be a burden and desire shall fail because man goeth to his long home and the mourners go about the streets 126 or ever the silver cord be loosed or the golden bowl be broken or the pitcher be broken at the fountain or the wheel broken at the cistern 127 then shall the dust return to the earth as it was and the spirit shall return unto god who gave it 128 vanity of vanities saith the preacher all is vanity 129 and moreover because the preacher was wise he still taught the people knowledge yea he gave good heed and sought out and set in order many proverbs 1210 the preacher sought to find out acceptable words and that which was written was upright even words of truth 1211 the words of the wise are as goads and as nails fastened by the masters of assemblies which are given from one shepherd 1212 and further by these my son be admonished of making many books there is no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh 1213 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man 1214 for god shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil the song of solomon 11 the song of songs which is solomons 12 let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for thy love is better than wine 13 because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth therefore do the virgins love thee 14 draw me we will run after thee the king hath brought me into his chambers we will be glad and rejoice in thee we will remember thy love more than wine the upright love thee 15 i am black but comely o ye daughters of jerusalem as the tents of kedar as the curtains of solomon 16 look not upon me because i am black because the sun hath looked upon me my mothers children were angry with me they made me the keeper of the vineyards but mine own vineyard have i not kept 17 tell me o thou whom my soul loveth where thou feedest where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon for why should i be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions 18 if thou know not o thou fairest among women go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock and feed thy kids beside the shepherds tents 19 i have compared thee o my love to a company of horses in pharaohs chariots 110 thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels thy neck with chains of gold 111 we will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver 112 while the king sitteth at his table my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof 113 a bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts 114 my beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of engedi 115 behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thou hast doves eyes 116 behold thou art fair my beloved yea pleasant also our bed is green 117 the beams of our house are cedar and our rafters of fir 21 i am the rose of sharon and the lily of the valleys 22 as the lily among thorns so is my love among the daughters 23 as the apple tree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons i sat down under his shadow with great delight and his fruit was sweet to my taste 24 he brought me to the banqueting house and his banner over me was love 25 stay me with flagons comfort me with apples for i am sick of love 26 his left hand is under my head and his right hand doth embrace me 27 i charge you o ye daughters of jerusalem by the roes and by the hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he please 28 the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills 29 my beloved is like a roe or a young hart behold he standeth behind our wall he looketh forth at the windows shewing himself through the lattice 210 my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away 211 for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone 212 the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land 213 the fig tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell arise my love my fair one and come away 214 o my dove that art in the clefts of the rock in the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely 215 take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the vines for our vines have tender grapes 216 my beloved is mine and i am his he feedeth among the lilies 217 until the day break and the shadows flee away turn my beloved and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of bether 31 by night on my bed i sought him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i found him not 32 i will rise now and go about the city in the streets and in the broad ways i will seek him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i found him not 33 the watchmen that go about the city found me to whom i said saw ye him whom my soul loveth 34 it was but a little that i passed from them but i found him whom my soul loveth i held him and would not let him go until i had brought him into my mothers house and into the chamber of her that conceived me 35 i charge you o ye daughters of jerusalem by the roes and by the hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he please 36 who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke perfumed with myrrh and frankincense with all powders of the merchant 37 behold his bed which is solomons threescore valiant men are about it of the valiant of israel 38 they all hold swords being expert in war every man hath his sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night 39 king solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of lebanon 310 he made the pillars thereof of silver the bottom thereof of gold the covering of it of purple the midst thereof being paved with love for the daughters of jerusalem 311 go forth o ye daughters of zion and behold king solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals and in the day of the gladness of his heart 41 behold thou art fair my love behold thou art fair thou hast doves eyes within thy locks thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from mount gilead 42 thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn which came up from the washing whereof every one bear twins and none is barren among them 43 thy lips are like a thread of scarlet and thy speech is comely thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks 44 thy neck is like the tower of david builded for an armoury whereon there hang a thousand bucklers all shields of mighty men 45 thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins which feed among the lilies 46 until the day break and the shadows flee away i will get me to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense 47 thou art all fair my love there is no spot in thee 48 come with me from lebanon my spouse with me from lebanon look from the top of amana from the top of shenir and hermon from the lions dens from the mountains of the leopards 49 thou hast ravished my heart my sister my spouse thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes with one chain of thy neck 410 how fair is thy love my sister my spouse how much better is thy love than wine and the smell of thine ointments than all spices 411 thy lips o my spouse drop as the honeycomb honey and milk are under thy tongue and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of lebanon 412 a garden inclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed 413 thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates with pleasant fruits camphire with spikenard 414 spikenard and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all the chief spices 415 a fountain of gardens a well of living waters and streams from lebanon 416 awake o north wind and come thou south blow upon my garden that the spices thereof may flow out let my beloved come into his garden and eat his pleasant fruits 51 i am come into my garden my sister my spouse i have gathered my myrrh

that knocketh saying open to me my sister my love my dove my undefiled for my head is filled with dew and my locks with the drops of the night 53 i have put off my coat how shall i put it on i have washed my feet how shall i defile them 54 my beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door and my bowels were moved for him 55 i rose up to open to my beloved and my hands dropped with myrrh and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh upon the handles of the lock 56 i opened to my beloved but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone my soul failed when he spake i sought him but i could not find him i called him but he gave me no answer 57 the watchmen that went about the city found me they smote me they wounded me the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me 58 i charge you o daughters of jerusalem if ye find my beloved that ye tell him that i am sick of love 59 what is thy beloved more than another beloved o thou fairest among women what is thy beloved more than another beloved that thou dost so charge us 510 my beloved is white and ruddy the chiefest among ten thousand 511 his head is as the most fine gold his locks are bushy and black as a raven 512 his eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters washed with milk and fitly set 513 his cheeks are as a bed of spices as sweet flowers his lips like lilies dropping sweet smelling myrrh 514 his hands are as gold rings set with the beryl his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires 515 his legs are as pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold his countenance is as lebanon excellent as the cedars 516 his mouth is most sweet yea he is altogether lovely this is my beloved and this is my friend o daughters of jerusalem 61 whither is thy beloved gone o thou fairest among women whither is thy beloved turned aside that we may seek him with thee 62 my beloved is gone down into his garden to the beds of spices to feed in the gardens and to gather lilies 63 i am my beloveds and my beloved is mine he feedeth among the lilies 64 thou art beautiful o my love as tirzah comely as jerusalem terrible as an army with banners 65 turn away thine eyes from me for they have overcome me thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from gilead 66 thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing whereof every one beareth twins and there is not one barren among them 67 as a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks 68 there are threescore queens and fourscore concubines and virgins without number 69 my dove my undefiled is but one she is the only one of her mother she is the choice one of her that bare her the daughters saw her and blessed her yea the queens and the concubines and they praised her 610 who is she that looketh forth as the morning fair as the moon clear as the sun and terrible as an army with banners 611 i went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded 612 or ever i was aware my soul made me like the chariots of amminadib 613 return return o shulamite return return that we may look upon thee what will ye see in the shulamite as it were the company of two armies 71 how beautiful are thy feet with shoes o princes daughter the joints of thy thighs are like jewels the work of the hands of a cunning workman 72 thy navel is like a round goblet which wanteth not liquor thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies 73 thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins 74 thy neck is as a tower of ivory thine eyes like the fishpools in heshbon by the gate of bathrabbim thy nose is as the tower of lebanon which looketh toward damascus 75 thine head upon thee is like carmel and the hair of thine head like purple the king is held in the galleries 76 how fair and how pleasant art thou o love for delights 77 this thy stature is like to a palm tree and thy breasts to clusters of grapes 78 i said i will go up to the palm tree i will take hold of the boughs thereof now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine and the smell of thy nose like apples 79 and the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved that goeth down sweetly causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak 710 i am my beloveds and his desire is toward me 711 come my beloved let us go forth into the field let us lodge in the villages 712 let us get up early to the vineyards let us see if the vine flourish whether the tender grape appear and the pomegranates bud forth there will i give thee my loves 713 the mandrakes give a smell and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits new and old which i have laid up for thee o my beloved 81 o that thou wert as my brother that sucked the breasts of my mother when i should find thee without i would kiss thee yea i should not be despised 82 i would lead thee and bring thee into my mothers house who would instruct me i would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate 83 his left hand should be under my head and his right hand should embrace me 84 i charge you o daughters of jerusalem that ye stir not up nor awake my love until he please 85 who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved i raised thee up under the apple tree there thy mother brought thee forth there she brought thee forth that bare thee 86 set me as a seal upon thine heart as a seal upon thine arm for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave the coals thereof are coals of fire which hath a most vehement flame 87 many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would utterly be contemned 88 we have a little sister and she hath no breasts what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for 89 if she be a wall we will build upon her a palace of silver and if she be a door we will inclose her with boards of cedar 810 i am a wall and my breasts like towers then was i in his eyes as one that found favour 811 solomon had a vineyard at baalhamon he let out the vineyard unto keepers every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver 812 my vineyard which is mine is before me thou o solomon must have a thousand and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred 813 thou that dwellest in the gardens the companions hearken to thy voice cause me to hear it 814 make haste my beloved and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices the book of the prophet isaiah 11 the vision of isaiah the son of amoz which he saw concerning judah and jerusalem in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah 12 hear o heavens and give ear o earth for the lord hath spoken i have nourished and brought up children and they have rebelled against me 13 the ox knoweth his owner and the ass his masters crib but israel doth not know my people doth not consider 14 ah sinful nation a people laden with iniquity a seed of evildoers children that are corrupters they have forsaken the lord they have provoked the holy one of israel unto anger they are gone away backward 15 why should ye be stricken any more ye will revolt more and more the whole head is sick and the whole heart faint 16 from the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it but wounds and bruises and putrifying sores they have not been closed neither bound up neither mollified with ointment 17 your country is desolate your cities are burned with fire your land strangers devour it in your presence and it is desolate as overthrown by strangers 18 and the daughter of zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers as a besieged city 19 except the lord of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant we should have been as sodom and we should have been like unto gomorrah 110 hear the word of the lord ye rulers of sodom give ear unto the law of our god ye people of gomorrah 111 to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me saith the lord i am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts and i delight not in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he goats 112 when ye come to appear before me who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts 113 bring no more vain oblations incense is an abomination unto me the new moons and sabbaths the calling of assemblies i cannot away with it is iniquity even the solemn meeting 114 your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth they are a trouble unto me i am weary to bear them 115 and when ye spread forth your hands i will hide mine eyes from you yea when ye make many prayers i will not hear your hands are full of blood 116 wash you make you clean put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil 117 learn to do well seek judgment relieve the oppressed judge the fatherless plead for the widow 118 come now and let us reason together saith the lord though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool 119 if ye be willing and obedient ye shall eat the good of the land 120 but if ye refuse and rebel ye shall be devoured with the sword for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it 121 how is the faithful city become an harlot it was full of judgment righteousness lodged in it but now murderers 122 thy silver is become dross thy wine mixed with water 123 thy princes are rebellious and companions of thieves every one loveth gifts and followeth after rewards they judge not the fatherless neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them 124 therefore saith the lord the lord of hosts the mighty one of israel ah i will ease me of mine adversaries and avenge me of mine enemies 125 and i will turn my hand upon thee and purely purge away thy dross and take away all thy tin 126 and i will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counsellors as at the beginning afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness the faithful city 127 zion shall be redeemed with judgment and her converts with righteousness 128 and the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together and they that forsake the lord shall be consumed 129 for they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen 130 for ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth and as a garden that hath no water 131 and the strong shall be as tow and the maker of it as a spark and they shall both burn together and none shall quench them 21 the word that isaiah the son of amoz saw concerning judah and jerusalem 22 and it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the lords house shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and all nations shall flow unto it 23 and many people shall go and say come ye and let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for out of zion shall go forth the law and the word of the lord from jerusalem 24 and he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more 25 o house of jacob come ye and let us walk in the light of the lord 26 therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of jacob because they be replenished from the east and are soothsayers like the philistines and they please themselves in the children of strangers 27 their land also is full of silver and gold neither is there any end of their treasures their land is also full of horses neither is there any end of their chariots 28 their land also is full of idols they worship the work of their own hands that which their own fingers have made 29 and the mean man boweth down and the great man humbleth himself therefore forgive them not 210 enter into the rock and hide thee in the dust for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty 211 the lofty looks of man shall be humbled and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day 212 for the day of the lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and lofty and upon every one that is lifted up and he shall be brought low 213 and upon all the cedars of lebanon that are high and lifted up and upon all the oaks of bashan 214 and upon all the high mountains and upon all the hills that are lifted up 215 and upon every high tower and upon every fenced wall 216 and upon all the ships of tarshish and upon all pleasant pictures 217 and the loftiness of man shall be bowed down and the haughtiness of men shall be made low and the lord alone shall be exalted in that day 218 and the idols he shall utterly abolish 219 and they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the caves of the earth for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth 220 in that day a man shall cast his idols of silver and his idols of gold which they made each one for himself to worship to the moles and to the bats 221 to go into the clefts of the rocks and into the tops of the ragged rocks for fear of the lord and for the glory of his majesty when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth 222 cease ye from man whose breath is in his nostrils for wherein is he to be accounted of  31 for behold the lord the lord of hosts doth take away from jerusalem and from judah the stay and the staff the whole stay of bread and the whole stay of water 32 the mighty man and the man of war the judge and the prophet and the prudent and the ancient 33 the captain of fifty and the honourable man and the counsellor and the cunning artificer and the eloquent orator 34 and i will give children to be their princes and babes shall rule over them 35 and the people shall be oppressed every one by another and every one by his neighbour the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient and the base against the honourable 36 when a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father saying thou hast clothing be thou our ruler and let this ruin be under thy hand 37 in that day shall he swear saying i will not be an healer for in my house is neither bread nor clothing make me not a ruler of the people 38 for jerusalem is ruined and judah is fallen because their tongue and their doings are against the lord to provoke the eyes of his glory 39 the shew of their countenance doth witness against them and they declare their sin as sodom they hide it not woe unto their soul for they have rewarded evil unto themselves 310 say ye to the righteous that it shall be well with him for they shall eat the fruit of their doings 311 woe unto the wicked it shall be ill with him for the reward of his hands shall be given him 312 as for my people children are their oppressors and women rule over them o my people they which lead thee cause thee to err and destroy the way of thy paths 313 the lord standeth up to plead and standeth to judge the people 314 the lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people and the princes thereof for ye have eaten up the vineyard the spoil of the poor is in your houses 315 what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor saith the lord god of hosts 316 moreover the lord saith because the daughters of zion are haughty and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet 317 therefore the lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of zion and the lord will discover their secret parts 318 in that day the lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet and their cauls and their round tires like the moon 319 the chains and the bracelets and the mufflers 320 the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the tablets and the earrings 321 the rings and nose jewels 322 the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the wimples and the crisping pins 323 the glasses and the fine linen and the hoods and the vails 324 and it shall come to pass that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink and instead of a girdle a rent and instead of well set hair baldness and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth and burning instead of beauty 325 thy men shall fall by the sword and thy mighty in the war 326 and her gates shall lament and mourn and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground 41 and in that day seven women shall take hold of one man saying we will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach 42 in that day shall the branch of the lord be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of israel 43 and it shall come to pass that he that is left in zion and he that remaineth in jerusalem shall be called holy even every one that is written among the living in jerusalem 44 when the lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of zion and shall have purged the blood of jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning 45 and the lord will create upon every dwelling place of mount zion and upon her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and the shining of a flaming fire by night for upon all the glory shall be a defence 46 and there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain 51 now will i sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard my wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a very fruitful hill 52 and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a winepress therein and he looked that it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes 53 and now o inhabitants of jerusalem and men of judah judge i pray you betwixt me and my vineyard 54 what could have been done more to my vineyard that i have not done in it wherefore when i looked that it should bring forth grapes brought it forth wild grapes 55 and now go to i will tell you what i will do to my vineyard i will take away the hedge thereof and it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it shall be trodden down 56 and i will lay it waste it shall not be pruned nor digged but there shall come up briers and thorns i will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it 57 for the vineyard of the lord of hosts is the house of israel and the men of judah his pleasant plant and he looked for judgment but behold oppression for righteousness but behold a cry 58 woe unto them that join house to house that lay field to field till there be no place that they may be placed alone in the midst of the earth 59 in mine ears said the lord of hosts of a truth many houses shall be desolate even great and fair without inhabitant 510 yea ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah 511 woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink that continue until night till wine inflame them 512 and the harp and the viol the tabret and pipe and wine are in their feasts but they regard not the work of the lord neither consider the operation of his hands 513 therefore my people are gone into captivity because they have no knowledge and their honourable men are famished and their multitude dried up with thirst 514 therefore hell hath enlarged herself and opened her mouth without measure and their glory and their multitude and their pomp and he that rejoiceth shall descend into it 515 and the mean man shall be brought down and the mighty man shall be humbled and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled 516 but the lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment and god that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness 517 then shall the lambs feed after their manner and the waste places of the fat ones shall strangers eat 518 woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity and sin as it were with a cart rope 519 that say let him make speed and hasten his work that we may see it and let the counsel of the holy one of israel draw nigh and come that we may know it 520 woe unto them that call evil good and good evil that put darkness for light and light for darkness that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter 521 woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight 522 woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink 523 which justify the wicked for reward and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him 524 therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble and the flame consumeth the chaff so their root shall be as rottenness and their blossom shall go up as dust because they have cast away the law of the lord of hosts and despised the word of the holy one of israel 525 therefore is the anger of the lord kindled against his people and he hath stretched forth his hand against them and hath smitten them and the hills did tremble and their carcases were torn in the midst of the streets for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still 526 and he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth and behold they shall come with speed swiftly 527 none shall be weary nor stumble among them none shall slumber nor sleep neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed nor the latchet of their shoes be broken 528 whose arrows are sharp and all their bows bent their horses hoofs shall be counted like flint and their wheels like a whirlwind 529 their roaring shall be like a lion they shall roar like young lions yea they shall roar and lay hold of the prey and shall carry it away safe and none shall deliver it 530 and in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea and if one look unto the land behold darkness and sorrow and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof 61 in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple 62 above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly 63 and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory 64 and the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke 65 then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts 66 then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar 67 and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged 68 also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us then said i here am i send me 69 and he said go and tell this people hear ye indeed but understand not and see ye indeed but perceive not 610 make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and shut their eyes lest they see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and convert and be healed 611 then said i lord how long and he answered until the cities be wasted without inhabitant and the houses without man and the land be utterly desolate 612 and the lord have removed men far away and there be a great forsaking in the midst of the land 613 but yet in it shall be a tenth and it shall return and shall be eaten as a teil tree and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof 71 and it came to pass in the days of ahaz the son of jotham the son of uzziah king of judah that rezin the king of syria and pekah the son of remaliah king of israel went up toward jerusalem to war against it but could not prevail against it 72 and it was told the house of david saying syria is confederate with ephraim and his heart was moved and the heart of his people as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind 73 then said the lord unto isaiah go forth now to meet ahaz thou and shearjashub thy son at the end of the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers field 74 and say unto him take heed and be quiet fear not neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands for the fierce anger of rezin with syria and of the son of remaliah 75 because syria ephraim and the son of remaliah have taken evil counsel against thee saying 76 let us go up against judah and vex it and let us make a breach therein for us and set a king in the midst of it even the son of tabeal 77 thus saith the lord god it shall not stand neither shall it come to pass 78 for the head of syria is damascus and the head of damascus is rezin and within threescore and five years shall ephraim be broken that it be not a people 79 and the head of ephraim is samaria and the head of samaria is remaliahs son if ye will not believe surely ye shall not be established 710 moreover the lord spake again unto ahaz saying 711 ask thee a sign of the lord thy god ask it either in the depth or in the height above 712 but ahaz said i will not ask neither will i tempt the lord 713 and he said hear ye now o house of david is it a small thing for you to weary men but will ye weary my god also 714 therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name immanuel 715 butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good 716 for before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her kings 717 the lord shall bring upon thee and upon thy people and upon thy fathers house days that have not come from the day that ephraim departed from judah even the king of assyria 718 and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of egypt and for the bee that is in the land of assyria 719 and they shall come and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys and in the holes of the rocks and upon all thorns and upon all bushes 720 in the same day shall the lord shave with a razor that is hired namely by them beyond the river by the king of assyria the head and the hair of the feet and it shall also consume the beard 721 and it shall come to pass in that day that a man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep 722 and it shall come to pass for the abundance of milk that they shall give he shall eat butter for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land 723 and it shall come to pass in that day that every place shall be where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silverlings it shall even be for briers and thorns 724 with arrows and with bows shall men come thither because all the land shall become briers and thorns 725 and on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen and for the treading of lesser cattle 81 moreover the lord said unto me take thee a great roll and write in it with a mans pen concerning mahershalalhashbaz 82 and i took unto me faithful witnesses to record uriah the priest and zechariah the son of jeberechiah 83 and i went unto the prophetess and she conceived and bare a son then said the lord to me call his name mahershalalhashbaz 84 for before the child shall have knowledge to cry my father and my mother the riches of damascus and the spoil of samaria shall be taken away before the king of assyria 85 the lord spake also unto me again saying 86 forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of shiloah that go softly and rejoice in rezin and remaliahs son 87 now therefore behold the lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river strong and many even the king of assyria and all his glory and he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banks 88 and he shall pass through judah he shall overflow and go over he shall reach even to the neck and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land o immanuel 89 associate yourselves o ye people and ye shall be broken in pieces and give ear all ye of far countries gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces gird yourselves and ye shall be broken in pieces 810 take counsel together and it shall come to nought speak the word and it shall not stand for god is with us 811 for the lord spake thus to me with a strong hand and instructed me that i should not walk in the way of this people saying 812 say ye not a confederacy to all them to whom this people shall say a confederacy neither fear ye their fear nor be afraid 813 sanctify the lord of hosts himself and let him be your fear and let him be your dread 814 and he shall be for a sanctuary but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of israel for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of jerusalem 815 and many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken and be snared and be taken 816 bind up the testimony seal the law among my disciples 817 and i will wait upon the lord that hideth his face from the house of jacob and i will look for him 818 behold i and the children whom the lord hath given me are for signs and for wonders in israel from the lord of hosts which dwelleth in mount zion 819 and when they shall say unto you seek unto them that have familiar spirits and unto wizards that peep and that mutter should not a people seek unto their god for the living to the dead 820 to the law and to the testimony if they speak not according to this word it is because there is no light in them 821 and they shall pass through it hardly bestead and hungry and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry they shall fret themselves and curse their king and their god and look upward 822 and they shall look unto the earth and behold trouble and darkness dimness of anguish and they shall be driven to darkness 91 nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her vexation when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali and afterward did more grievously afflict her by the way of the sea beyond jordan in galilee of the nations 92 the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined 93 thou hast multiplied the nation and not increased the joy they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil 94 for thou hast broken the yoke of his burden and the staff of his shoulder the rod of his oppressor as in the day of midian 95 for every battle of the warrior is with confused noise and garments rolled in blood but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire 96 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace 97 of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever the zeal of the lord of hosts will perform this 98 the lord sent a word into jacob and it hath lighted upon israel 99 and all the people shall know even ephraim and the inhabitant of samaria that say in the pride and stoutness of heart 910 the bricks are fallen down but we will build with hewn stones the sycomores are cut down but we will change them into cedars 911 therefore the lord shall set up the adversaries of rezin against him and join his enemies together 912 the syrians before and the philistines behind and they shall devour israel with open mouth for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still 913 for the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them neither do they seek the lord of hosts 914 therefore the lord will cut off from israel head and tail branch and rush in one day 915 the ancient and honourable he is the head and the prophet that teacheth lies he is the tail 916 for the leaders of this people cause them to err and they that are led of them are destroyed 917 therefore the lord shall have no joy in their young men neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows for every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer and every mouth speaketh folly for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still 918 for wickedness burneth as the fire it shall devour the briers and thorns and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke 919 through the wrath of the lord of hosts is the land darkened and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire no man shall spare his brother 920 and he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry and he shall eat on the left hand and they shall not be satisfied they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm 921 manasseh ephraim and ephraim manasseh and they together shall be against judah for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still 101 woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees and that write grievousness which they have prescribed 102 to turn aside the needy from judgment and to take away the right from the poor of my people that widows may be their prey and that they may rob the fatherless 103 and what will ye do in the day of visitation and in the desolation which shall come from far to whom will ye flee for help and where will ye leave your glory 104 without me they shall bow down under the prisoners and they shall fall under the slain for all this his anger is not turned away but his hand is stretched out still 105 o assyrian the rod of mine anger and the staff in their hand is mine indignation 106 i will send him against an hypocritical nation and against the people of my wrath will i give him a charge to take the spoil and to take the prey and to tread them down like the mire of the streets 107 howbeit he meaneth not so neither doth his heart think so but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few 108 for he saith are not my princes altogether kings 109 is not calno as carchemish is not hamath as arpad is not samaria as damascus 1010 as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols and whose graven images did excel them of jerusalem and of samaria 1011 shall i not as i have done unto samaria and her idols so do to jerusalem and her idols 1012 wherefore it shall come to pass that when the lord hath performed his whole work upon mount zion and on jerusalem i will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of assyria and the glory of his high looks 1013 for he saith by the strength of my hand i have done it and by my wisdom for i am prudent and i have removed the bounds of the people and have robbed their treasures and i have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man 1014 and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people and as one gathereth eggs that are left have i gathered all the earth and there was none that moved the wing or opened the mouth or peeped 1015 shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up or as if the staff should lift up itself as if it were no wood 1016 therefore shall the lord the lord of hosts send among his fat ones leanness and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire 1017 and the light of israel shall be for a fire and his holy one for a flame and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day 1018 and shall consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field both soul and body and they shall be as when a standardbearer fainteth 1019 and the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few that a child may write them 1020 and it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of israel and such as are escaped of the house of jacob shall no more again stay upon him that smote them but shall stay upon the lord the holy one of israel in truth 1021 the remnant shall return even the remnant of jacob unto the mighty god 1022 for though thy people israel be as the sand of the sea yet a remnant of them shall return the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness 1023 for the lord god of hosts shall make a consumption even determined in the midst of all the land 1024 therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts o my people that dwellest in zion be not afraid of the assyrian he shall smite thee with a rod and shall lift up his staff against thee after the manner of egypt 1025 for yet a very little while and the indignation shall cease and mine anger in their destruction 1026 and the lord of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him according to the slaughter of midian at the rock of oreb and as his rod was upon the sea so shall he lift it up after the manner of egypt 1027 and it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing 1028 he is come to aiath he is passed to migron at michmash he hath laid up his carriages 1029 they are gone over the passage they have taken up their lodging at geba ramah is afraid gibeah of saul is fled 1030 lift up thy voice o daughter of gallim cause it to be heard unto laish o poor anathoth 1031 madmenah is removed the inhabitants of gebim gather themselves to flee 1032 as yet shall he remain at nob that day he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of zion the hill of jerusalem 1033 behold the lord the lord of hosts shall lop the bough with terror and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down and the haughty shall be humbled 1034 and he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron and lebanon shall fall by a mighty one 111 and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots 112 and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord 113 and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears 114 but with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked 115 and righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins and faithfulness the girdle of his reins 116 the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb and the leopard shall lie down with the kid and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together and a little child shall lead them 117 and the cow and the bear shall feed their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw like the ox 118 and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice den 119 they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea 1110 and in that day there shall be a root of jesse which shall stand for an ensign of the people to it shall the gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious 1111 and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people which shall be left from assyria and from egypt and from pathros and from cush and from elam and from shinar and from hamath and from the islands of the sea 1112 and he shall set up an ensign for the nations and shall assemble the outcasts of israel and gather together the dispersed of judah from the four corners of the earth 1113 the envy also of ephraim shall depart and the adversaries of judah shall be cut off ephraim shall not envy judah and judah shall not vex ephraim 1114 but they shall fly upon the shoulders of the philistines toward the west they shall spoil them of the east together they shall lay their hand upon edom and moab and the children of ammon shall obey them 1115 and the lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the egyptian sea and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the river and shall smite it in the seven streams and make men go over dryshod 1116 and there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people which shall be left from assyria like as it was to israel in the day that he came up out of the land of egypt 121 and in that day thou shalt say o lord i will praise thee though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away and thou comfortedst me 122 behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also is become my salvation 123 therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation 124 and in that day shall ye say praise the lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted 125 sing unto the lord for he hath done excellent things this is known in all the earth 126 cry out and shout thou inhabitant of zion for great is the holy one of israel in the midst of thee 131 the burden of babylon which isaiah the son of amoz did see 132 lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain exalt the voice unto them shake the hand that they may go into the gates of the nobles 133 i have commanded my sanctified ones i have also called my mighty ones for mine anger even them that rejoice in my highness 134 the noise of a multitude in the mountains like as of a great people a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together the lord of hosts mustereth the host of the battle 135 they come from a far country from the end of heaven even the lord and the weapons of his indignation to destroy the whole land 136 howl ye for the day of the lord is at hand it shall come as a destruction from the almighty 137 therefore shall all hands be faint and every mans heart shall melt 138 and they shall be afraid pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth they shall be amazed one at another their faces shall be as flames 139 behold the day of the lord cometh cruel both with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it 1310 for the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light the sun shall be darkened in his going forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shine 1311 and i will punish the world for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and i will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible 1312 i will make a man more precious than fine gold even a man than the golden wedge of ophir 1313 therefore i will shake the heavens and the earth shall remove out of her place in the wrath of the lord of hosts and in the day of his fierce anger 1314 and it shall be as the chased roe and as a sheep that no man taketh up they shall every man turn to his own people and flee every one into his own land 1315 every one that is found shall be thrust through and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword 1316 their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished 1317 behold i will stir up the medes against them which shall not regard silver and as for gold they shall not delight in it 1318 their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb their eyes shall not spare children 1319 and babylon the glory of kingdoms the beauty of the chaldees excellency shall be as when god overthrew sodom and gomorrah 1320 it shall never be inhabited neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation neither shall the arabian pitch tent there neither shall the shepherds make their fold there 1321 but wild beasts of the desert shall lie there and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures and owls shall dwell there and satyrs shall dance there 1322 and the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses and dragons in their pleasant palaces and her time is near to come and her days shall not be prolonged 141 for the lord will have mercy on jacob and will yet choose israel and set them in their own land and the strangers shall be joined with them and they shall cleave to the house of jacob 142 and the people shall take them and bring them to their place and the house of israel shall possess them in the land of the lord for servants and handmaids and they shall take them captives whose captives they were and they shall rule over their oppressors 143 and it shall come to pass in the day that the lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and from thy fear and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve 144 that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of babylon and say how hath the oppressor ceased the golden city ceased 145 the lord hath broken the staff of the wicked and the sceptre of the rulers 146 he who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke he that ruled the nations in anger is persecuted and none hindereth 147 the whole earth is at rest and is quiet they break forth into singing 148 yea the fir trees rejoice at thee and the cedars of lebanon saying since thou art laid down no feller is come up against us 149 hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming it stirreth up the dead for thee even all the chief ones of the earth it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations 1410 all they shall speak and say unto thee art thou also become weak as we art thou become like unto us 1411 thy pomp is brought down to the grave and the noise of thy viols the worm is spread under thee and the worms cover thee 1412 how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which didst weaken the nations 1413 for thou hast said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north 1414 i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high 1415 yet thou shalt be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit 1416 they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms 1417 that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners 1418 all the kings of the nations even all of them lie in glory every one in his own house 1419 but thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch and as the raiment of those that are slain thrust through with a sword that go down to the stones of the pit as a carcase trodden under feet 1420 thou shalt not be joined with them in burial because thou hast destroyed thy land and slain thy people the seed of evildoers shall never be renowned 1421 prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their fathers that they do not rise nor possess the land nor fill the face of the world with cities 1422 for i will rise up against them saith the lord of hosts and cut off from babylon the name and remnant and son and nephew saith the lord 1423 i will also make it a possession for the bittern and pools of water and i will sweep it with the besom of destruction saith the lord of hosts 1424 the lord of hosts hath sworn saying surely as i have thought so shall it come to pass and as i have purposed so shall it stand 1425 that i will break the assyrian in my land and upon my mountains tread him under foot then shall his yoke depart from off them and his burden depart from off their shoulders 1426 this is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations 1427 for the lord of hosts hath purposed and who shall disannul it and his hand is stretched out and who shall turn it back 1428 in the year that king ahaz died was this burden 1429 rejoice not thou whole palestina because the rod of him that smote thee is broken for out of the serpents root shall come forth a cockatrice and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent 1430 and the firstborn of the poor shall feed and the needy shall lie down in safety and i will kill thy root with famine and he shall slay thy remnant 1431 howl o gate cry o city thou whole palestina art dissolved for there shall come from the north a smoke and none shall be alone in his appointed times 1432 what shall one then answer the messengers of the nation that the lord hath founded zion and the poor of his people shall trust in it 151 the burden of moab because in the night ar of moab is laid waste and brought to silence because in the night kir of moab is laid waste and brought to silence 152 he is gone up to bajith and to dibon the high places to weep moab shall howl over nebo and over medeba on all their heads shall be baldness and every beard cut off 153 in their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth on the tops of their houses and in their streets every one shall howl weeping abundantly 154 and heshbon shall cry and elealeh their voice shall be heard even unto jahaz therefore the armed soldiers of moab shall cry out his life shall be grievous unto him 155 my heart shall cry out for moab his fugitives shall flee unto zoar an heifer of three years old for by the mounting up of luhith with weeping shall they go it up for in the way of horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction 156 for the waters of nimrim shall be desolate for the hay is withered away the grass faileth there is no green thing 157 therefore the abundance they have gotten and that which they have laid up shall they carry away to the brook of the willows 158 for the cry is gone round about the borders of moab the howling thereof unto eglaim and the howling thereof unto beerelim 159 for the waters of dimon shall be full of blood for i will bring more upon dimon lions upon him that escapeth of moab and upon the remnant of the land 161 send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from sela to the wilderness unto the mount of the daughter of zion 162 for it shall be that as a wandering bird cast out of the nest so the daughters of moab shall be at the fords of arnon 163 take counsel execute judgment make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday hide the outcasts bewray not him that wandereth 164 let mine outcasts dwell with thee moab be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler for the extortioner is at an end the spoiler ceaseth the oppressors are consumed out of the land 165 and in mercy shall the throne be established and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of david judging and seeking judgment and hasting righteousness 166 we have heard of the pride of moab he is very proud even of his haughtiness and his pride and his wrath but his lies shall not be so 167 therefore shall moab howl for moab every one shall howl for the foundations of kirhareseth shall ye mourn surely they are stricken 168 for the fields of heshbon languish and the vine of sibmah the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants thereof they are come even unto jazer they wandered through the wilderness her branches are stretched out they are gone over the sea 169 therefore i will bewail with the weeping of jazer the vine of sibmah i will water thee with my tears o heshbon and elealeh for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy harvest is fallen 1610 and gladness is taken away and joy out of the plentiful field and in the vineyards there shall be no singing neither shall there be shouting the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses i have made their vintage shouting to cease 1611 wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for moab and mine inward parts for kirharesh 1612 and it shall come to pass when it is seen that moab is weary on the high place that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray but he shall not prevail 1613 this is the word that the lord hath spoken concerning moab since that time 1614 but now the lord hath spoken saying within three years as the years of an hireling and the glory of moab shall be contemned with all that great multitude and the remnant shall be very small and feeble 171 the burden of damascus behold damascus is taken away from being a city and it shall be a ruinous heap 172 the cities of aroer are forsaken they shall be for flocks which shall lie down and none shall make them afraid 173 the fortress also shall cease from ephraim and the kingdom from damascus and the remnant of syria they shall be as the glory of the children of israel saith the lord of hosts 174 and in that day it shall come to pass that the glory of jacob shall be made thin and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean 175 and it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn and reapeth the ears with his arm and it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of rephaim 176 yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it as the shaking of an olive tree two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof saith the lord god of israel 177 at that day shall a man look to his maker and his eyes shall have respect to the holy one of israel 178 and he shall not look to the altars the work of his hands neither shall respect that which his fingers have made either the groves or the images 179 in that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough and an uppermost branch which they left because of the children of israel and there shall be desolation 1710 because thou hast forgotten the god of thy salvation and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants and shalt set it with strange slips 1711 in the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow 1712 woe to the multitude of many people which make a noise like the noise of the seas and to the rushing of nations that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters 1713 the nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters but god shall rebuke them and they shall flee far off and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind 1714 and behold at eveningtide trouble and before the morning he is not this is the portion of them that spoil us and the lot of them that rob us 181 woe to the land shadowing with wings which is beyond the rivers of ethiopia 182 that sendeth ambassadors by the sea even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters saying go ye swift messengers to a nation scattered and peeled to a people terrible from their beginning hitherto a nation meted out and trodden down whose land the rivers have spoiled 183 all ye inhabitants of the world and dwellers on the earth see ye when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains and when he bloweth a trumpet hear ye 184 for so the lord said unto me i will take my rest and i will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest 185 for afore the harvest when the bud is perfect and the sour grape is ripening in the flower he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks and take away and cut down the branches 186 they shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth and the fowls shall summer upon them and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them 187 in that time shall the present be brought unto the lord of hosts of a people scattered and peeled and from a people terrible from their beginning hitherto a nation meted out and trodden under foot whose land the rivers have spoiled to the place of the name of the lord of hosts the mount zion 191 the burden of egypt behold the lord rideth upon a swift cloud and shall come into egypt and the idols of egypt shall be moved at his presence and the heart of egypt shall melt in the midst of it 192 and i will set the egyptians against the egyptians and they shall fight every one against his brother and every one against his neighbour city against city and kingdom against kingdom 193 and the spirit of egypt shall fail in the midst thereof and i will destroy the counsel thereof and they shall seek to the idols and to the charmers and to them that have familiar spirits and to the wizards 194 and the egyptians will i give over into the hand of a cruel lord and a fierce king shall rule over them saith the lord the lord of hosts 195 and the waters shall fail from the sea and the river shall be wasted and dried up 196 and they shall turn the rivers far away and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up the reeds and flags shall wither 197 the paper reeds by the brooks by the mouth of the brooks and every thing sown by the brooks shall wither be driven away and be no more 198 the fishers also shall mourn and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish 199 moreover they that work in fine flax and they that weave networks shall be confounded 1910 and they shall be broken in the purposes thereof all that make sluices and ponds for fish 1911 surely the princes of zoan are fools the counsel of the wise counsellors of pharaoh is become brutish how say ye unto pharaoh i am the son of the wise the son of ancient kings 1912 where are they where are thy wise men and let them tell thee now and let them know what the lord of hosts hath purposed upon egypt 1913 the princes of zoan are become fools the princes of noph are deceived they have also seduced egypt even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof 1914 the lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof and they have caused egypt to err in every work thereof as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit 1915 neither shall there be any work for egypt which the head or tail branch or rush may do 1916 in that day shall egypt be like unto women and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the lord of hosts which he shaketh over it 1917 and the land of judah shall be a terror unto egypt every one that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself because of the counsel of the lord of hosts which he hath determined against it 1918 in that day shall five cities in the land of egypt speak the language of canaan and swear to the lord of hosts one shall be called the city of destruction 1919 in that day shall there be an altar to the lord in the midst of the land of egypt and a pillar at the border thereof to the lord 1920 and it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the lord of hosts in the land of egypt for they shall cry unto the lord because of the oppressors and he shall send them a saviour and a great one and he shall deliver them 1921 and the lord shall be known to egypt and the egyptians shall know the lord in that day and shall do sacrifice and oblation yea they shall vow a vow unto the lord and perform it 1922 and the lord shall smite egypt he shall smite and heal it and they shall return even to the lord and he shall be intreated of them and shall heal them 1923 in that day shall there be a highway out of egypt to assyria and the assyrian shall come into egypt and the egyptian into assyria and the egyptians shall serve with the assyrians 1924 in that day shall israel be the third with egypt and with assyria even a blessing in the midst of the land 1925 whom the lord of hosts shall bless saying blessed be egypt my people and assyria the work of my hands and israel mine inheritance 201 in the year that tartan came unto ashdod when sargon the king of assyria sent him and fought against ashdod and took it 202 at the same time spake the lord by isaiah the son of amoz saying go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins and put off thy shoe from thy foot and he did so walking naked and barefoot 203 and the lord said like as my servant isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon egypt and upon ethiopia 204 so shall the king of assyria lead away the egyptians prisoners and the ethiopians captives young and old naked and barefoot even with their buttocks uncovered to the shame of egypt 205 and they shall be afraid and ashamed of ethiopia their expectation and of egypt their glory 206 and the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day behold such is our expectation whither we flee for help to be delivered from the king of assyria and how shall we escape 211 the burden of the desert of the sea as whirlwinds in the south pass through so it cometh from the desert from a terrible land 212 a grievous vision is declared unto me the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously and the spoiler spoileth go up o elam besiege o media all the sighing thereof have i made to cease 213 therefore are my loins filled with pain pangs have taken hold upon me as the pangs of a woman that travaileth i was bowed down at the hearing of it i was dismayed at the seeing of it 214 my heart panted fearfulness affrighted me the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me 215 prepare the table watch in the watchtower eat drink arise ye princes and anoint the shield 216 for thus hath the lord said unto me go set a watchman let him declare what he seeth 217 and he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen a chariot of asses and a chariot of camels and he hearkened diligently with much heed 218 and he cried a lion my lord i stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime and i am set in my ward whole nights 219 and behold here cometh a chariot of men with a couple of horsemen and he answered and said babylon is fallen is fallen and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground 2110 o my threshing and the corn of my floor that which i have heard of the lord of hosts the god of israel have i declared unto you 2111 the burden of dumah he calleth to me out of seir watchman what of the night watchman what of the night 2112 the watchman said the morning cometh and also the night if ye will enquire enquire ye return come 2113 the burden upon arabia in the forest in arabia shall ye lodge o ye travelling companies of dedanim 2114 the inhabitants of the land of tema brought water to him that was thirsty they prevented with their bread him that fled 2115 for they fled from the swords from the drawn sword and from the bent bow and from the grievousness of war 2116 for thus hath the lord said unto me within a year according to the years of an hireling and all the glory of kedar shall fail 2117 and the residue of the number of archers the mighty men of the children of kedar shall be diminished for the lord god of israel hath spoken it 221 the burden of the valley of vision what aileth thee now that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops 222 thou that art full of stirs a tumultuous city joyous city thy slain men are not slain with the sword nor dead in battle 223 all thy rulers are fled together they are bound by the archers all that are found in thee are bound together which have fled from far 224 therefore said i look away from me i will weep bitterly labour not to comfort me because of the spoiling of the daughter of my people 225 for it is a day of trouble and of treading down and of perplexity by the lord god of hosts in the valley of vision breaking down the walls and of crying to the mountains 226 and elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen and kir uncovered the shield 227 and it shall come to pass that thy choicest valleys shall be full of chariots and the horsemen shall set themselves in array at the gate 228 and he discovered the covering of judah and thou didst look in that day to the armour of the house of the forest 229 ye have seen also the breaches of the city of david that they are many and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool 2210 and ye have numbered the houses of jerusalem and the houses have ye broken down to fortify the wall 2211 ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of the old pool but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago 2212 and in that day did the lord god of hosts call to weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth 2213 and behold joy and gladness slaying oxen and killing sheep eating flesh and drinking wine let us eat and drink for to morrow we shall die 2214 and it was revealed in mine ears by the lord of hosts surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die saith the lord god of hosts 2215 thus saith the lord god of hosts go get thee unto this treasurer even unto shebna which is over the house and say 2216 what hast thou here and whom hast thou here that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here as he that heweth him out a sepulchre on high and that graveth an habitation for himself in a rock 2217 behold the lord will carry thee away with a mighty captivity and will surely cover thee 2218 he will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country there shalt thou die and there the chariots of thy glory shall be the shame of thy lords house 2219 and i will drive thee from thy station and from thy state shall he pull thee down 2220 and it shall come to pass in that day that i will call my servant eliakim the son of hilkiah 2221 and i will clothe him with thy robe and strengthen him with thy girdle and i will commit thy government into his hand and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of jerusalem and to the house of judah 2222 and the key of the house of david will i lay upon his shoulder so he shall open and none shall shut and he shall shut and none shall open 2223 and i will fasten him as a nail in a sure place and he shall be for a glorious throne to his fathers house 2224 and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his fathers house the offspring and the issue all vessels of small quantity from the vessels of cups even to all the vessels of flagons 2225 in that day saith the lord of hosts shall the nail that is fastened in the sure place be removed and be cut down and fall and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off for the lord hath spoken it 231 the burden of tyre howl ye ships of tarshish for it is laid waste so that there is no house no entering in from the land of chittim it is revealed to them 232 be still ye inhabitants of the isle thou whom the merchants of zidon that pass over the sea have replenished 233 and by great waters the seed of sihor the harvest of the river is her revenue and she is a mart of nations 234 be thou ashamed o zidon for the sea hath spoken even the strength of the sea saying i travail not nor bring forth children neither do i nourish up young men nor bring up virgins 235 as at the report concerning egypt so shall they be sorely pained at the report of tyre 236 pass ye over to tarshish howl ye inhabitants of the isle 237 is this your joyous city whose antiquity is of ancient days her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn 238 who hath taken this counsel against tyre the crowning city whose merchants are princes whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth 239 the lord of hosts hath purposed it to stain the pride of all glory and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the earth 2310 pass through thy land as a river o daughter of tarshish there is no more strength 2311 he stretched out his hand over the sea he shook the kingdoms the lord hath given a commandment against the merchant city to destroy the strong holds thereof 2312 and he said thou shalt no more rejoice o thou oppressed virgin daughter of zidon arise pass over to chittim there also shalt thou have no rest 2313 behold the land of the chaldeans this people was not till the assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness they set up the towers thereof they raised up the palaces thereof and he brought it to ruin 2314 howl ye ships of tarshish for your strength is laid waste 2315 and it shall come to pass in that day that tyre shall be forgotten seventy years according to the days of one king after the end of seventy years shall tyre sing as an harlot 2316 take an harp go about the city thou harlot that hast been forgotten make sweet melody sing many songs that thou mayest be remembered 2317 and it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years that the lord will visit tyre and she shall turn to her hire and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world upon the face of the earth 2318 and her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the lord it shall not be treasured nor laid up for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the lord to eat sufficiently and for durable clothing 241 behold the lord maketh the earth empty and maketh it waste and turneth it upside down and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof 242 and it shall be as with the people so with the priest as with the servant so with his master as with the maid so with her mistress as with the buyer so with the seller as with the lender so with the borrower as with the taker of usury so with the giver of usury to him 243 the land shall be utterly emptied and utterly spoiled for the lord hath spoken this word 244 the earth mourneth and fadeth away the world languisheth and fadeth away the haughty people of the earth do languish 245 the earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof because they have transgressed the laws changed the ordinance broken the everlasting covenant 246 therefore hath the curse devoured the earth and they that dwell therein are desolate therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned and few men left 247 the new wine mourneth the vine languisheth all the merryhearted do sigh 248 the mirth of tabrets ceaseth the noise of them that rejoice endeth the joy of the harp ceaseth 249 they shall not drink wine with a song strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it 2410 the city of confusion is broken down every house is shut up that no man may come in 2411 there is a crying for wine in the streets all joy is darkened the mirth of the land is gone 2412 in the city is left desolation and the gate is smitten with destruction 2413 when thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the people there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree and as the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done 2414 they shall lift up their voice they shall sing for the majesty of the lord they shall cry aloud from the sea 2415 wherefore glorify ye the lord in the fires even the name of the lord god of israel in the isles of the sea 2416 from the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs even glory to the righteous but i said my leanness my leanness woe unto me the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously yea the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously 2417 fear and the pit and the snare are upon thee o inhabitant of the earth 2418 and it shall come to pass that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare for the windows from on high are open and the foundations of the earth do shake 2419 the earth is utterly broken down the earth is clean dissolved the earth is moved exceedingly 2420 the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard and shall be removed like a cottage and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it and it shall fall and not rise again 2421 and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high and the kings of the earth upon the earth 2422 and they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit and shall be shut up in the prison and after many days shall they be visited 2423 then the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed when the lord of hosts shall reign in mount zion and in jerusalem and before his ancients gloriously 251 o lord thou art my god i will exalt thee i will praise thy name for thou hast done wonderful things thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth 252 for thou hast made of a city an heap of a defenced city a ruin a palace of strangers to be no city it shall never be built 253 therefore shall the strong people glorify thee the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee 254 for thou hast been a strength to the poor a strength to the needy in his distress a refuge from the storm a shadow from the heat when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall 255 thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers as the heat in a dry place even the heat with the shadow of a cloud the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low 256 and in this mountain shall the lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things a feast of wines on the lees of fat things full of marrow of wines on the lees well refined 257 and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people and the vail that is spread over all nations 258 he will swallow up death in victory and the lord god will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth for the lord hath spoken it 259 and it shall be said in that day lo this is our god we have waited for him and he will save us this is the lord we have waited for him we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation 2510 for in this mountain shall the hand of the lord rest and moab shall be trodden down under him even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill 2511 and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands 2512 and the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down lay low and bring to the ground even to the dust 261 in that day shall this song be sung in the land of judah we have a strong city salvation will god appoint for walls and bulwarks 262 open ye the gates that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in 263 thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee 264 trust ye in the lord for ever for in the lord jehovah is everlasting strength 265 for he bringeth down them that dwell on high the lofty city he layeth it low he layeth it low even to the ground he bringeth it even to the dust 266 the foot shall tread it down even the feet of the poor and the steps of the needy 267 the way of the just is uprightness thou most upright dost weigh the path of the just 268 yea in the way of thy judgments o lord have we waited for thee the desire of our soul is to thy name and to the remembrance of thee 269 with my soul have i desired thee in the night yea with my spirit within me will i seek thee early for when thy judgments are in the earth the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness 2610 let favour be shewed to the wicked yet will he not learn righteousness in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly and will not behold the majesty of the lord 2611 lord when thy hand is lifted up they will not see but they shall see and be ashamed for their envy at the people yea the fire of thine enemies shall devour them 2612 lord thou wilt ordain peace for us for thou also hast wrought all our works in us 2613 o lord our god other lords beside thee have had dominion over us but by thee only will we make mention of thy name 2614 they are dead they shall not live they are deceased they shall not rise therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them and made all their memory to perish 2615 thou hast increased the nation o lord thou hast increased the nation thou art glorified thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth 2616 lord in trouble have they visited thee they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them 2617 like as a woman with child that draweth near the time of her delivery is in pain and crieth out in her pangs so have we been in thy sight o lord 2618 we have been with child we have been in pain we have as it were brought forth wind we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen 2619 thy dead men shall live together with my dead body shall they arise awake and sing ye that dwell in dust for thy dew is as the dew of herbs and the earth shall cast out the dead 2620 come my people enter thou into thy chambers and shut thy doors about thee hide thyself as it were for a little moment until the indignation be overpast 2621 for behold the lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity the earth also shall disclose her blood and shall no more cover her slain 271 in that day the lord with his sore and great and strong sword shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent even leviathan that crooked serpent and he shall slay the dragon that is in the sea 272 in that day sing ye unto her a vineyard of red wine 273 i the lord do keep it i will water it every moment lest any hurt it i will keep it night and day 274 fury is not in me who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle i would go through them i would burn them together 275 or let him take hold of my strength that he may make peace with me and he shall make peace with me 276 he shall cause them that come of jacob to take root israel shall blossom and bud and fill the face of the world with fruit 277 hath he smitten him as he smote those that smote him or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by him 278 in measure when it shooteth forth thou wilt debate with it he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind 279 by this therefore shall the iniquity of jacob be purged and this is all the fruit to take away his sin when he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder the groves and images shall not stand up 2710 yet the defenced city shall be desolate and the habitation forsaken and left like a wilderness there shall the calf feed and there shall he lie down and consume the branches thereof 2711 when the boughs thereof are withered they shall be broken off the women come and set them on fire for it is a people of no understanding therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them and he that formed them will shew them no favour 2712 and it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of egypt and ye shall be gathered one by one o ye children of israel 2713 and it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet shall be blown and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of assyria and the outcasts in the land of egypt and shall worship the lord in the holy mount at jerusalem 281 woe to the crown of pride to the drunkards of ephraim whose glorious beauty is a fading flower which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine 282 behold the lord hath a mighty and strong one which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm as a flood of mighty waters overflowing shall cast down to the earth with the hand 283 the crown of pride the drunkards of ephraim shall be trodden under feet 284 and the glorious beauty which is on the head of the fat valley shall be a fading flower and as the hasty fruit before the summer which when he that looketh upon it seeth while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up 285 in that day shall the lord of hosts be for a crown of glory and for a diadem of beauty unto the residue of his people 286 and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate 287 but they also have erred through wine and through strong drink are out of the way the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink they are swallowed up of wine they are out of the way through strong drink they err in vision they stumble in judgment 288 for all tables are full of vomit and filthiness so that there is no place clean 289 whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts 2810 for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little 2811 for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people 2812 to whom he said this is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing yet they would not hear 2813 but the word of the lord was unto them precept upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line here a little and there a little that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken 2814 wherefore hear the word of the lord ye scornful men that rule this people which is in jerusalem 2815 because ye have said we have made a covenant with death and with hell are we at agreement when the overflowing scourge shall pass through it shall not come unto us for we have made lies our refuge and under falsehood have we hid ourselves 2816 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i lay in zion for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious corner stone a sure foundation he that believeth shall not make haste 2817 judgment also will i lay to the line and righteousness to the plummet and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies and the waters shall overflow the hiding place 2818 and your covenant with death shall be disannulled and your agreement with hell shall not stand when the overflowing scourge shall pass through then ye shall be trodden down by it 2819 from the time that it goeth forth it shall take you for morning by morning shall it pass over by day and by night and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report 2820 for the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it 2821 for the lord shall rise up as in mount perazim he shall be wroth as in the valley of gibeon that he may do his work his strange work and bring to pass his act his strange act 2822 now therefore be ye not mockers lest your bands be made strong for i have heard from the lord god of hosts a consumption even determined upon the whole earth 2823 give ye ear and hear my voice hearken and hear my speech 2824 doth the plowman plow all day to sow doth he open and break the clods of his ground 2825 when he hath made plain the face thereof doth he not cast abroad the fitches and scatter the cummin and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place 2826 for his god doth instruct him to discretion and doth teach him 2827 for the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin but the fitches are beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rod 2828 bread corn is bruised because he will not ever be threshing it nor break it with the wheel of his cart nor bruise it with his horsemen 2829 this also cometh forth from the lord of hosts which is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working 291 woe to ariel to ariel the city where david dwelt add ye year to year let them kill sacrifices 292 yet i will distress ariel and there shall be heaviness and sorrow and it shall be unto me as ariel 293 and i will camp against thee round about and will lay siege against thee with a mount and i will raise forts against thee 294 and thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of the ground and thy speech shall be low out of the dust and thy voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit out of the ground and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust 295 moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small dust and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passeth away yea it shall be at an instant suddenly 296 thou shalt be visited of the lord of hosts with thunder and with earthquake and great noise with storm and tempest and the flame of devouring fire 297 and the multitude of all the nations that fight against ariel even all that fight against her and her munition and that distress her shall be as a dream of a night vision 298 it shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth and behold he eateth but he awaketh and his soul is empty or as when a thirsty man dreameth and behold he drinketh but he awaketh and behold he is faint and his soul hath appetite so shall the multitude of all the nations be that fight against mount zion 299 stay yourselves and wonder cry ye out and cry they are drunken but not with wine they stagger but not with strong drink 2910 for the lord hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep and hath closed your eyes the prophets and your rulers the seers hath he covered 2911 and the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a book that is sealed which men deliver to one that is learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i cannot for it is sealed 2912 and the book is delivered to him that is not learned saying read this i pray thee and he saith i am not learned 2913 wherefore the lord said forasmuch as this people draw near me with their mouth and with their lips do honour me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men 2914 therefore behold i will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people even a marvellous work and a wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid 2915 woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the lord and their works are in the dark and they say who seeth us and who knoweth us 2916 surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potters clay for shall the work say of him that made it he made me not or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it he had no understanding 2917 is it not yet a very little while and lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest 2918 and in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness 2919 the meek also shall increase their joy in the lord and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy one of israel 2920 for the terrible one is brought to nought and the scorner is consumed and all that watch for iniquity are cut off 2921 that make a man an offender for a word and lay a snare for him that reproveth in the gate and turn aside the just for a thing of nought 2922 therefore thus saith the lord who redeemed abraham concerning the house of jacob jacob shall not now be ashamed neither shall his face now wax pale 2923 but when he seeth his children the work of mine hands in the midst of him they shall sanctify my name and sanctify the holy one of jacob and shall fear the god of israel 2924 they also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding and they that murmured shall learn doctrine 301 woe to the rebellious children saith the lord that take counsel but not of me and that cover with a covering but not of my spirit that they may add sin to sin 302 that walk to go down into egypt and have not asked at my mouth to strengthen themselves in the strength of pharaoh and to trust in the shadow of egypt 303 therefore shall the strength of pharaoh be your shame and the trust in the shadow of egypt your confusion 304 for his princes were at zoan and his ambassadors came to hanes 305 they were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them nor be an help nor profit but a shame and also a reproach 306 the burden of the beasts of the south into the land of trouble and anguish from whence come the young and old lion the viper and fiery flying serpent they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses and their treasures upon the bunches of camels to a people that shall not profit them 307 for the egyptians shall help in vain and to no purpose therefore have i cried concerning this their strength is to sit still 308 now go write it before them in a table and note it in a book that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever 309 that this is a rebellious people lying children children that will not hear the law of the lord 3010 which say to the seers see not and to the prophets prophesy not unto us right things speak unto us smooth things prophesy deceits 3011 get you out of the way turn aside out of the path cause the holy one of israel to cease from before us 3012 wherefore thus saith the holy one of israel because ye despise this word and trust in oppression and perverseness and stay thereon 3013 therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall swelling out in a high wall whose breaking cometh suddenly at an instant 3014 and he shall break it as the breaking of the potters vessel that is broken in pieces he shall not spare so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth or to take water withal out of the pit 3015 for thus saith the lord god the holy one of israel in returning and rest shall ye be saved in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength and ye would not 3016 but ye said no for we will flee upon horses therefore shall ye flee and we will ride upon the swift therefore shall they that pursue you be swift 3017 one thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one at the rebuke of five shall ye flee till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain and as an ensign on an hill 3018 and therefore will the lord wait that he may be gracious unto you and therefore will he be exalted that he may have mercy upon you for the lord is a god of judgment blessed are all they that wait for him 3019 for the people shall dwell in zion at jerusalem thou shalt weep no more he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy cry when he shall hear it he will answer thee 3020 and though the lord give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner any more but thine eyes shall see thy teachers 3021 and thine ears shall hear a word behind thee saying this is the way walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand and when ye turn to the left 3022 ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver and the ornament of thy molten images of gold thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth thou shalt say unto it get thee hence 3023 then shall he give the rain of thy seed that thou shalt sow the ground withal and bread of the increase of the earth and it shall be fat and plenteous in that day shall thy cattle feed in large pastures 3024 the oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall eat clean provender which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan 3025 and there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every high hill rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter when the towers fall 3026 moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days in the day that the lord bindeth up the breach of his people and healeth the stroke of their wound 3027 behold the name of the lord cometh from far burning with his anger and the burden thereof is heavy his lips are full of indignation and his tongue as a devouring fire 3028 and his breath as an overflowing stream shall reach to the midst of the neck to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people causing them to err 3029 ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept and gladness of heart as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the lord to the mighty one of israel 3030 and the lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard and shall shew the lighting down of his arm with the indignation of his anger and with the flame of a devouring fire with scattering and tempest and hailstones 3031 for through the voice of the lord shall the assyrian be beaten down which smote with a rod 3032 and in every place where the grounded staff shall pass which the lord shall lay upon him it shall be with tabrets and harps and in battles of shaking will he fight with it 3033 for tophet is ordained of old yea for the king it is prepared he hath made it deep and large the pile thereof is fire and much wood the breath of the lord like a stream of brimstone doth kindle it 311 woe to them that go down to egypt for help and stay on horses and trust in chariots because they are many and in horsemen because they are very strong but they look not unto the holy one of israel neither seek the lord 312 yet he also is wise and will bring evil and will not call back his words but will arise against the house of the evildoers and against the help of them that work iniquity 313 now the egyptians are men and not god and their horses flesh and not spirit when the lord shall stretch out his hand both he that helpeth shall fall and he that is holpen shall fall down and they all shall fail together 314 for thus hath the lord spoken unto me like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him he will not be afraid of their voice nor abase himself for the noise of them so shall the lord of hosts come down to fight for mount zion and for the hill thereof 315 as birds flying so will the lord of hosts defend jerusalem defending also he will deliver it and passing over he will preserve it 316 turn ye unto him from whom the children of israel have deeply revolted 317 for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver and his idols of gold which your own hands have made unto you for a sin 318 then shall the assyrian fall with the sword not of a mighty man and the sword not of a mean man shall devour him but he shall flee from the sword and his young men shall be discomfited 319 and he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear and his princes shall be afraid of the ensign saith the lord whose fire is in zion and his furnace in jerusalem 321 behold a king shall reign in righteousness and princes shall rule in judgment 322 and a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind and a covert from the tempest as rivers of water in a dry place as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land 323 and the eyes of them that see shall not be dim and the ears of them that hear shall hearken 324 the heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly 325 the vile person shall be no more called liberal nor the churl said to be bountiful 326 for the vile person will speak villany and his heart will work iniquity to practise hypocrisy and to utter error against the lord to make empty the soul of the hungry and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail 327 the instruments also of the churl are evil he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the poor with lying words even when the needy speaketh right 328 but the liberal deviseth liberal things and by liberal things shall he stand 329 rise up ye women that are at ease hear my voice ye careless daughters give ear unto my speech 3210 many days and years shall ye be troubled ye careless women for the vintage shall fail the gathering shall not come 3211 tremble ye women that are at ease be troubled ye careless ones strip you and make you bare and gird sackcloth upon your loins 3212 they shall lament for the teats for the pleasant fields for the fruitful vine 3213 upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers yea upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city 3214 because the palaces shall be forsaken the multitude of the city shall be left the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever a joy of wild asses a pasture of flocks 3215 until the spirit be poured upon us from on high and the wilderness be a fruitful field and the fruitful field be counted for a forest 3216 then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness and righteousness remain in the fruitful field 3217 and the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever 3218 and my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation and in sure dwellings and in quiet resting places 3219 when it shall hail coming down on the forest and the city shall be low in a low place 3220 blessed are ye that sow beside all waters that send forth thither the feet of the ox and the ass 331 woe to thee that spoilest and thou wast not spoiled and dealest treacherously and they dealt not treacherously with thee when thou shalt cease to spoil thou shalt be spoiled and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously they shall deal treacherously with thee 332 o lord be gracious unto us we have waited for thee be thou their arm every morning our salvation also in the time of trouble 333 at the noise of the tumult the people fled at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered 334 and your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them 335 the lord is exalted for he dwelleth on high he hath filled zion with judgment and righteousness 336 and wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation the fear of the lord is his treasure 337 behold their valiant ones shall cry without the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly 338 the highways lie waste the wayfaring man ceaseth he hath broken the covenant he hath despised the cities he regardeth no man 339 the earth mourneth and languisheth lebanon is ashamed and hewn down sharon is like a wilderness and bashan and carmel shake off their fruits 3310 now will i rise saith the lord now will i be exalted now will i lift up myself 3311 ye shall conceive chaff ye shall bring forth stubble your breath as fire shall devour you 3312 and the people shall be as the burnings of lime as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire 3313 hear ye that are far off what i have done and ye that are near acknowledge my might 3314 the sinners in zion are afraid fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings 3315 he that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly he that despiseth the gain of oppressions that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil 3316 he shall dwell on high his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks bread shall be given him his waters shall be sure 3317 thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty they shall behold the land that is very far off 3318 thine heart shall meditate terror where is the scribe where is the receiver where is he that counted the towers 3319 thou shalt not see a fierce people a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive of a stammering tongue that thou canst not understand 3320 look upon zion the city of our solemnities thine eyes shall see jerusalem a quiet habitation a tabernacle that shall not be taken down not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken 3321 but there the glorious lord will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams wherein shall go no galley with oars neither shall gallant ship pass thereby 3322 for the lord is our judge the lord is our lawgiver the lord is our king he will save us 3323 thy tacklings are loosed they could not well strengthen their mast they could not spread the sail then is the prey of a great spoil divided the lame take the prey 3324 and the inhabitant shall not say i am sick the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity 341 come near ye nations to hear and hearken ye people let the earth hear and all that is therein the world and all things that come forth of it 342 for the indignation of the lord is upon all nations and his fury upon all their armies he hath utterly destroyed them he hath delivered them to the slaughter 343 their slain also shall be cast out and their stink shall come up out of their carcases and the mountains shall be melted with their blood 344 and all the host of heaven shall be dissolved and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll and all their host shall fall down as the leaf falleth off from the vine and as a falling fig from the fig tree 345 for my sword shall be bathed in heaven behold it shall come down upon idumea and upon the people of my curse to judgment 346 the sword of the lord is filled with blood it is made fat with fatness and with the blood of lambs and goats with the fat of the kidneys of rams for the lord hath a sacrifice in bozrah and a great slaughter in the land of idumea 347 and the unicorns shall come down with them and the bullocks with the bulls and their land shall be soaked with blood and their dust made fat with fatness 348 for it is the day of the lords vengeance and the year of recompences for the controversy of zion 349 and the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch and the dust thereof into brimstone and the land thereof shall become burning pitch 3410 it shall not be quenched night nor day the smoke thereof shall go up for ever from generation to generation it shall lie waste none shall pass through it for ever and ever 3411 but the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion and the stones of emptiness 3412 they shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom but none shall be there and all her princes shall be nothing 3413 and thorns shall come up in her palaces nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof and it shall be an habitation of dragons and a court for owls 3414 the wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island and the satyr shall cry to his fellow the screech owl also shall rest there and find for herself a place of rest 3415 there shall the great owl make her nest and lay and hatch and gather under her shadow there shall the vultures also be gathered every one with her mate 3416 seek ye out of the book of the lord and read no one of these shall fail none shall want her mate for my mouth it hath commanded and his spirit it hath gathered them 3417 and he hath cast the lot for them and his hand hath divided it unto them by line they shall possess it for ever from generation to generation shall they dwell therein 351 the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose 352 it shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing the glory of lebanon shall be given unto it the excellency of carmel and sharon they shall see the glory of the lord and the excellency of our god 353 strengthen ye the weak hands and confirm the feeble knees 354 say to them that are of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your god will come with vengeance even god with a recompence he will come and save you 355 then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped 356 then shall the lame man leap as an hart and the tongue of the dumb sing for in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desert 357 and the parched ground shall become a pool and the thirsty land springs of water in the habitation of dragons where each lay shall be grass with reeds and rushes 358 and an highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not err therein 359 no lion shall be there nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk there 3510 and the ransomed of the lord shall return and come to zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away 361 now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king hezekiah that sennacherib king of assyria came up against all the defenced cities of judah and took them 362 and the king of assyria sent rabshakeh from lachish to jerusalem unto king hezekiah with a great army and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fullers field 363 then came forth unto him eliakim hilkiahs son which was over the house and shebna the scribe and joah asaphs son the recorder 364 and rabshakeh said unto them say ye now to hezekiah thus saith the great king the king of assyria what confidence is this wherein thou trustest 365 i say sayest thou but they are but vain words i have counsel and strength for war now on whom dost thou trust that thou rebellest against me 366 lo thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed on egypt whereon if a man lean it will go into his hand and pierce it so is pharaoh king of egypt to all that trust in him 367 but if thou say to me we trust in the lord our god is it not he whose high places and whose altars hezekiah hath taken away and said to judah and to jerusalem ye shall worship before this altar 368 now therefore give pledges i pray thee to my master the king of assyria and i will give thee two thousand horses if thou be able on thy part to set riders upon them 369 how then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my masters servants and put thy trust on egypt for chariots and for horsemen 3610 and am i now come up without the lord against this land to destroy it the lord said unto me go up against this land and destroy it 3611 then said eliakim and shebna and joah unto rabshakeh speak i pray thee unto thy servants in the syrian language for we understand it and speak not to us in the jews language in the ears of the people that are on the wall 3612 but rabshakeh said hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words hath he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you 3613 then rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the jews language and said hear ye the words of the great king the king of assyria 3614 thus saith the king let not hezekiah deceive you for he shall not be able to deliver you 3615 neither let hezekiah make you trust in the lord saying the lord will surely deliver us this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of assyria 3616 hearken not to hezekiah for thus saith the king of assyria make an agreement with me by a present and come out to me and eat ye every one of his vine and every one of his fig tree and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern 3617 until i come and take you away to a land like your own land a land of corn and wine a land of bread and vineyards 3618 beware lest hezekiah persuade you saying the lord will deliver us hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of assyria 3619 where are the gods of hamath and arphad where are the gods of sepharvaim and have they delivered samaria out of my hand 3620 who are they among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand that the lord should deliver jerusalem out of my hand 3621 but they held their peace and answered him not a word for the kings commandment was saying answer him not 3622 then came eliakim the son of hilkiah that was over the household and shebna the scribe and joah the son of asaph the recorder to hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of rabshakeh 371 and it came to pass when king hezekiah heard it that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the lord 372 and he sent eliakim who was over the household and shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto isaiah the prophet the son of amoz 373 and they said unto him thus saith hezekiah this day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy for the children are come to the birth and there is not strength to bring forth 374 it may be the lord thy god will hear the words of rabshakeh whom the king of assyria his master hath sent to reproach the living god and will reprove the words which the lord thy god hath heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left 375 so the servants of king hezekiah came to isaiah 376 and isaiah said unto them thus shall ye say unto your master thus saith the lord be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard wherewith the servants of the king of assyria have blasphemed me 377 behold i will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and return to his own land and i will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land 378 so rabshakeh returned and found the king of assyria warring against libnah for he had heard that he was departed from lachish 379 and he heard say concerning tirhakah king of ethiopia he is come forth to make war with thee and when he heard it he sent messengers to hezekiah saying 3710 thus shall ye speak to hezekiah king of judah saying let not thy god in whom thou trustest deceive thee saying jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of assyria 3711 behold thou hast heard what the kings of assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly and shalt thou be delivered 3712 have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed as gozan and haran and rezeph and the children of eden which were in telassar 3713 where is the king of hamath and the king of arphad and the king of the city of sepharvaim hena and ivah 3714 and hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it and hezekiah went up unto the house of the lord and spread it before the lord 3715 and hezekiah prayed unto the lord saying 3716 o lord of hosts god of israel that dwellest between the cherubims thou art the god even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou hast made heaven and earth 3717 incline thine ear o lord and hear open thine eyes o lord and see and hear all the words of sennacherib which hath sent to reproach the living god 3718 of a truth lord the kings of assyria have laid waste all the nations and their countries 3719 and have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the work of mens hands wood and stone therefore they have destroyed them 3720 now therefore o lord our god save us from his hand that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the lord even thou only 3721 then isaiah the son of amoz sent unto hezekiah saying thus saith the lord god of israel whereas thou hast prayed to me against sennacherib king of assyria 3722 this is the word which the lord hath spoken concerning him the virgin the daughter of zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn the daughter of jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee 3723 whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high even against the holy one of israel 3724 by thy servants hast thou reproached the lord and hast said by the multitude of my chariots am i come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of lebanon and i will cut down the tall cedars thereof and the choice fir trees thereof and i will enter into the height of his border and the forest of his carmel 3725 i have digged and drunk water and with the sole of my feet have i dried up all the rivers of the besieged places 3726 hast thou not heard long ago how i have done it and of ancient times that i have formed it now have i brought it to pass that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps 3727 therefore their inhabitants were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field and as the green herb as the grass on the housetops and as corn blasted before it be grown up 3728 but i know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against me 3729 because thy rage against me and thy tumult is come up into mine ears therefore will i put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips and i will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest 3730 and this shall be a sign unto thee ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself and the second year that which springeth of the same and in the third year sow ye and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof 3731 and the remnant that is escaped of the house of judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward 3732 for out of jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and they that escape out of mount zion the zeal of the lord of hosts shall do this 3733 therefore thus saith the lord concerning the king of assyria he shall not come into this city nor shoot an arrow there nor come before it with shields nor cast a bank against it 3734 by the way that he came by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city saith the lord 3735 for i will defend this city to save it for mine own sake and for my servant davids sake 3736 then the angel of the lord went forth and smote in the camp of the assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand and when they arose early in the morning behold they were all dead corpses 3737 so sennacherib king of assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at nineveh 3738 and it came to pass as he was worshipping in the house of nisroch his god that adrammelech and sharezer his sons smote him with the sword and they escaped into the land of armenia and esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead 381 in those days was hezekiah sick unto death and isaiah the prophet the son of amoz came unto him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live 382 then hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed unto the lord 383 and said remember now o lord i beseech thee how i have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart and have done that which is good in thy sight and hezekiah wept sore 384 then came the word of the lord to isaiah saying 385 go and say to hezekiah thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard thy prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will add unto thy days fifteen years 386 and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city 387 and this shall be a sign unto thee from the lord that the lord will do this thing that he hath spoken 388 behold i will bring again the shadow of the degrees which is gone down in the sun dial of ahaz ten degrees backward so the sun returned ten degrees by which degrees it was gone down 389 the writing of hezekiah king of judah when he had been sick and was recovered of his sickness 3810 i said in the cutting off of my days i shall go to the gates of the grave i am deprived of the residue of my years 3811 i said i shall not see the lord even the lord in the land of the living i shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world 3812 mine age is departed and is removed from me as a shepherds tent i have cut off like a weaver my life he will cut me off with pining sickness from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me 3813 i reckoned till morning that as a lion so will he break all my bones from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me 3814 like a crane or a swallow so did i chatter i did mourn as a dove mine eyes fail with looking upward o lord i am oppressed undertake for me 3815 what shall i say he hath both spoken unto me and himself hath done it i shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul 3816 o lord by these things men live and in all these things is the life of my spirit so wilt thou recover me and make me to live 3817 behold for peace i had great bitterness but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back 3818 for the grave cannot praise thee death can not celebrate thee they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth 3819 the living the living he shall praise thee as i do this day the father to the children shall make known thy truth 3820 the lord was ready to save me therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the lord 3821 for isaiah had said let them take a lump of figs and lay it for a plaister upon the boil and he shall recover 3822 hezekiah also had said what is the sign that i shall go up to the house of the lord 391 at that time merodachbaladan the son of baladan king of babylon sent letters and a present to hezekiah for he had heard that he had been sick and was recovered 392 and hezekiah was glad of them and shewed them the house of his precious things the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his armour and all that was found in his treasures there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that hezekiah shewed them not 393 then came isaiah the prophet unto king hezekiah and said unto him what said these men and from whence came they unto thee and hezekiah said they are come from a far country unto me even from babylon 394 then said he what have they seen in thine house and hezekiah answered all that is in mine house have they seen there is nothing among my treasures that i have not shewed them 395 then said isaiah to hezekiah hear the word of the lord of hosts 396 behold the days come that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day shall be carried to babylon nothing shall be left saith the lord 397 and of thy sons that shall issue from thee which thou shalt beget shall they take away and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon 398 then said hezekiah to isaiah good is the word of the lord which thou hast spoken he said moreover for there shall be peace and truth in my days 401 comfort ye comfort ye my people saith your god 402 speak ye comfortably to jerusalem and cry unto her that her warfare is accomplished that her iniquity is pardoned for she hath received of the lords hand double for all her sins 403 the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god 404 every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain 405 and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it 406 the voice said cry and he said what shall i cry all flesh is grass and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field 407 the grass withereth the flower fadeth because the spirit of the lord bloweth upon it surely the people is grass 408 the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of our god shall stand for ever 409 o zion that bringest good tidings get thee up into the high mountain o jerusalem that bringest good tidings lift up thy voice with strength lift it up be not afraid say unto the cities of judah behold your god 4010 behold the lord god will come with strong hand and his arm shall rule for him behold his reward is with him and his work before him 4011 he shall feed his flock like a shepherd he shall gather the lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young 4012 who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and meted out heaven with the span and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure and weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance 4013 who hath directed the spirit of the lord or being his counsellor hath taught him 4014 with whom took he counsel and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and shewed to him the way of understanding 4015 behold the nations are as a drop of a bucket and are counted as the small dust of the balance behold he taketh up the isles as a very little thing 4016 and lebanon is not sufficient to burn nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering 4017 all nations before him are as nothing and they are counted to him less than nothing and vanity 4018 to whom then will ye liken god or what likeness will ye compare unto him 4019 the workman melteth a graven image and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold and casteth silver chains 4020 he that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved 4021 have ye not known have ye not heard hath it not been told you from the beginning have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth 4022 it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in 4023 that bringeth the princes to nothing he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity 4024 yea they shall not be planted yea they shall not be sown yea their stock shall not take root in the earth and he shall also blow upon them and they shall wither and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble 4025 to whom then will ye liken me or shall i be equal saith the holy one 4026 lift up your eyes on high and behold who hath created these things that bringeth out their host by number he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one faileth 4027 why sayest thou o jacob and speakest o israel my way is hid from the lord and my judgment is passed over from my god 4028 hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary there is no searching of his understanding 4029 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increaseth strength 4030 even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall 4031 but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint 411 keep silence before me o islands and let the people renew their strength let them come near then let them speak let us come near together to judgment 412 who raised up the righteous man from the east called him to his foot gave the nations before him and made him rule over kings he gave them as the dust to his sword and as driven stubble to his bow 413 he pursued them and passed safely even by the way that he had not gone with his feet 414 who hath wrought and done it calling the generations from the beginning i the lord the first and with the last i am he 415 the isles saw it and feared the ends of the earth were afraid drew near and came 416 they helped every one his neighbour and every one said to his brother be of good courage 417 so the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith and he that smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil saying it is ready for the sodering and he fastened it with nails that it should not be moved 418 but thou israel art my servant jacob whom i have chosen the seed of abraham my friend 419 thou whom i have taken from the ends of the earth and called thee from the chief men thereof and said unto thee thou art my servant i have chosen thee and not cast thee away 4110 fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness 4111 behold all they that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded they shall be as nothing and they that strive with thee shall perish 4112 thou shalt seek them and shalt not find them even them that contended with thee they that war against thee shall be as nothing and as a thing of nought 4113 for i the lord thy god will hold thy right hand saying unto thee fear not i will help thee 4114 fear not thou worm jacob and ye men of israel i will help thee saith the lord and thy redeemer the holy one of israel 4115 behold i will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth thou shalt thresh the mountains and beat them small and shalt make the hills as chaff 4116 thou shalt fan them and the wind shall carry them away and the whirlwind shall scatter them and thou shalt rejoice in the lord and shalt glory in the holy one of israel 4117 when the poor and needy seek water and there is none and their tongue faileth for thirst i the lord will hear them i the god of israel will not forsake them 4118 i will open rivers in high places and fountains in the midst of the valleys i will make the wilderness a pool of water and the dry land springs of water 4119 i will plant in the wilderness the cedar the shittah tree and the myrtle and the oil tree i will set in the desert the fir tree and the pine and the box tree together 4120 that they may see and know and consider and understand together that the hand of the lord hath done this and the holy one of israel hath created it 4121 produce your cause saith the lord bring forth your strong reasons saith the king of jacob 4122 let them bring them forth and shew us what shall happen let them shew the former things what they be that we may consider them and know the latter end of them or declare us things for to come 4123 shew the things that are to come hereafter that we may know that ye are gods yea do good or do evil that we may be dismayed and behold it together 4124 behold ye are of nothing and your work of nought an abomination is he that chooseth you 4125 i have raised up one from the north and he shall come from the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name and he shall come upon princes as upon morter and as the potter treadeth clay 4126 who hath declared from the beginning that we may know and beforetime that we may say he is righteous yea there is none that sheweth yea there is none that declareth yea there is none that heareth your words 4127 the first shall say to zion behold behold them and i will give to jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings 4128 for i beheld and there was no man even among them and there was no counsellor that when i asked of them could answer a word 4129 behold they are all vanity their works are nothing their molten images are wind and confusion 421 behold my servant whom i uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighteth i have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles 422 he shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his voice to be heard in the street 423 a bruised reed shall he not break and the smoking flax shall he not quench he shall bring forth judgment unto truth 424 he shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth and the isles shall wait for his law 425 thus saith god the lord he that created the heavens and stretched them out he that spread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the people upon it and spirit to them that walk therein 426 i the lord have called thee in righteousness and will hold thine hand and will keep thee and give thee for a covenant of the people for a light of the gentiles 427 to open the blind eyes to bring out the prisoners from the prison and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house 428 i am the lord that is my name and my glory will i not give to another neither my praise to graven images 429 behold the former things are come to pass and new things do i declare before they spring forth i tell you of them 4210 sing unto the lord a new song and his praise from the end of the earth ye that go down to the sea and all that is therein the isles and the inhabitants thereof 4211 let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice the villages that kedar doth inhabit let the inhabitants of the rock sing let them shout from the top of the mountains 4212 let them give glory unto the lord and declare his praise in the islands 4213 the lord shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war he shall cry yea roar he shall prevail against his enemies 4214 i have long time holden my peace i have been still and refrained myself now will i cry like a travailing woman i will destroy and devour at once 4215 i will make waste mountains and hills and dry up all their herbs and i will make the rivers islands and i will dry up the pools 4216 and i will bring the blind by a way that they knew not i will lead them in paths that they have not known i will make darkness light before them and crooked things straight these things will i do unto them and not forsake them 4217 they shall be turned back they shall be greatly ashamed that trust in graven images that say to the molten images ye are our gods 4218 hear ye deaf and look ye blind that ye may see 4219 who is blind but my servant or deaf as my messenger that i sent who is blind as he that is perfect and blind as the lords servant 4220 seeing many things but thou observest not opening the ears but he heareth not 4221 the lord is well pleased for his righteousness sake he will magnify the law and make it honourable 4222 but this is a people robbed and spoiled they are all of them snared in holes and they are hid in prison houses they are for a prey and none delivereth for a spoil and none saith restore 4223 who among you will give ear to this who will hearken and hear for the time to come 4224 who gave jacob for a spoil and israel to the robbers did not the lord he against whom we have sinned for they would not walk in his ways neither were they obedient unto his law 4225 therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger and the strength of battle and it hath set him on fire round about yet he knew not and it burned him yet he laid it not to heart 431 but now thus saith the lord that created thee o jacob and he that formed thee o israel fear not for i have redeemed thee i have called thee by thy name thou art mine 432 when thou passest through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee 433 for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy saviour i gave egypt for thy ransom ethiopia and seba for thee 434 since thou wast precious in my sight thou hast been honourable and i have loved thee therefore will i give men for thee and people for thy life 435 fear not for i am with thee i will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west 436 i will say to the north give up and to the south keep not back bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth 437 even every one that is called by my name for i have created him for my glory i have formed him yea i have made him 438 bring forth the blind people that have eyes and the deaf that have ears 439 let all the nations be gathered together and let the people be assembled who among them can declare this and shew us former things let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say it is truth 4310 ye are my witnesses saith the lord and my servant whom i have chosen that ye may know and believe me and understand that i am he before me there was no god formed neither shall there be after me 4311 i even i am the lord and beside me there is no saviour 4312 i have declared and have saved and i have shewed when there was no strange god among you therefore ye are my witnesses saith the lord that i am god 4313 yea before the day was i am he and there is none that can deliver out of my hand i will work and who shall let it 4314 thus saith the lord your redeemer the holy one of israel for your sake i have sent to babylon and have brought down all their nobles and the chaldeans whose cry is in the ships 4315 i am the lord your holy one the creator of israel your king 4316 thus saith the lord which maketh a way in the sea and a path in the mighty waters 4317 which bringeth forth the chariot and horse the army and the power they shall lie down together they shall not rise they are extinct they are quenched as tow 4318 remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old 4319 behold i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall ye not know it i will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert 4320 the beast of the field shall honour me the dragons and the owls because i give waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert to give drink to my people my chosen 4321 this people have i formed for myself they shall shew forth my praise 4322 but thou hast not called upon me o jacob but thou hast been weary of me o israel 4323 thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices i have not caused thee to serve with an offering nor wearied thee with incense 4324 thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities 4325 i even i am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins 4326 put me in remembrance let us plead together declare thou that thou mayest be justified 4327 thy first father hath sinned and thy teachers have transgressed against me 4328 therefore i have profaned the princes of the sanctuary and have given jacob to the curse and israel to reproaches 441 yet now hear o jacob my servant and israel whom i have chosen 442 thus saith the lord that made thee and formed thee from the womb which will help thee fear not o jacob my servant and thou jesurun whom i have chosen 443 for i will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground i will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thine offspring 444 and they shall spring up as among the grass as willows by the water courses 445 one shall say i am the lords and another shall call himself by the name of jacob and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the lord and surname himself by the name of israel 446 thus saith the lord the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts i am the first and i am the last and beside me there is no god 447 and who as i shall call and shall declare it and set it in order for me since i appointed the ancient people and the things that are coming and shall come let them shew unto them 448 fear ye not neither be afraid have not i told thee from that time and have declared it ye are even my witnesses is there a god beside me yea there is no god i know not any 449 they that make a graven image are all of them vanity and their delectable things shall not profit and they are their own witnesses they see not nor know that they may be ashamed 4410 who hath formed a god or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing 4411 behold all his fellows shall be ashamed and the workmen they are of men let them all be gathered together let them stand up yet they shall fear and they shall be ashamed together 4412 the smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals and fashioneth it with hammers and worketh it with the strength of his arms yea he is hungry and his strength faileth he drinketh no water and is faint 4413 the carpenter stretcheth out his rule he marketh it out with a line he fitteth it with planes and he marketh it out with the compass and maketh it after the figure of a man according to the beauty of a man that it may remain in the house 4414 he heweth him down cedars and taketh the cypress and the oak which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest he planteth an ash and the rain doth nourish it 4415 then shall it be for a man to burn for he will take thereof and warm himself yea he kindleth it and baketh bread yea he maketh a god and worshippeth it he maketh it a graven image and falleth down thereto 4416 he burneth part thereof in the fire with part thereof he eateth flesh he roasteth roast and is satisfied yea he warmeth himself and saith aha i am warm i have seen the fire 4417 and the residue thereof he maketh a god even his graven image he falleth down unto it and worshippeth it and prayeth unto it and saith deliver me for thou art my god 4418 they have not known nor understood for he hath shut their eyes that they cannot see and their hearts that they cannot understand 4419 and none considereth in his heart neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say i have burned part of it in the fire yea also i have baked bread upon the coals thereof i have roasted flesh and eaten it and shall i make the residue thereof an abomination shall i fall down to the stock of a tree 4420 he feedeth on ashes a deceived heart hath turned him aside that he cannot deliver his soul nor say is there not a lie in my right hand 4421 remember these o jacob and israel for thou art my servant i have formed thee thou art my servant o israel thou shalt not be forgotten of me 4422 i have blotted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return unto me for i have redeemed thee 4423 sing o ye heavens for the lord hath done it shout ye lower parts of the earth break forth into singing ye mountains o forest and every tree therein for the lord hath redeemed jacob and glorified himself in israel 4424 thus saith the lord thy redeemer and he that formed thee from the womb i am the lord that maketh all things that stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself 4425 that frustrateth the tokens of the liars and maketh diviners mad that turneth wise men backward and maketh their knowledge foolish 4426 that confirmeth the word of his servant and performeth the counsel of his messengers that saith to jerusalem thou shalt be inhabited and to the cities of judah ye shall be built and i will raise up the decayed places thereof 4427 that saith to the deep be dry and i will dry up thy rivers 4428 that saith of cyrus he is my shepherd and shall perform all my pleasure even saying to jerusalem thou shalt be built and to the temple thy foundation shall be laid 451 thus saith the lord to his anointed to cyrus whose right hand i have holden to subdue nations before him and i will loose the loins of kings to open before him the two leaved gates and the gates shall not be shut 452 i will go before thee and make the crooked places straight i will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in sunder the bars of iron 453 and i will give thee the treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places that thou mayest know that i the lord which call thee by thy name am the god of israel 454 for jacob my servants sake and israel mine elect i have even called thee by thy name i have surnamed thee though thou hast not known me 455 i am the lord and there is none else there is no god beside me i girded thee though thou hast not known me 456 that they may know from the rising of the sun and from the west that there is none beside me i am the lord and there is none else 457 i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create evil i the lord do all these things 458 drop down ye heavens from above and let the skies pour down righteousness let the earth open and let them bring forth salvation and let righteousness spring up together i the lord have created it 459 woe unto him that striveth with his maker let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it what makest thou or thy work he hath no hands 4510 woe unto him that saith unto his father what begettest thou or to the woman what hast thou brought forth 4511 thus saith the lord the holy one of israel and his maker ask me of things to come concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands command ye me 4512 i have made the earth and created man upon it i even my hands have stretched out the heavens and all their host have i commanded 4513 i have raised him up in righteousness and i will direct all his ways he shall build my city and he shall let go my captives not for price nor reward saith the lord of hosts 4514 thus saith the lord the labour of egypt and merchandise of ethiopia and of the sabeans men of stature shall come over unto thee and they shall be thine they shall come after thee in chains they shall come over and they shall fall down unto thee they shall make supplication unto thee saying surely god is in thee and there is none else there is no god 4515 verily thou art a god that hidest thyself o god of israel the saviour 4516 they shall be ashamed and also confounded all of them they shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols 4517 but israel shall be saved in the lord with an everlasting salvation ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end 4518 for thus saith the lord that created the heavens god himself that formed the earth and made it he hath established it he created it not in vain he formed it to be inhabited i am the lord and there is none else 4519 i have not spoken in secret in a dark place of the earth i said not unto the seed of jacob seek ye me in vain i the lord speak righteousness i declare things that are right 4520 assemble yourselves and come draw near together ye that are escaped of the nations they have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image and pray unto a god that cannot save 4521 tell ye and bring them near yea let them take counsel together who hath declared this from ancient time who hath told it from that time have not i the lord and there is no god else beside me a just god and a saviour there is none beside me 4522 look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else 4523 i have sworn by myself the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return that unto me every knee shall bow every tongue shall swear 4524 surely shall one say in the lord have i righteousness and strength even to him shall men come and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed 4525 in the lord shall all the seed of israel be justified and shall glory 461 bel boweth down nebo stoopeth their idols were upon the beasts and upon the cattle your carriages were heavy loaden they are a burden to the weary beast 462 they stoop they bow down together they could not deliver the burden but themselves are gone into captivity 463 hearken unto me o house of jacob and all the remnant of the house of israel which are borne by me from the belly which are carried from the womb 464 and even to your old age i am he and even to hoar hairs will i carry you i have made and i will bear even i will carry and will deliver you 465 to whom will ye liken me and make me equal and compare me that we may be like 466 they lavish gold out of the bag and weigh silver in the balance and hire a goldsmith and he maketh it a god they fall down yea they worship 467 they bear him upon the shoulder they carry him and set him in his place and he standeth from his place shall he not remove yea one shall cry unto him yet can he not answer nor save him out of his trouble 468 remember this and shew yourselves men bring it again to mind o ye transgressors 469 remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me 4610 declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure 4611 calling a ravenous bird from the east the man that executeth my counsel from a far country yea i have spoken it i will also bring it to pass i have purposed it i will also do it 4612 hearken unto me ye stouthearted that are far from righteousness 4613 i bring near my righteousness it shall not be far off and my salvation shall not tarry and i will place salvation in zion for israel my glory 471 come down and sit in the dust o virgin daughter of babylon sit on the ground there is no throne o daughter of the chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate 472 take the millstones and grind meal uncover thy locks make bare the leg uncover the thigh pass over the rivers 473 thy nakedness shall be uncovered yea thy shame shall be seen i will take vengeance and i will not meet thee as a man 474 as for our redeemer the lord of hosts is his name the holy one of israel 475 sit thou silent and get thee into darkness o daughter of the chaldeans for thou shalt no more be called the lady of kingdoms 476 i was wroth with my people i have polluted mine inheritance and given them into thine hand thou didst shew them no mercy upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke 477 and thou saidst i shall be a lady for ever so that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart neither didst remember the latter end of it 478 therefore hear now this thou that art given to pleasures that dwellest carelessly that sayest in thine heart i am and none else beside me i shall not sit as a widow neither shall i know the loss of children 479 but these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day the loss of children and widowhood they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries and for the great abundance of thine enchantments 4710 for thou hast trusted in thy wickedness thou hast said none seeth me thy wisdom and thy knowledge it hath perverted thee and thou hast said in thine heart i am and none else beside me 4711 therefore shall evil come upon thee thou shalt not know from whence it riseth and mischief shall fall upon thee thou shalt not be able to put it off and desolation shall come upon thee suddenly which thou shalt not know 4712 stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy sorceries wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth if so be thou shalt be able to profit if so be thou mayest prevail 4713 thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels let now the astrologers the stargazers the monthly prognosticators stand up and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee 4714 behold they shall be as stubble the fire shall burn them they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame there shall not be a coal to warm at nor fire to sit before it 4715 thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured even thy merchants from thy youth they shall wander every one to his quarter none shall save thee 481 hear ye this o house of jacob which are called by the name of israel and are come forth out of the waters of judah which swear by the name of the lord and make mention of the god of israel but not in truth nor in righteousness 482 for they call themselves of the holy city and stay themselves upon the god of israel the lord of hosts is his name 483 i have declared the former things from the beginning and they went forth out of my mouth and i shewed them i did them suddenly and they came to pass 484 because i knew that thou art obstinate and thy neck is an iron sinew and thy brow brass 485 i have even from the beginning declared it to thee before it came to pass i shewed it thee lest thou shouldest say mine idol hath done them and my graven image and my molten image hath commanded them 486 thou hast heard see all this and will not ye declare it i have shewed thee new things from this time even hidden things and thou didst not know them 487 they are created now and not from the beginning even before the day when thou heardest them not lest thou shouldest say behold i knew them 488 yea thou heardest not yea thou knewest not yea from that time that thine ear was not opened for i knew that thou wouldest deal very treacherously and wast called a transgressor from the womb 489 for my names sake will i defer mine anger and for my praise will i refrain for thee that i cut thee not off 4810 behold i have refined thee but not with silver i have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction 4811 for mine own sake even for mine own sake will i do it for how should my name be polluted and i will not give my glory unto another 4812 hearken unto me o jacob and israel my called i am he i am the first i also am the last 4813 mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth and my right hand hath spanned the heavens when i call unto them they stand up together 4814 all ye assemble yourselves and hear which among them hath declared these things the lord hath loved him he will do his pleasure on babylon and his arm shall be on the chaldeans 4815 i even i have spoken yea i have called him i have brought him and he shall make his way prosperous 4816 come ye near unto me hear ye this i have not spoken in secret from the beginning from the time that it was there am i and now the lord god and his spirit hath sent me 4817 thus saith the lord thy redeemer the holy one of israel i am the lord thy god which teacheth thee to profit which leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go 4818 o that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments then had thy peace been as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea 4819 thy seed also had been as the sand and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me 4820 go ye forth of babylon flee ye from the chaldeans with a voice of singing declare ye tell this utter it even to the end of the earth say ye the lord hath redeemed his servant jacob 4821 and they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them he clave the rock also and the waters gushed out 4822 there is no peace saith the lord unto the wicked 491 listen o isles unto me and hearken ye people from far the lord hath called me from the womb from the bowels of my mother hath he made mention of my name 492 and he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand hath he hid me and made me a polished shaft in his quiver hath he hid me 493 and said unto me thou art my servant o israel in whom i will be glorified 494 then i said i have laboured in vain i have spent my strength for nought and in vain yet surely my judgment is with the lord and my work with my god 495 and now saith the lord that formed me from the womb to be his servant to bring jacob again to him though israel be not gathered yet shall i be glorious in the eyes of the lord and my god shall be my strength 496 and he said it is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of jacob and to restore the preserved of israel i will also give thee for a light to the gentiles that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth 497 thus saith the lord the redeemer of israel and his holy one to him whom man despiseth to him whom the nation abhorreth to a servant of rulers kings shall see and arise princes also shall worship because of the lord that is faithful and the holy one of israel and he shall choose thee 498 thus saith the lord in an acceptable time have i heard thee and in a day of salvation have i helped thee and i will preserve thee and give thee for a covenant of the people to establish the earth to cause to inherit the desolate heritages 499 that thou mayest say to the prisoners go forth to them that are in darkness shew yourselves they shall feed in the ways and their pastures shall be in all high places 4910 they shall not hunger nor thirst neither shall the heat nor sun smite them for he that hath mercy on them shall lead them even by the springs of water shall he guide them 4911 and i will make all my mountains a way and my highways shall be exalted 4912 behold these shall come from far and lo these from the north and from the west and these from the land of sinim 4913 sing o heavens and be joyful o earth and break forth into singing o mountains for the lord hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted 4914 but zion said the lord hath forsaken me and my lord hath forgotten me 4915 can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yea they may forget yet will i not forget thee 4916 behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands thy walls are continually before me 4917 thy children shall make haste thy destroyers and they that made thee waste shall go forth of thee 4918 lift up thine eyes round about and behold all these gather themselves together and come to thee as i live saith the lord thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all as with an ornament and bind them on thee as a bride doeth 4919 for thy waste and thy desolate places and the land of thy destruction shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants and they that swallowed thee up shall be far away 4920 the children which thou shalt have after thou hast lost the other shall say again in thine ears the place is too strait for me give place to me that i may dwell 4921 then shalt thou say in thine heart who hath begotten me these seeing i have lost my children and am desolate a captive and removing to and fro and who hath brought up these behold i was left alone these where had they been 4922 thus saith the lord god behold i will lift up mine hand to the gentiles and set up my standard to the people and they shall bring thy sons in their arms and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders 4923 and kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their queens thy nursing mothers they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth and lick up the dust of thy feet and thou shalt know that i am the lord for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me 4924 shall the prey be taken from the mighty or the lawful captive delivered 4925 but thus saith the lord even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered for i will contend with him that contendeth with thee and i will save thy children 4926 and i will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh and they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine and all flesh shall know that i the lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer the mighty one of jacob 501 thus saith the lord where is the bill of your mothers divorcement whom i have put away or which of my creditors is it to whom i have sold you behold for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves and for your transgressions is your mother put away 502 wherefore when i came was there no man when i called was there none to answer is my hand shortened at all that it cannot redeem or have i no power to deliver behold at my rebuke i dry up the sea i make the rivers a wilderness their fish stinketh because there is no water and dieth for thirst 503 i clothe the heavens with blackness and i make sackcloth their covering 504 the lord god hath given me the tongue of the learned that i should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary he wakeneth morning by morning he wakeneth mine ear to hear as the learned 505 the lord god hath opened mine ear and i was not rebellious neither turned away back 506 i gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair i hid not my face from shame and spitting 507 for the lord god will help me therefore shall i not be confounded therefore have i set my face like a flint and i know that i shall not be ashamed 508 he is near that justifieth me who will contend with me let us stand together who is mine adversary let him come near to me 509 behold the lord god will help me who is he that shall condemn me lo they all shall wax old as a garment the moth shall eat them up 5010 who is among you that feareth the lord that obeyeth the voice of his servant that walketh in darkness and hath no light let him trust in the name of the lord and stay upon his god 5011 behold all ye that kindle a fire that compass yourselves about with sparks walk in the light of your fire and in the sparks that ye have kindled this shall ye have of mine hand ye shall lie down in sorrow 511 hearken to me ye that follow after righteousness ye that seek the lord look unto the rock whence ye are hewn and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged 512 look unto abraham your father and unto sarah that bare you for i called him alone and blessed him and increased him 513 for the lord shall comfort zion he will comfort all her waste places and he will make her wilderness like eden and her desert like the garden of the lord joy and gladness shall be found therein thanksgiving and the voice of melody 514 hearken unto me my people and give ear unto me o my nation for a law shall proceed from me and i will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people 515 my righteousness is near my salvation is gone forth and mine arms shall judge the people the isles shall wait upon me and on mine arm shall they trust 516 lift up your eyes to the heavens and look upon the earth beneath for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke and the earth shall wax old like a garment and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner but my salvation shall be for ever and my righteousness shall not be abolished 517 hearken unto me ye that know righteousness the people in whose heart is my law fear ye not the reproach of men neither be ye afraid of their revilings 518 for the moth shall eat them up like a garment and the worm shall eat them like wool but my righteousness shall be for ever and my salvation from generation to generation 519 awake awake put on strength o arm of the lord awake as in the ancient days in the generations of old art thou not it that hath cut rahab and wounded the dragon 5110 art thou not it which hath dried the sea the waters of the great deep that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over 5111 therefore the redeemed of the lord shall return and come with singing unto zion and everlasting joy shall be upon their head they shall obtain gladness and joy and sorrow and mourning shall flee away 5112 i even i am he that comforteth you who art thou that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die and of the son of man which shall be made as grass 5113 and forgettest the lord thy maker that hath stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth and hast feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor as if he were ready to destroy and where is the fury of the oppressor 5114 the captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed and that he should not die in the pit nor that his bread should fail 5115 but i am the lord thy god that divided the sea whose waves roared the lord of hosts is his name 5116 and i have put my words in thy mouth and i have covered thee in the shadow of mine hand that i may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth and say unto zion thou art my people 5117 awake awake stand up o jerusalem which hast drunk at the hand of the lord the cup of his fury thou hast drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling and wrung them out 5118 there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath brought forth neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she hath brought up 5119 these two things are come unto thee who shall be sorry for thee desolation and destruction and the famine and the sword by whom shall i comfort thee 5120 thy sons have fainted they lie at the head of all the streets as a wild bull in a net they are full of the fury of the lord the rebuke of thy god 5121 therefore hear now this thou afflicted and drunken but not with wine 5122 thus saith thy lord the lord and thy god that pleadeth the cause of his people behold i have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling even the dregs of the cup of my fury thou shalt no more drink it again 5123 but i will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee which have said to thy soul bow down that we may go over and thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the street to them that went over 521 awake awake put on thy strength o zion put on thy beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean 522 shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down o jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck o captive daughter of zion 523 for thus saith the lord ye have sold yourselves for nought and ye shall be redeemed without money 524 for thus saith the lord god my people went down aforetime into egypt to sojourn there and the assyrian oppressed them without cause 525 now therefore what have i here saith the lord that my people is taken away for nought they that rule over them make them to howl saith the lord and my name continually every day is blasphemed 526 therefore my people shall know my name therefore they shall know in that day that i am he that doth speak behold it is i 527 how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace that bringeth good tidings of good that publisheth salvation that saith unto zion thy god reigneth 528 thy watchmen shall lift up the voice with the voice together shall they sing for they shall see eye to eye when the lord shall bring again zion 529 break forth into joy sing together ye waste places of jerusalem for the lord hath comforted his people he hath redeemed jerusalem 5210 the lord hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our god 5211 depart ye depart ye go ye out from thence touch no unclean thing go ye out of the midst of her be ye clean that bear the vessels of the lord 5212 for ye shall not go out with haste nor go by flight for the lord will go before you and the god of israel will be your rereward 5213 behold my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high 5214 as many were astonied at thee his visage was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men 5215 so shall he sprinkle many nations the kings shall shut their mouths at him for that which had not been told them shall they see and that which they had not heard shall they consider 531 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed 532 for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him 533 he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not 534 surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted 535 but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed 536 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all 537 he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so he openeth not his mouth 538 he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken 539 and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth 5310 yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand 5311 he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities 5312 therefore will i divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors 541 sing o barren thou that didst not bear break forth into singing and cry aloud thou that didst not travail with child for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife saith the lord 542 enlarge the place of thy tent and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations spare not lengthen thy cords and strengthen thy stakes 543 for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left and thy seed shall inherit the gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited 544 fear not for thou shalt not be ashamed neither be thou confounded for thou shalt not be put to shame for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more 545 for thy maker is thine husband the lord of hosts is his name and thy redeemer the holy one of israel the god of the whole earth shall he be called 546 for the lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit and a wife of youth when thou wast refused saith thy god 547 for a small moment have i forsaken thee but with great mercies will i gather thee 548 in a little wrath i hid my face from thee for a moment but with everlasting kindness will i have mercy on thee saith the lord thy redeemer 549 for this is as the waters of noah unto me for as i have sworn that the waters of noah should no more go over the earth so have i sworn that i would not be wroth with thee nor rebuke thee 5410 for the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed but my kindness shall not depart from thee neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed saith the lord that hath mercy on thee 5411 o thou afflicted tossed with tempest and not comforted behold i will lay thy stones with fair colours and lay thy foundations with sapphires 5412 and i will make thy windows of agates and thy gates of carbuncles and all thy borders of pleasant stones 5413 and all thy children shall be taught of the lord and great shall be the peace of thy children 5414 in righteousness shalt thou be established thou shalt be far from oppression for thou shalt not fear and from terror for it shall not come near thee 5415 behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sake 5416 behold i have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and i have created the waster to destroy 5417 no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and their righteousness is of me saith the lord 551 ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that hath no money come ye buy and eat yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price 552 wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread and your labour for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness 553 incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david 554 behold i have given him for a witness to the people a leader and commander to the people 555 behold thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the lord thy god and for the holy one of israel for he hath glorified thee 556 seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near 557 let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon 558 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord 559 for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts 5510 for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater 5511 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it 5512 for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands 5513 instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree and it shall be to the lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off 561 thus saith the lord keep ye judgment and do justice for my salvation is near to come and my righteousness to be revealed 562 blessed is the man that doeth this and the son of man that layeth hold on it that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and keepeth his hand from doing any evil 563 neither let the son of the stranger that hath joined himself to the lord speak saying the lord hath utterly separated me from his people neither let the eunuch say behold i am a dry tree 564 for thus saith the lord unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths and choose the things that please me and take hold of my covenant 565 even unto them will i give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters i will give them an everlasting name that shall not be cut off 566 also the sons of the stranger that join themselves to the lord to serve him and to love the name of the lord to be his servants every one that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it and taketh hold of my covenant 567 even them will i bring to my holy mountain and make them joyful in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people 568 the lord god which gathereth the outcasts of israel saith yet will i gather others to him beside those that are gathered unto him 569 all ye beasts of the field come to devour yea all ye beasts in the forest 5610 his watchmen are blind they are all ignorant they are all dumb dogs they cannot bark sleeping lying down loving to slumber 5611 yea they are greedy dogs which can never have enough and they are shepherds that cannot understand they all look to their own way every one for his gain from his quarter 5612 come ye say they i will fetch wine and we will fill ourselves with strong drink and to morrow shall be as this day and much more abundant 571 the righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart and merciful men are taken away none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come 572 he shall enter into peace they shall rest in their beds each one walking in his uprightness 573 but draw near hither ye sons of the sorceress the seed of the adulterer and the whore 574 against whom do ye sport yourselves against whom make ye a wide mouth and draw out the tongue are ye not children of transgression a seed of falsehood 575 enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the rocks 576 among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion they they are thy lot even to them hast thou poured a drink offering thou hast offered a meat offering should i receive comfort in these 577 upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed even thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice 578 behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy remembrance for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me and art gone up thou hast enlarged thy bed and made thee a covenant with them thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it 579 and thou wentest to the king with ointment and didst increase thy perfumes and didst send thy messengers far off and didst debase thyself even unto hell 5710 thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way yet saidst thou not there is no hope thou hast found the life of thine hand therefore thou wast not grieved 5711 and of whom hast thou been afraid or feared that thou hast lied and hast not remembered me nor laid it to thy heart have not i held my peace even of old and thou fearest me not 5712 i will declare thy righteousness and thy works for they shall not profit thee 5713 when thou criest let thy companies deliver thee but the wind shall carry them all away vanity shall take them but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my holy mountain 5714 and shall say cast ye up cast ye up prepare the way take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people 5715 for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones 5716 for i will not contend for ever neither will i be always wroth for the spirit should fail before me and the souls which i have made 5717 for the iniquity of his covetousness was i wroth and smote him i hid me and was wroth and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart 5718 i have seen his ways and will heal him i will lead him also and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners 5719 i create the fruit of the lips peace peace to him that is far off and to him that is near saith the lord and i will heal him 5720 but the wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest whose waters cast up mire and dirt 5721 there is no peace saith my god to the wicked 581 cry aloud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and shew my people their transgression and the house of jacob their sins 582 yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their god they ask of me the ordinances of justice they take delight in approaching to god 583 wherefore have we fasted say they and thou seest not wherefore have we afflicted our soul and thou takest no knowledge behold in the day of your fast ye find pleasure and exact all your labours 584 behold ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on high 585 is it such a fast that i have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the lord 586 is not this the fast that i have chosen to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free and that ye break every yoke 587 is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh 588 then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine health shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the lord shall be thy rereward 589 then shalt thou call and the lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say here i am if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke the putting forth of the finger and speaking vanity 5810 and if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noon day 5811 and the lord shall guide thee continually and satisfy thy soul in drought and make fat thy bones and thou shalt be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail not 5812 and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach the restorer of paths to dwell in 5813 if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight the holy of the lord honourable and shalt honour him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words 5814 then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord and i will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth and feed thee with the heritage of jacob thy father for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it 591 behold the lords hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear 592 but your iniquities have separated between you and your god and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear 593 for your hands are defiled with blood and your fingers with iniquity your lips have spoken lies your tongue hath muttered perverseness 594 none calleth for justice nor any pleadeth for truth they trust in vanity and speak lies they conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity 595 they hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spiders web he that eateth of their eggs dieth and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper 596 their webs shall not become garments neither shall they cover themselves with their works their works are works of iniquity and the act of violence is in their hands 597 their feet run to evil and they make haste to shed innocent blood their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity wasting and destruction are in their paths 598 the way of peace they know not and there is no judgment in their goings they have made them crooked paths whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace 599 therefore is judgment far from us neither doth justice overtake us we wait for light but behold obscurity for brightness but we walk in darkness 5910 we grope for the wall like the blind and we grope as if we had no eyes we stumble at noon day as in the night we are in desolate places as dead men 5911 we roar all like bears and mourn sore like doves we look for judgment but there is none for salvation but it is far off from us 5912 for our transgressions are multiplied before thee and our sins testify against us for our transgressions are with us and as for our iniquities we know them 5913 in transgressing and lying against the lord and departing away from our god speaking oppression and revolt conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood 5914 and judgment is turned away backward and justice standeth afar off for truth is fallen in the street and equity cannot enter 5915 yea truth faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey and the lord saw it and it displeased him that there was no judgment 5916 and he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his righteousness it sustained him 5917 for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak 5918 according to their deeds accordingly he will repay fury to his adversaries recompence to his enemies to the islands he will repay recompence 5919 so shall they fear the name of the lord from the west and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him 5920 and the redeemer shall come to zion and unto them that turn from transgression in jacob saith the lord 5921 as for me this is my covenant with them saith the lord my spirit that is upon thee and my words which i have put in thy mouth shall not depart out of thy mouth nor out of the mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed saith the lord from henceforth and for ever 601 arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee 602 for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee 603 and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising 604 lift up thine eyes round about and see all they gather themselves together they come to thee thy sons shall come from far and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side 605 then thou shalt see and flow together and thine heart shall fear and be enlarged because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee the forces of the gentiles shall come unto thee 606 the multitude of camels shall cover thee the dromedaries of midian and ephah all they from sheba shall come they shall bring gold and incense and they shall shew forth the praises of the lord 607 all the flocks of kedar shall be gathered together unto thee the rams of nebaioth shall minister unto thee they shall come up with acceptance on mine altar and i will glorify the house of my glory 608 who are these that fly as a cloud and as the doves to their windows 609 surely the isles shall wait for me and the ships of tarshish first to bring thy sons from far their silver and their gold with them unto the name of the lord thy god and to the holy one of israel because he hath glorified thee 6010 and the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls and their kings shall minister unto thee for in my wrath i smote thee but in my favour have i had mercy on thee 6011 therefore thy gates shall be open continually they shall not be shut day nor night that men may bring unto thee the forces of the gentiles and that their kings may be brought 6012 for the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish yea those nations shall be utterly wasted 6013 the glory of lebanon shall come unto thee the fir tree the pine tree and the box together to beautify the place of my sanctuary and i will make the place of my feet glorious 6014 the sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending unto thee and all they that despised thee shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet and they shall call thee the city of the lord the zion of the holy one of israel 6015 whereas thou has been forsaken and hated so that no man went through thee i will make thee an eternal excellency a joy of many generations 6016 thou shalt also suck the milk of the gentiles and shalt suck the breast of kings and thou shalt know that i the lord am thy saviour and thy redeemer the mighty one of jacob 6017 for brass i will bring gold and for iron i will bring silver and for wood brass and for stones iron i will also make thy officers peace and thine exactors righteousness 6018 violence shall no more be heard in thy land wasting nor destruction within thy borders but thou shalt call thy walls salvation and thy gates praise 6019 the sun shall be no more thy light by day neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee but the lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light and thy god thy glory 6020 thy sun shall no more go down neither shall thy moon withdraw itself for the lord shall be thine everlasting light and the days of thy mourning shall be ended 6021 thy people also shall be all righteous they shall inherit the land for ever the branch of my planting the work of my hands that i may be glorified 6022 a little one shall become a thousand and a small one a strong nation i the lord will hasten it in his time 611 the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound 612 to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that mourn 613 to appoint unto them that mourn in zion to give unto them beauty for ashes the oil of joy for mourning the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness that they might be called trees of righteousness the planting of the lord that he might be glorified 614 and they shall build the old wastes they shall raise up the former desolations and they shall repair the waste cities the desolations of many generations 615 and strangers shall stand and feed your flocks and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers 616 but ye shall be named the priests of the lord men shall call you the ministers of our god ye shall eat the riches of the gentiles and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves 617 for your shame ye shall have double and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion therefore in their land they shall possess the double everlasting joy shall be unto them 618 for i the lord love judgment i hate robbery for burnt offering and i will direct their work in truth and i will make an everlasting covenant with them 619 and their seed shall be known among the gentiles and their offspring among the people all that see them shall acknowledge them that they are the seed which the lord hath blessed 6110 i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels 6111 for as the earth bringeth forth her bud and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth so the lord god will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations 621 for zions sake will i not hold my peace and for jerusalems sake i will not rest until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth 622 and the gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all kings thy glory and thou shalt be called by a new name which the mouth of the lord shall name 623 thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the lord and a royal diadem in the hand of thy god 624 thou shalt no more be termed forsaken neither shall thy land any more be termed desolate but thou shalt be called hephzibah and thy land beulah for the lord delighteth in thee and thy land shall be married 625 for as a young man marrieth a virgin so shall thy sons marry thee and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride so shall thy god rejoice over thee 626 i have set watchmen upon thy walls o jerusalem which shall never hold their peace day nor night ye that make mention of the lord keep not silence 627 and give him no rest till he establish and till he make jerusalem a praise in the earth 628 the lord hath sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his strength surely i will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine for the which thou hast laboured 629 but they that have gathered it shall eat it and praise the lord and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness 6210 go through go through the gates prepare ye the way of the people cast up cast up the highway gather out the stones lift up a standard for the people 6211 behold the lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world say ye to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work before him 6212 and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the lord and thou shalt be called sought out a city not forsaken 631 who is this that cometh from edom with dyed garments from bozrah this that is glorious in his apparel travelling in the greatness of his strength i that speak in righteousness mighty to save 632 wherefore art thou red in thine apparel and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat 633 i have trodden the winepress alone and of the people there was none with me for i will tread them in mine anger and trample them in my fury and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments and i will stain all my raiment 634 for the day of vengeance is in mine heart and the year of my redeemed is come 635 and i looked and there was none to help and i wondered that there was none to uphold therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto me and my fury it upheld me 636 and i will tread down the people in mine anger and make them drunk in my fury and i will bring down their strength to the earth 637 i will mention the lovingkindnesses of the lord and the praises of the lord according to all that the lord hath bestowed on us and the great goodness toward the house of israel which he hath bestowed on them according to his mercies and according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses 638 for he said surely they are my people children that will not lie so he was their saviour 639 in all their affliction he was afflicted and the angel of his presence saved them in his love and in his pity he redeemed them and he bare them and carried them all the days of old 6310 but they rebelled and vexed his holy spirit therefore he was turned to be their enemy and he fought against them 6311 then he remembered the days of old moses and his people saying where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock where is he that put his holy spirit within him 6312 that led them by the right hand of moses with his glorious arm dividing the water before them to make himself an everlasting name 6313 that led them through the deep as an horse in the wilderness that they should not stumble 6314 as a beast goeth down into the valley the spirit of the lord caused him to rest so didst thou lead thy people to make thyself a glorious name 6315 look down from heaven and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory where is thy zeal and thy strength the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me are they restrained 6316 doubtless thou art our father though abraham be ignorant of us and israel acknowledge us not thou o lord art our father our redeemer thy name is from everlasting 6317 o lord why hast thou made us to err from thy ways and hardened our heart from thy fear return for thy servants sake the tribes of thine inheritance 6318 the people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little while our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary 6319 we are thine thou never barest rule over them they were not called by thy name 641 oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens that thou wouldest come down that the mountains might flow down at thy presence 642 as when the melting fire burneth the fire causeth the waters to boil to make thy name known to thine adversaries that the nations may tremble at thy presence 643 when thou didst terrible things which we looked not for thou camest down the mountains flowed down at thy presence 644 for since the beginning of the world men have not heard nor perceived by the ear neither hath the eye seen o god beside thee what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him 645 thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness those that remember thee in thy ways behold thou art wroth for we have sinned in those is continuance and we shall be saved 646 but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we all do fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away 647 and there is none that calleth upon thy name that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee for thou hast hid thy face from us and hast consumed us because of our iniquities 648 but now o lord thou art our father we are the clay and thou our potter and we all are the work of thy hand 649 be not wroth very sore o lord neither remember iniquity for ever behold see we beseech thee we are all thy people 6410 thy holy cities are a wilderness zion is a wilderness jerusalem a desolation 6411 our holy and our beautiful house where our fathers praised thee is burned up with fire and all our pleasant things are laid waste 6412 wilt thou refrain thyself for these things o lord wilt thou hold thy peace and afflict us very sore 651 i am sought of them that asked not for me i am found of them that sought me not i said behold me behold me unto a nation that was not called by my name 652 i have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people which walketh in a way that was not good after their own thoughts 653 a people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face that sacrificeth in gardens and burneth incense upon altars of brick 654 which remain among the graves and lodge in the monuments which eat swines flesh and broth of abominable things is in their vessels 655 which say stand by thyself come not near to me for i am holier than thou these are a smoke in my nose a fire that burneth all the day 656 behold it is written before me i will not keep silence but will recompense even recompense into their bosom 657 your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together saith the lord which have burned incense upon the mountains and blasphemed me upon the hills therefore will i measure their former work into their bosom 658 thus saith the lord as the new wine is found in the cluster and one saith destroy it not for a blessing is in it so will i do for my servants sakes that i may not destroy them all 659 and i will bring forth a seed out of jacob and out of judah an inheritor of my mountains and mine elect shall inherit it and my servants shall dwell there 6510 and sharon shall be a fold of flocks and the valley of achor a place for the herds to lie down in for my people that have sought me 6511 but ye are they that forsake the lord that forget my holy mountain that prepare a table for that troop and that furnish the drink offering unto that number 6512 therefore will i number you to the sword and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter because when i called ye did not answer when i spake ye did not hear but did evil before mine eyes and did choose that wherein i delighted not 6513 therefore thus saith the lord god behold my servants shall eat but ye shall be hungry behold my servants shall drink but ye shall be thirsty behold my servants shall rejoice but ye shall be ashamed 6514 behold my servants shall sing for joy of heart but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart and shall howl for vexation of spirit 6515 and ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen for the lord god shall slay thee and call his servants by another name 6516 that he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself in the god of truth and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by the god of truth because the former troubles are forgotten and because they are hid from mine eyes 6517 for behold i create new heavens and a new earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind 6518 but be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which i create for behold i create jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy 6519 and i will rejoice in jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying 6520 there shall be no more thence an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die an hundred years old but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed 6521 and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them 6522 they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands 6523 they shall not labour in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with them 6524 and it shall come to pass that before they call i will answer and while they are yet speaking i will hear 6525 the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpents meat they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain saith the lord 661 thus saith the lord the heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house that ye build unto me and where is the place of my rest 662 for all those things hath mine hand made and all those things have been saith the lord but to this man will i look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word 663 he that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man he that sacrificeth a lamb as if he cut off a dogs neck he that offereth an oblation as if he offered swines blood he that burneth incense as if he blessed an idol yea they have chosen their own ways and their soul delighteth in their abominations 664 i also will choose their delusions and will bring their fears upon them because when i called none did answer when i spake they did not hear but they did evil before mine eyes and chose that in which i delighted not 665 hear the word of the lord ye that tremble at his word your brethren that hated you that cast you out for my names sake said let the lord be glorified but he shall appear to your joy and they shall be ashamed 666 a voice of noise from the city a voice from the temple a voice of the lord that rendereth recompence to his enemies 667 before she travailed she brought forth before her pain came she was delivered of a man child 668 who hath heard such a thing who hath seen such things shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children 669 shall i bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth saith the lord shall i cause to bring forth and shut the womb saith thy god 6610 rejoice ye with jerusalem and be glad with her all ye that love her rejoice for joy with her all ye that mourn for her 6611 that ye may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations that ye may milk out and be delighted with the abundance of her glory 6612 for thus saith the lord behold i will extend peace to her like a river and the glory of the gentiles like a flowing stream then shall ye suck ye shall be borne upon her sides and be dandled upon her knees 6613 as one whom his mother comforteth so will i comfort you and ye shall be comforted in jerusalem 6614 and when ye see this your heart shall rejoice and your bones shall flourish like an herb and the hand of the lord shall be known toward his servants and his indignation toward his enemies 6615 for behold the lord will come with fire and with his chariots like a whirlwind to render his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire 6616 for by fire and by his sword will the lord plead with all flesh and the slain of the lord shall be many 6617 they that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the midst eating swines flesh and the abomination and the mouse shall be consumed together saith the lord 6618 for i know their works and their thoughts it shall come that i will gather all nations and tongues and they shall come and see my glory 6619 and i will set a sign among them and i will send those that escape of them unto the nations to tarshish pul and lud that draw the bow to tubal and javan to the isles afar off that have not heard my fame neither have seen my glory and they shall declare my glory among the gentiles 6620 and they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the lord out of all nations upon horses and in chariots and in litters and upon mules and upon swift beasts to my holy mountain jerusalem saith the lord as the children of israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the lord 6621 and i will also take of them for priests and for levites saith the lord 6622 for as the new heavens and the new earth which i will make shall remain before me saith the lord so shall your seed and your name remain 6623 and it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another shall all flesh come to worship before me saith the lord 6624 and they shall go forth and look upon the carcases of the men that have transgressed against me for their worm shall not die neither shall their fire be quenched and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh the book of the prophet jeremiah 11 the words of jeremiah the son of hilkiah of the priests that were in anathoth in the land of benjamin 12 to whom the word of the lord came in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah in the thirteenth year of his reign 13 it came also in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah unto the end of the eleventh year of zedekiah the son of josiah king of judah unto the carrying away of jerusalem captive in the fifth month 14 then the word of the lord came unto me saying 15 before i formed thee in the belly i knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a prophet unto the nations 16 then said i ah lord god behold i cannot speak for i am a child 17 but the lord said unto me say not i am a child for thou shalt go to all that i shall send thee and whatsoever i command thee thou shalt speak 18 be not afraid of their faces for i am with thee to deliver thee saith the lord 19 then the lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth and the lord said unto me behold i have put my words in thy mouth 110 see i have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and to throw down to build and to plant 111 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying jeremiah what seest thou and i said i see a rod of an almond tree 112 then said the lord unto me thou hast well seen for i will hasten my word to perform it 113 and the word of the lord came unto me the second time saying what seest thou and i said i see a seething pot and the face thereof is toward the north 114 then the lord said unto me out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land 115 for lo i will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north saith the lord and they shall come and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of jerusalem and against all the walls thereof round about and against all the cities of judah 116 and i will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness who have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods and worshipped the works of their own hands 117 thou therefore gird up thy loins and arise and speak unto them all that i command thee be not dismayed at their faces lest i confound thee before them 118 for behold i have made thee this day a defenced city and an iron pillar and brasen walls against the whole land against the kings of judah against the princes thereof against the priests thereof and against the people of the land 119 and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for i am with thee saith the lord to deliver thee 21 moreover the word of the lord came to me saying 22 go and cry in the ears of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord i remember thee the kindness of thy youth the love of thine espousals when thou wentest after me in the wilderness in a land that was not sown 23 israel was holiness unto the lord and the firstfruits of his increase all that devour him shall offend evil shall come upon them saith the lord 24 hear ye the word of the lord o house of jacob and all the families of the house of israel 25 thus saith the lord what iniquity have your fathers found in me that they are gone far from me and have walked after vanity and are become vain 26 neither said they where is the lord that brought us up out of the land of egypt that led us through the wilderness through a land of deserts and of pits through a land of drought and of the shadow of death through a land that no man passed through and where no man dwelt 27 and i brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof but when ye entered ye defiled my land and made mine heritage an abomination 28 the priests said not where is the lord and they that handle the law knew me not the pastors also transgressed against me and the prophets prophesied by baal and walked after things that do not profit 29 wherefore i will yet plead with you saith the lord and with your childrens children will i plead 210 for pass over the isles of chittim and see and send unto kedar and consider diligently and see if there be such a thing 211 hath a nation changed their gods which are yet no gods but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit 212 be astonished o ye heavens at this and be horribly afraid be ye very desolate saith the lord 213 for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters and hewed them out cisterns broken cisterns that can hold no water 214 is israel a servant is he a homeborn slave why is he spoiled 215 the young lions roared upon him and yelled and they made his land waste his cities are burned without inhabitant 216 also the children of noph and tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head 217 hast thou not procured this unto thyself in that thou hast forsaken the lord thy god when he led thee by the way 218 and now what hast thou to do in the way of egypt to drink the waters of sihor or what hast thou to do in the way of assyria to drink the waters of the river 219 thine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy backslidings shall reprove thee know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the lord thy god and that my fear is not in thee saith the lord god of hosts 220 for of old time i have broken thy yoke and burst thy bands and thou saidst i will not transgress when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest playing the harlot 221 yet i had planted thee a noble vine wholly a right seed how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me 222 for though thou wash thee with nitre and take thee much soap yet thine iniquity is marked before me saith the lord god 223 how canst thou say i am not polluted i have not gone after baalim see thy way in the valley know what thou hast done thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways 224 a wild ass used to the wilderness that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure in her occasion who can turn her away all they that seek her will not weary themselves in her month they shall find her 225 withhold thy foot from being unshod and thy throat from thirst but thou saidst there is no hope no for i have loved strangers and after them will i go 226 as the thief is ashamed when he is found so is the house of israel ashamed they their kings their princes and their priests and their prophets 227 saying to a stock thou art my father and to a stone thou hast brought me forth for they have turned their back unto me and not their face but in the time of their trouble they will say arise and save us 228 but where are thy gods that thou hast made thee let them arise if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods o judah 229 wherefore will ye plead with me ye all have transgressed against me saith the lord 230 in vain have i smitten your children they received no correction your own sword hath devoured your prophets like a destroying lion 231 o generation see ye the word of the lord have i been a wilderness unto israel a land of darkness wherefore say my people we are lords we will come no more unto thee 232 can a maid forget her ornaments or a bride her attire yet my people have forgotten me days without number 233 why trimmest thou thy way to seek love therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways 234 also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents i have not found it by secret search but upon all these 235 yet thou sayest because i am innocent surely his anger shall turn from me behold i will plead with thee because thou sayest i have not sinned 236 why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way thou also shalt be ashamed of egypt as thou wast ashamed of assyria 237 yea thou shalt go forth from him and thine hands upon thine head for the lord hath rejected thy confidences and thou shalt not prosper in them 31 they say if a man put away his wife and she go from him and become another mans shall he return unto her again shall not that land be greatly polluted but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers yet return again to me saith the lord 32 lift up thine eyes unto the high places and see where thou hast not been lien with in the ways hast thou sat for them as the arabian in the wilderness and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness 33 therefore the showers have been withholden and there hath been no latter rain and thou hadst a whores forehead thou refusedst to be ashamed 34 wilt thou not from this time cry unto me my father thou art the guide of my youth 35 will he reserve his anger for ever will he keep it to the end behold thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest 36 the lord said also unto me in the days of josiah the king hast thou seen that which backsliding israel hath done she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree and there hath played the harlot 37 and i said after she had done all these things turn thou unto me but she returned not and her treacherous sister judah saw it 38 and i saw when for all the causes whereby backsliding israel committed adultery i had put her away and given her a bill of divorce yet her treacherous sister judah feared not but went and played the harlot also 39 and it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom that she defiled the land and committed adultery with stones and with stocks 310 and yet for all this her treacherous sister judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart but feignedly saith the lord 311 and the lord said unto me the backsliding israel hath justified herself more than treacherous judah 312 go and proclaim these words toward the north and say return thou backsliding israel saith the lord and i will not cause mine anger to fall upon you for i am merciful saith the lord and i will not keep anger for ever 313 only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast transgressed against the lord thy god and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree and ye have not obeyed my voice saith the lord 314 turn o backsliding children saith the lord for i am married unto you and i will take you one of a city and two of a family and i will bring you to zion 315 and i will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding 316 and it shall come to pass when ye be multiplied and increased in the land in those days saith the lord they shall say no more the ark of the covenant of the lord neither shall it come to mind neither shall they remember it neither shall they visit it neither shall that be done any more 317 at that time they shall call jerusalem the throne of the lord and all the nations shall be gathered unto it to the name of the lord to jerusalem neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart 318 in those days the house of judah shall walk with the house of israel and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that i have given for an inheritance unto your fathers 319 but i said how shall i put thee among the children and give thee a pleasant land a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations and i said thou shalt call me my father and shalt not turn away from me 320 surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband so have ye dealt treacherously with me o house of israel saith the lord 321 a voice was heard upon the high places weeping and supplications of the children of israel for they have perverted their way and they have forgotten the lord their god 322 return ye backsliding children and i will heal your backslidings behold we come unto thee for thou art the lord our god 323 truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills and from the multitude of mountains truly in the lord our god is the salvation of israel 324 for shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth their flocks and their herds their sons and their daughters 325 we lie down in our shame and our confusion covereth us for we have sinned against the lord our god we and our fathers from our youth even unto this day and have not obeyed the voice of the lord our god 41 if thou wilt return o israel saith the lord return unto me and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight then shalt thou not remove 42 and thou shalt swear the lord liveth in truth in judgment and in righteousness and the nations shall bless themselves in him and in him shall they glory 43 for thus saith the lord to the men of judah and jerusalem break up your fallow ground and sow not among thorns 44 circumcise yourselves to the lord and take away the foreskins of your heart ye men of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem lest my fury come forth like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings 45 declare ye in judah and publish in jerusalem and say blow ye the trumpet in the land cry gather together and say assemble yourselves and let us go into the defenced cities 46 set up the standard toward zion retire stay not for i will bring evil from the north and a great destruction 47 the lion is come up from his thicket and the destroyer of the gentiles is on his way he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate and thy cities shall be laid waste without an inhabitant 48 for this gird you with sackcloth lament and howl for the fierce anger of the lord is not turned back from us 49 and it shall come to pass at that day saith the lord that the heart of the king shall perish and the heart of the princes and the priests shall be astonished and the prophets shall wonder 410 then said i ah lord god surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and jerusalem saying ye shall have peace whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul 411 at that time shall it be said to this people and to jerusalem a dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my people not to fan nor to cleanse 412 even a full wind from those places shall come unto me now also will i give sentence against them 413 behold he shall come up as clouds and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind his horses are swifter than eagles woe unto us for we are spoiled 414 o jerusalem wash thine heart from wickedness that thou mayest be saved how long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee 415 for a voice declareth from dan and publisheth affliction from mount ephraim 416 make ye mention to the nations behold publish against jerusalem that watchers come from a far country and give out their voice against the cities of judah 417 as keepers of a field are they against her round about because she hath been rebellious against me saith the lord 418 thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee this is thy wickedness because it is bitter because it reacheth unto thine heart 419 my bowels my bowels i am pained at my very heart my heart maketh a noise in me i cannot hold my peace because thou hast heard o my soul the sound of the trumpet the alarm of war 420 destruction upon destruction is cried for the whole land is spoiled suddenly are my tents spoiled and my curtains in a moment 421 how long shall i see the standard and hear the sound of the trumpet 422 for my people is foolish they have not known me they are sottish children and they have none understanding they are wise to do evil but to do good they have no knowledge 423 i beheld the earth and lo it was without form and void and the heavens and they had no light 424 i beheld the mountains and lo they trembled and all the hills moved lightly 425 i beheld and lo there was no man and all the birds of the heavens were fled 426 i beheld and lo the fruitful place was a wilderness and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the lord and by his fierce anger 427 for thus hath the lord said the whole land shall be desolate yet will i not make a full end 428 for this shall the earth mourn and the heavens above be black because i have spoken it i have purposed it and will not repent neither will i turn back from it 429 the whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen they shall go into thickets and climb up upon the rocks every city shall be forsaken and not a man dwell therein 430 and when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do though thou clothest thyself with crimson though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold though thou rentest thy face with painting in vain shalt thou make thyself fair thy lovers will despise thee they will seek thy life 431 for i have heard a voice as of a woman in travail and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child the voice of the daughter of zion that bewaileth herself that spreadeth her hands saying woe is me now for my soul is wearied because of murderers 51 run ye to and fro through the streets of jerusalem and see now and know and seek in the broad places thereof if ye can find a man if there be any that executeth judgment that seeketh the truth and i will pardon it 52 and though they say the lord liveth surely they swear falsely 53 o lord are not thine eyes upon the truth thou hast stricken them but they have not grieved thou hast consumed them but they have refused to receive correction they have made their faces harder than a rock they have refused to return 54 therefore i said surely these are poor they are foolish for they know not the way of the lord nor the judgment of their god 55 i will get me unto the great men and will speak unto them for they have known the way of the lord and the judgment of their god but these have altogether broken the yoke and burst the bonds 56 wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them a leopard shall watch over their cities every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces because their transgressions are many and their backslidings are increased 57 how shall i pardon thee for this thy children have forsaken me and sworn by them that are no gods when i had fed them to the full they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots houses 58 they were as fed horses in the morning every one neighed after his neighbours wife 59 shall i not visit for these things saith the lord and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this 510 go ye up upon her walls and destroy but make not a full end take away her battlements for they are not the lords 511 for the house of israel and the house of judah have dealt very treacherously against me saith the lord 512 they have belied the lord and said it is not he neither shall evil come upon us neither shall we see sword nor famine 513 and the prophets shall become wind and the word is not in them thus shall it be done unto them 514 wherefore thus saith the lord god of hosts because ye speak this word behold i will make my words in thy mouth fire and this people wood and it shall devour them 515 lo i will bring a nation upon you from far o house of israel saith the lord it is a mighty nation it is an ancient nation a nation whose language thou knowest not neither understandest what they say 516 their quiver is as an open sepulchre they are all mighty men 517 and they shall eat up thine harvest and thy bread which thy sons and thy daughters should eat they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees they shall impoverish thy fenced cities wherein thou trustedst with the sword 518 nevertheless in those days saith the lord i will not make a full end with you 519 and it shall come to pass when ye shall say wherefore doeth the lord our god all these things unto us then shalt thou answer them like as ye have forsaken me and served strange gods in your land so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours 520 declare this in the house of jacob and publish it in judah saying 521 hear now this o foolish people and without understanding which have eyes and see not which have ears and hear not 522 fear ye not me saith the lord will ye not tremble at my presence which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree that it cannot pass it and though the waves thereof toss themselves yet can they not prevail though they roar yet can they not pass over it 523 but this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart they are revolted and gone 524 neither say they in their heart let us now fear the lord our god that giveth rain both the former and the latter in his season he reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest 525 your iniquities have turned away these things and your sins have withholden good things from you 526 for among my people are found wicked men they lay wait as he that setteth snares they set a trap they catch men 527 as a cage is full of birds so are their houses full of deceit therefore they are become great and waxen rich 528 they are waxen fat they shine yea they overpass the deeds of the wicked they judge not the cause the cause of the fatherless yet they prosper and the right of the needy do they not judge 529 shall i not visit for these things saith the lord shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this 530 a wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land 531 the prophets prophesy falsely and the priests bear rule by their means and my people love to have it so and what will ye do in the end thereof 61 o ye children of benjamin gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of jerusalem and blow the trumpet in tekoa and set up a sign of fire in bethhaccerem for evil appeareth out of the north and great destruction 62 i have likened the daughter of zion to a comely and delicate woman 63 the shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her they shall pitch their tents against her round about they shall feed every one in his place 64 prepare ye war against her arise and let us go up at noon woe unto us for the day goeth away for the shadows of the evening are stretched out 65 arise and let us go by night and let us destroy her palaces 66 for thus hath the lord of hosts said hew ye down trees and cast a mount against jerusalem this is the city to be visited she is wholly oppression in the midst of her 67 as a fountain casteth out her waters so she casteth out her wickedness violence and spoil is heard in her before me continually is grief and wounds 68 be thou instructed o jerusalem lest my soul depart from thee lest i make thee desolate a land not inhabited 69 thus saith the lord of hosts they shall throughly glean the remnant of israel as a vine turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the baskets 610 to whom shall i speak and give warning that they may hear behold their ear is uncircumcised and they cannot hearken behold the word of the lord is unto them a reproach they have no delight in it 611 therefore i am full of the fury of the lord i am weary with holding in i will pour it out upon the children abroad and upon the assembly of young men together for even the husband with the wife shall be taken the aged with him that is full of days 612 and their houses shall be turned unto others with their fields and wives together for i will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land saith the lord 613 for from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely 614 they have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace 615 were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore they shall fall among them that fall at the time that i visit them they shall be cast down saith the lord 616 thus saith the lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and ye shall find rest for your souls but they said we will not walk therein 617 also i set watchmen over you saying hearken to the sound of the trumpet but they said we will not hearken 618 therefore hear ye nations and know o congregation what is among them 619 hear o earth behold i will bring evil upon this people even the fruit of their thoughts because they have not hearkened unto my words nor to my law but rejected it 620 to what purpose cometh there to me incense from sheba and the sweet cane from a far country your burnt offerings are not acceptable nor your sacrifices sweet unto me 621 therefore thus saith the lord behold i will lay stumblingblocks before this people and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them the neighbour and his friend shall perish 622 thus saith the lord behold a people cometh from the north country and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth 623 they shall lay hold on bow and spear they are cruel and have no mercy their voice roareth like the sea and they ride upon horses set in array as men for war against thee o daughter of zion 624 we have heard the fame thereof our hands wax feeble anguish hath taken hold of us and pain as of a woman in travail 625 go not forth into the field nor walk by the way for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side 626 o daughter of my people gird thee with sackcloth and wallow thyself in ashes make thee mourning as for an only son most bitter lamentation for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us 627 i have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people that thou mayest know and try their way 628 they are all grievous revolters walking with slanders they are brass and iron they are all corrupters 629 the bellows are burned the lead is consumed of the fire the founder melteth in vain for the wicked are not plucked away 630 reprobate silver shall men call them because the lord hath rejected them 71 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying 72 stand in the gate of the lords house and proclaim there this word and say hear the word of the lord all ye of judah that enter in at these gates to worship the lord 73 thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel amend your ways and your doings and i will cause you to dwell in this place 74 trust ye not in lying words saying the temple of the lord the temple of the lord the temple of the lord are these 75 for if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings if ye throughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbour 76 if ye oppress not the stranger the fatherless and the widow and shed not innocent blood in this place neither walk after other gods to your hurt 77 then will i cause you to dwell in this place in the land that i gave to your fathers for ever and ever 78 behold ye trust in lying words that cannot profit 79 will ye steal murder and commit adultery and swear falsely and burn incense unto baal and walk after other gods whom ye know not 710 and come and stand before me in this house which is called by my name and say we are delivered to do all these abominations 711 is this house which is called by my name become a den of robbers in your eyes behold even i have seen it saith the lord 712 but go ye now unto my place which was in shiloh where i set my name at the first and see what i did to it for the wickedness of my people israel 713 and now because ye have done all these works saith the lord and i spake unto you rising up early and speaking but ye heard not and i called you but ye answered not 714 therefore will i do unto this house which is called by my name wherein ye trust and unto the place which i gave to you and to your fathers as i have done to shiloh 715 and i will cast you out of my sight as i have cast out all your brethren even the whole seed of ephraim 716 therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up cry nor prayer for them neither make intercession to me for i will not hear thee 717 seest thou not what they do in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem 718 the children gather wood and the fathers kindle the fire and the women knead their dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods that they may provoke me to anger 719 do they provoke me to anger saith the lord do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces 720 therefore thus saith the lord god behold mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place upon man and upon beast and upon the trees of the field and upon the fruit of the ground and it shall burn and shall not be quenched 721 thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices and eat flesh 722 for i spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that i brought them out of the land of egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices 723 but this thing commanded i them saying obey my voice and i will be your god and ye shall be my people and walk ye in all the ways that i have commanded you that it may be well unto you 724 but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart and went backward and not forward 725 since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of egypt unto this day i have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets daily rising up early and sending them 726 yet they hearkened not unto me nor inclined their ear but hardened their neck they did worse than their fathers 727 therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them but they will not hearken to thee thou shalt also call unto them but they will not answer thee 728 but thou shalt say unto them this is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the lord their god nor receiveth correction truth is perished and is cut off from their mouth 729 cut off thine hair o jerusalem and cast it away and take up a lamentation on high places for the lord hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath 730 for the children of judah have done evil in my sight saith the lord they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to pollute it 731 and they have built the high places of tophet which is in the valley of the son of hinnom to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire which i commanded them not neither came it into my heart 732 therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shall no more be called tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter for they shall bury in tophet till there be no place 733 and the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth and none shall fray them away 734 then will i cause to cease from the cities of judah and from the streets of jerusalem the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride for the land shall be desolate 81 at that time saith the lord they shall bring out the bones of the kings of judah and the bones of his princes and the bones of the priests and the bones of the prophets and the bones of the inhabitants of jerusalem out of their graves 82 and they shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven whom they have loved and whom they have served and after whom they have walked and whom they have sought and whom they have worshipped they shall not be gathered nor be buried they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth 83 and death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family which remain in all the places whither i have driven them saith the lord of hosts 84 moreover thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord shall they fall and not arise shall he turn away and not return 85 why then is this people of jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding they hold fast deceit they refuse to return 86 i hearkened and heard but they spake not aright no man repented him of his wickedness saying what have i done every one turned to his course as the horse rusheth into the battle 87 yea the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming but my people know not the judgment of the lord 88 how do ye say we are wise and the law of the lord is with us lo certainly in vain made he it the pen of the scribes is in vain 89 the wise men are ashamed they are dismayed and taken lo they have rejected the word of the lord and what wisdom is in them 810 therefore will i give their wives unto others and their fields to them that shall inherit them for every one from the least even unto the greatest is given to covetousness from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely 811 for they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly saying peace peace when there is no peace 812 were they ashamed when they had committed abomination nay they were not at all ashamed neither could they blush therefore shall they fall among them that fall in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down saith the lord 813 i will surely consume them saith the lord there shall be no grapes on the vine nor figs on the fig tree and the leaf shall fade and the things that i have given them shall pass away from them 814 why do we sit still assemble yourselves and let us enter into the defenced cities and let us be silent there for the lord our god hath put us to silence and given us water of gall to drink because we have sinned against the lord 815 we looked for peace but no good came and for a time of health and behold trouble 816 the snorting of his horses was heard from dan the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones for they are come and have devoured the land and all that is in it the city and those that dwell therein 817 for behold i will send serpents cockatrices among you which will not be charmed and they shall bite you saith the lord 818 when i would comfort myself against sorrow my heart is faint in me 819 behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a far country is not the lord in zion is not her king in her why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images and with strange vanities 820 the harvest is past the summer is ended and we are not saved 821 for the hurt of the daughter of my people am i hurt i am black astonishment hath taken hold on me 822 is there no balm in gilead is there no physician there why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered 91 oh that my head were waters and mine eyes a fountain of tears that i might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people 92 oh that i had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men that i might leave my people and go from them for they be all adulterers an assembly of treacherous men 93 and they bend their tongues like their bow for lies but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth for they proceed from evil to evil and they know not me saith the lord 94 take ye heed every one of his neighbour and trust ye not in any brother for every brother will utterly supplant and every neighbour will walk with slanders 95 and they will deceive every one his neighbour and will not speak the truth they have taught their tongue to speak lies and weary themselves to commit iniquity 96 thine habitation is in the midst of deceit through deceit they refuse to know me saith the lord 97 therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will melt them and try them for how shall i do for the daughter of my people 98 their tongue is as an arrow shot out it speaketh deceit one speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth but in heart he layeth his wait 99 shall i not visit them for these things saith the lord shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this 910 for the mountains will i take up a weeping and wailing and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation because they are burned up so that none can pass through them neither can men hear the voice of the cattle both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled they are gone 911 and i will make jerusalem heaps and a den of dragons and i will make the cities of judah desolate without an inhabitant 912 who is the wise man that may understand this and who is he to whom the mouth of the lord hath spoken that he may declare it for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness that none passeth through 913 and the lord saith because they have forsaken my law which i set before them and have not obeyed my voice neither walked therein 914 but have walked after the imagination of their own heart and after baalim which their fathers taught them 915 therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will feed them even this people with wormwood and give them water of gall to drink 916 i will scatter them also among the heathen whom neither they nor their fathers have known and i will send a sword after them till i have consumed them 917 thus saith the lord of hosts consider ye and call for the mourning women that they may come and send for cunning women that they may come 918 and let them make haste and take up a wailing for us that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush out with waters 919 for a voice of wailing is heard out of zion how are we spoiled we are greatly confounded because we have forsaken the land because our dwellings have cast us out 920 yet hear the word of the lord o ye women and let your ear receive the word of his mouth and teach your daughters wailing and every one her neighbour lamentation 921 for death is come up into our windows and is entered into our palaces to cut off the children from without and the young men from the streets 922 speak thus saith the lord even the carcases of men shall fall as dung upon the open field and as the handful after the harvestman and none shall gather them 923 thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches 924 but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me that i am the lord which exercise lovingkindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these things i delight saith the lord 925 behold the days come saith the lord that i will punish all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised 926 egypt and judah and edom and the children of ammon and moab and all that are in the utmost corners that dwell in the wilderness for all these nations are uncircumcised and all the house of israel are uncircumcised in the heart 101 hear ye the word which the lord speaketh unto you o house of israel 102 thus saith the lord learn not the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen are dismayed at them 103 for the customs of the people are vain for one cutteth a tree out of the forest the work of the hands of the workman with the axe 104 they deck it with silver and with gold they fasten it with nails and with hammers that it move not 105 they are upright as the palm tree but speak not they must needs be borne because they cannot go be not afraid of them for they cannot do evil neither also is it in them to do good 106 forasmuch as there is none like unto thee o lord thou art great and thy name is great in might 107 who would not fear thee o king of nations for to thee doth it appertain forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is none like unto thee 108 but they are altogether brutish and foolish the stock is a doctrine of vanities 109 silver spread into plates is brought from tarshish and gold from uphaz the work of the workman and of the hands of the founder blue and purple is their clothing they are all the work of cunning men 1010 but the lord is the true god he is the living god and an everlasting king at his wrath the earth shall tremble and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation 1011 thus shall ye say unto them the gods that have not made the heavens and the earth even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens 1012 he hath made the earth by his power he hath established the world by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion 1013 when he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures 1014 every man is brutish in his knowledge every founder is confounded by the graven image for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in them 1015 they are vanity and the work of errors in the time of their visitation they shall perish 1016 the portion of jacob is not like them for he is the former of all things and israel is the rod of his inheritance the lord of hosts is his name 1017 gather up thy wares out of the land o inhabitant of the fortress 1018 for thus saith the lord behold i will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once and will distress them that they may find it so 1019 woe is me for my hurt my wound is grievous but i said truly this is a grief and i must bear it 1020 my tabernacle is spoiled and all my cords are broken my children are gone forth of me and they are not there is none to stretch forth my tent any more and to set up my curtains 1021 for the pastors are become brutish and have not sought the lord therefore they shall not prosper and all their flocks shall be scattered 1022 behold the noise of the bruit is come and a great commotion out of the north country to make the cities of judah desolate and a den of dragons 1023 o lord i know that the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps 1024 o lord correct me but with judgment not in thine anger lest thou bring me to nothing 1025 pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not and upon the families that call not on thy name for they have eaten up jacob and devoured him and consumed him and have made his habitation desolate 111 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying 112 hear ye the words of this covenant and speak unto the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem 113 and say thou unto them thus saith the lord god of israel cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant 114 which i commanded your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt from the iron furnace saying obey my voice and do them according to all which i command you so shall ye be my people and i will be your god 115 that i may perform the oath which i have sworn unto your fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey as it is this day then answered i and said so be it o lord 116 then the lord said unto me proclaim all these words in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem saying hear ye the words of this covenant and do them 117 for i earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that i brought them up out of the land of egypt even unto this day rising early and protesting saying obey my voice 118 yet they obeyed not nor inclined their ear but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart therefore i will bring upon them all the words of this covenant which i commanded them to do but they did them not 119 and the lord said unto me a conspiracy is found among the men of judah and among the inhabitants of jerusalem 1110 they are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers which refused to hear my words and they went after other gods to serve them the house of israel and the house of judah have broken my covenant which i made with their fathers 1111 therefore thus saith the lord behold i will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to escape and though they shall cry unto me i will not hearken unto them 1112 then shall the cities of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble 1113 for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods o judah and according to the number of the streets of jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing even altars to burn incense unto baal 1114 therefore pray not thou for this people neither lift up a cry or prayer for them for i will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble 1115 what hath my beloved to do in mine house seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many and the holy flesh is passed from thee when thou doest evil then thou rejoicest 1116 the lord called thy name a green olive tree fair and of goodly fruit with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it and the branches of it are broken 1117 for the lord of hosts that planted thee hath pronounced evil against thee for the evil of the house of israel and of the house of judah which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto baal 1118 and the lord hath given me knowledge of it and i know it then thou shewedst me their doings 1119 but i was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter and i knew not that they had devised devices against me saying let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof and let us cut him off from the land of the living that his name may be no more remembered 1120 but o lord of hosts that judgest righteously that triest the reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have i revealed my cause 1121 therefore thus saith the lord of the men of anathoth that seek thy life saying prophesy not in the name of the lord that thou die not by our hand 1122 therefore thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will punish them the young men shall die by the sword their sons and their daughters shall die by famine 1123 and there shall be no remnant of them for i will bring evil upon the men of anathoth even the year of their visitation 121 righteous art thou o lord when i plead with thee yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherously 122 thou hast planted them yea they have taken root they grow yea they bring forth fruit thou art near in their mouth and far from their reins 123 but thou o lord knowest me thou hast seen me and tried mine heart toward thee pull them out like sheep for the slaughter and prepare them for the day of slaughter 124 how long shall the land mourn and the herbs of every field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein the beasts are consumed and the birds because they said he shall not see our last end 125 if thou hast run with the footmen and they have wearied thee then how canst thou contend with horses and if in the land of peace wherein thou trustedst they wearied thee then how wilt thou do in the swelling of jordan 126 for even thy brethren and the house of thy father even they have dealt treacherously with thee yea they have called a multitude after thee believe them not though they speak fair words unto thee 127 i have forsaken mine house i have left mine heritage i have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies 128 mine heritage is unto me as a lion in the forest it crieth out against me therefore have i hated it 129 mine heritage is unto me as a speckled bird the birds round about are against her come ye assemble all the beasts of the field come to devour 1210 many pastors have destroyed my vineyard they have trodden my portion under foot they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness 1211 they have made it desolate and being desolate it mourneth unto me the whole land is made desolate because no man layeth it to heart 1212 the spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness for the sword of the lord shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land no flesh shall have peace 1213 they have sown wheat but shall reap thorns they have put themselves to pain but shall not profit and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the lord 1214 thus saith the lord against all mine evil neighbours that touch the inheritance which i have caused my people israel to inherit behold i will pluck them out of their land and pluck out the house of judah from among them 1215 and it shall come to pass after that i have plucked them out i will return and have compassion on them and will bring them again every man to his heritage and every man to his land 1216 and it shall come to pass if they will diligently learn the ways of my people to swear by my name the lord liveth as they taught my people to swear by baal then shall they be built in the midst of my people 1217 but if they will not obey i will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation saith the lord 131 thus saith the lord unto me go and get thee a linen girdle and put it upon thy loins and put it not in water 132 so i got a girdle according to the word of the lord and put it on my loins 133 and the word of the lord came unto me the second time saying 134 take the girdle that thou hast got which is upon thy loins and arise go to euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the rock 135 so i went and hid it by euphrates as the lord commanded me 136 and it came to pass after many days that the lord said unto me arise go to euphrates and take the girdle from thence which i commanded thee to hide there 137 then i went to euphrates and digged and took the girdle from the place where i had hid it and behold the girdle was marred it was profitable for nothing 138 then the word of the lord came unto me saying 139 thus saith the lord after this manner will i mar the pride of judah and the great pride of jerusalem 1310 this evil people which refuse to hear my words which walk in the imagination of their heart and walk after other gods to serve them and to worship them shall even be as this girdle which is good for nothing 1311 for as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man so have i caused to cleave unto me the whole house of israel and the whole house of judah saith the lord that they might be unto me for a people and for a name and for a praise and for a glory but they would not hear 1312 therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word thus saith the lord god of israel every bottle shall be filled with wine and they shall say unto thee do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine 1313 then shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord behold i will fill all the inhabitants of this land even the kings that sit upon davids throne and the priests and the prophets and all the inhabitants of jerusalem with drunkenness 1314 and i will dash them one against another even the fathers and the sons together saith the lord i will not pity nor spare nor have mercy but destroy them 1315 hear ye and give ear be not proud for the lord hath spoken 1316 give glory to the lord your god before he cause darkness and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains and while ye look for light he turn it into the shadow of death and make it gross darkness 1317 but if ye will not hear it my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride and mine eye shall weep sore and run down with tears because the lords flock is carried away captive 1318 say unto the king and to the queen humble yourselves sit down for your principalities shall come down even the crown of your glory 1319 the cities of the south shall be shut up and none shall open them judah shall be carried away captive all of it it shall be wholly carried away captive 1320 lift up your eyes and behold them that come from the north where is the flock that was given thee thy beautiful flock 1321 what wilt thou say when he shall punish thee for thou hast taught them to be captains and as chief over thee shall not sorrows take thee as a woman in travail 1322 and if thou say in thine heart wherefore come these things upon me for the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered and thy heels made bare 1323 can the ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots then may ye also do good that are accustomed to do evil 1324 therefore will i scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness 1325 this is thy lot the portion of thy measures from me saith the lord because thou hast forgotten me and trusted in falsehood 1326 therefore will i discover thy skirts upon thy face that thy shame may appear 1327 i have seen thine adulteries and thy neighings the lewdness of thy whoredom and thine abominations on the hills in the fields woe unto thee o jerusalem wilt thou not be made clean when shall it once be 141 the word of the lord that came to jeremiah concerning the dearth 142 judah mourneth and the gates thereof languish they are black unto the ground and the cry of jerusalem is gone up 143 and their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters they came to the pits and found no water they returned with their vessels empty they were ashamed and confounded and covered their heads 144 because the ground is chapt for there was no rain in the earth the plowmen were ashamed they covered their heads 145 yea the hind also calved in the field and forsook it because there was no grass 146 and the wild asses did stand in the high places they snuffed up the wind like dragons their eyes did fail because there was no grass 147 o lord though our iniquities testify against us do thou it for thy names sake for our backslidings are many we have sinned against thee 148 o the hope of israel the saviour thereof in time of trouble why shouldest thou be as a stranger in the land and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night 149 why shouldest thou be as a man astonied as a mighty man that cannot save yet thou o lord art in the midst of us and we are called by thy name leave us not 1410 thus saith the lord unto this people thus have they loved to wander they have not refrained their feet therefore the lord doth not accept them he will now remember their iniquity and visit their sins 1411 then said the lord unto me pray not for this people for their good 1412 when they fast i will not hear their cry and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation i will not accept them but i will consume them by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence 1413 then said i ah lord god behold the prophets say unto them ye shall not see the sword neither shall ye have famine but i will give you assured peace in this place 1414 then the lord said unto me the prophets prophesy lies in my name i sent them not neither have i commanded them neither spake unto them they prophesy unto you a false vision and divination and a thing of nought and the deceit of their heart 1415 therefore thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name and i sent them not yet they say sword and famine shall not be in this land by sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed 1416 and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of jerusalem because of the famine and the sword and they shall have none to bury them them their wives nor their sons nor their daughters for i will pour their wickedness upon them 1417 therefore thou shalt say this word unto them let mine eyes run down with tears night and day and let them not cease for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach with a very grievous blow 1418 if i go forth into the field then behold the slain with the sword and if i enter into the city then behold them that are sick with famine yea both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not 1419 hast thou utterly rejected judah hath thy soul lothed zion why hast thou smitten us and there is no healing for us we looked for peace and there is no good and for the time of healing and behold trouble 1420 we acknowledge o lord our wickedness and the iniquity of our fathers for we have sinned against thee 1421 do not abhor us for thy names sake do not disgrace the throne of thy glory remember break not thy covenant with us 1422 are there any among the vanities of the gentiles that can cause rain or can the heavens give showers art not thou he o lord our god therefore we will wait upon thee for thou hast made all these things 151 then said the lord unto me though moses and samuel stood before me yet my mind could not be toward this people cast them out of my sight and let them go forth 152 and it shall come to pass if they say unto thee whither shall we go forth then thou shalt tell them thus saith the lord such as are for death to death and such as are for the sword to the sword and such as are for the famine to the famine and such as are for the captivity to the captivity 153 and i will appoint over them four kinds saith the lord the sword to slay and the dogs to tear and the fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy 154 and i will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth because of manasseh the son of hezekiah king of judah for that which he did in jerusalem 155 for who shall have pity upon thee o jerusalem or who shall bemoan thee or who shall go aside to ask how thou doest 156 thou hast forsaken me saith the lord thou art gone backward therefore will i stretch out my hand against thee and destroy thee i am weary with repenting 157 and i will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land i will bereave them of children i will destroy my people since they return not from their ways 158 their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas i have brought upon them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday i have caused him to fall upon it suddenly and terrors upon the city 159 she that hath borne seven languisheth she hath given up the ghost her sun is gone down while it was yet day she hath been ashamed and confounded and the residue of them will i deliver to the sword before their enemies saith the lord 1510 woe is me my mother that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth i have neither lent on usury nor men have lent to me on usury yet every one of them doth curse me 1511 the lord said verily it shall be well with thy remnant verily i will cause the enemy to entreat thee well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction 1512 shall iron break the northern iron and the steel 1513 thy substance and thy treasures will i give to the spoil without price and that for all thy sins even in all thy borders 1514 and i will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not for a fire is kindled in mine anger which shall burn upon you 1515 o lord thou knowest remember me and visit me and revenge me of my persecutors take me not away in thy longsuffering know that for thy sake i have suffered rebuke 1516 thy words were found and i did eat them and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart for i am called by thy name o lord god of hosts 1517 i sat not in the assembly of the mockers nor rejoiced i sat alone because of thy hand for thou hast filled me with indignation 1518 why is my pain perpetual and my wound incurable which refuseth to be healed wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar and as waters that fail 1519 therefore thus saith the lord if thou return then will i bring thee again and thou shalt stand before me and if thou take forth the precious from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth let them return unto thee but return not thou unto them 1520 and i will make thee unto this people a fenced brasen wall and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee for i am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee saith the lord 1521 and i will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked and i will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible 161 the word of the lord came also unto me saying 162 thou shalt not take thee a wife neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place 163 for thus saith the lord concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place and concerning their mothers that bare them and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land 164 they shall die of grievous deaths they shall not be lamented neither shall they be buried but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth and they shall be consumed by the sword and by famine and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven and for the beasts of the earth 165 for thus saith the lord enter not into the house of mourning neither go to lament nor bemoan them for i have taken away my peace from this people saith the lord even lovingkindness and mercies 166 both the great and the small shall die in this land they shall not be buried neither shall men lament for them nor cut themselves nor make themselves bald for them 167 neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning to comfort them for the dead neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother 168 thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting to sit with them to eat and to drink 169 for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes and in your days the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride 1610 and it shall come to pass when thou shalt shew this people all these words and they shall say unto thee wherefore hath the lord pronounced all this great evil against us or what is our iniquity or what is our sin that we have committed against the lord our god 1611 then shalt thou say unto them because your fathers have forsaken me saith the lord and have walked after other gods and have served them and have worshipped them and have forsaken me and have not kept my law 1612 and ye have done worse than your fathers for behold ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart that they may not hearken unto me 1613 therefore will i cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not neither ye nor your fathers and there shall ye serve other gods day and night where i will not shew you favour 1614 therefore behold the days come saith the lord that it shall no more be said the lord liveth that brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt 1615 but the lord liveth that brought up the children of israel from the land of the north and from all the lands whither he had driven them and i will bring them again into their land that i gave unto their fathers 1616 behold i will send for many fishers saith the lord and they shall fish them and after will i send for many hunters and they shall hunt them from every mountain and from every hill and out of the holes of the rocks 1617 for mine eyes are upon all their ways they are not hid from my face neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes 1618 and first i will recompense their iniquity and their sin double because they have defiled my land they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things 1619 o lord my strength and my fortress and my refuge in the day of affliction the gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth and shall say surely our fathers have inherited lies vanity and things wherein there is no profit 1620 shall a man make gods unto himself and they are no gods 1621 therefore behold i will this once cause them to know i will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my name is the lord 171 the sin of judah is written with a pen of iron and with the point of a diamond it is graven upon the table of their heart and upon the horns of your altars 172 whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees upon the high hills 173 o my mountain in the field i will give thy substance and all thy treasures to the spoil and thy high places for sin throughout all thy borders 174 and thou even thyself shalt discontinue from thine heritage that i gave thee and i will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou knowest not for ye have kindled a fire in mine anger which shall burn for ever 175 thus saith the lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departeth from the lord 176 for he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabited 177 blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope the lord is 178 for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters and that spreadeth out her roots by the river and shall not see when heat cometh but her leaf shall be green and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit 179 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it 1710 i the lord search the heart i try the reins even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings 1711 as the partridge sitteth on eggs and hatcheth them not so he that getteth riches and not by right shall leave them in the midst of his days and at his end shall be a fool 1712 a glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary 1713 o lord the hope of israel all that forsake thee shall be ashamed and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth because they have forsaken the lord the fountain of living waters 1714 heal me o lord and i shall be healed save me and i shall be saved for thou art my praise 1715 behold they say unto me where is the word of the lord let it come now 1716 as for me i have not hastened from being a pastor to follow thee neither have i desired the woeful day thou knowest that which came out of my lips was right before thee 1717 be not a terror unto me thou art my hope in the day of evil 1718 let them be confounded that persecute me but let not me be confounded let them be dismayed but let not me be dismayed bring upon them the day of evil and destroy them with double destruction 1719 thus said the lord unto me go and stand in the gate of the children of the people whereby the kings of judah come in and by the which they go out and in all the gates of jerusalem 1720 and say unto them hear ye the word of the lord ye kings of judah and all judah and all the inhabitants of jerusalem that enter in by these gates 1721 thus saith the lord take heed to yourselves and bear no burden on the sabbath day nor bring it in by the gates of jerusalem 1722 neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day neither do ye any work but hallow ye the sabbath day as i commanded your fathers 1723 but they obeyed not neither inclined their ear but made their neck stiff that they might not hear nor receive instruction 1724 and it shall come to pass if ye diligently hearken unto me saith the lord to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day but hallow the sabbath day to do no work therein 1725 then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of david riding in chariots and on horses they and their princes the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem and this city shall remain for ever 1726 and they shall come from the cities of judah and from the places about jerusalem and from the land of benjamin and from the plain and from the mountains and from the south bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices and meat offerings and incense and bringing sacrifices of praise unto the house of the lord 1727 but if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day and not to bear a burden even entering in at the gates of jerusalem on the sabbath day then will i kindle a fire in the gates thereof and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem and it shall not be quenched 181 the word which came to jeremiah from the lord saying 182 arise and go down to the potters house and there i will cause thee to hear my words 183 then i went down to the potters house and behold he wrought a work on the wheels 184 and the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter so he made it again another vessel as seemed good to the potter to make it 185 then the word of the lord came to me saying 186 o house of israel cannot i do with you as this potter saith the lord behold as the clay is in the potters hand so are ye in mine hand o house of israel 187 at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it 188 if that nation against whom i have pronounced turn from their evil i will repent of the evil that i thought to do unto them 189 and at what instant i shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it 1810 if it do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice then i will repent of the good wherewith i said i would benefit them 1811 now therefore go to speak to the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem saying thus saith the lord behold i frame evil against you and devise a device against you return ye now every one from his evil way and make your ways and your doings good 1812 and they said there is no hope but we will walk after our own devices and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart 1813 therefore thus saith the lord ask ye now among the heathen who hath heard such things the virgin of israel hath done a very horrible thing 1814 will a man leave the snow of lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken 1815 because my people hath forgotten me they have burned incense to vanity and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths to walk in paths in a way not cast up 1816 to make their land desolate and a perpetual hissing every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and wag his head 1817 i will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy i will shew them the back and not the face in the day of their calamity 1818 then said they come and let us devise devices against jeremiah for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet come and let us smite him with the tongue and let us not give heed to any of his words 1819 give heed to me o lord and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me 1820 shall evil be recompensed for good for they have digged a pit for my soul remember that i stood before thee to speak good for them and to turn away thy wrath from them 1821 therefore deliver up their children to the famine and pour out their blood by the force of the sword and let their wives be bereaved of their children and be widows and let their men be put to death let their young men be slain by the sword in battle 1822 let a cry be heard from their houses when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them for they have digged a pit to take me and hid snares for my feet 1823 yet lord thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me forgive not their iniquity neither blot out their sin from thy sight but let them be overthrown before thee deal thus with them in the time of thine anger 191 thus saith the lord go and get a potters earthen bottle and take of the ancients of the people and of the ancients of the priests 192 and go forth unto the valley of the son of hinnom which is by the entry of the east gate and proclaim there the words that i shall tell thee 193 and say hear ye the word of the lord o kings of judah and inhabitants of jerusalem thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring evil upon this place the which whosoever heareth his ears shall tingle 194 because they have forsaken me and have estranged this place and have burned incense in it unto other gods whom neither they nor their fathers have known nor the kings of judah and have filled this place with the blood of innocents 195 they have built also the high places of baal to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto baal which i commanded not nor spake it neither came it into my mind 196 therefore behold the days come saith the lord that this place shall no more be called tophet nor the valley of the son of hinnom but the valley of slaughter 197 and i will make void the counsel of judah and jerusalem in this place and i will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of them that seek their lives and their carcases will i give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth 198 and i will make this city desolate and an hissing every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof 199 and i will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness wherewith their enemies and they that seek their lives shall straiten them 1910 then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee 1911 and shalt say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts even so will i break this people and this city as one breaketh a potters vessel that cannot be made whole again and they shall bury them in tophet till there be no place to bury 1912 thus will i do unto this place saith the lord and to the inhabitants thereof and even make this city as tophet 1913 and the houses of jerusalem and the houses of the kings of judah shall be defiled as the place of tophet because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of heaven and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods 1914 then came jeremiah from tophet whither the lord had sent him to prophesy and he stood in the court of the lords house and said to all the people 1915 thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that i have pronounced against it because they have hardened their necks that they might not hear my words 201 now pashur the son of immer the priest who was also chief governor in the house of the lord heard that jeremiah prophesied these things 202 then pashur smote jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of benjamin which was by the house of the lord 203 and it came to pass on the morrow that pashur brought forth jeremiah out of the stocks then said jeremiah unto him the lord hath not called thy name pashur but magormissabib 204 for thus saith the lord behold i will make thee a terror to thyself and to all thy friends and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies and thine eyes shall behold it and i will give all judah into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall carry them captive into babylon and shall slay them with the sword 205 moreover i will deliver all the strength of this city and all the labours thereof and all the precious things thereof and all the treasures of the kings of judah will i give into the hand of their enemies which shall spoil them and take them and carry them to babylon 206 and thou pashur and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity and thou shalt come to babylon and there thou shalt die and shalt be buried there thou and all thy friends to whom thou hast prophesied lies 207 o lord thou hast deceived me and i was deceived thou art stronger than i and hast prevailed i am in derision daily every one mocketh me 208 for since i spake i cried out i cried violence and spoil because the word of the lord was made a reproach unto me and a derision daily 209 then i said i will not make mention of him nor speak any more in his name but his word was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones and i was weary with forbearing and i could not stay 2010 for i heard the defaming of many fear on every side report say they and we will report it all my familiars watched for my halting saying peradventure he will be enticed and we shall prevail against him and we shall take our revenge on him 2011 but the lord is with me as a mighty terrible one therefore my persecutors shall stumble and they shall not prevail they shall be greatly ashamed for they shall not prosper their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten 2012 but o lord of hosts that triest the righteous and seest the reins and the heart let me see thy vengeance on them for unto thee have i opened my cause 2013 sing unto the lord praise ye the lord for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers 2014 cursed be the day wherein i was born let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed 2015 cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father saying a man child is born unto thee making him very glad 2016 and let that man be as the cities which the lord overthrew and repented not and let him hear the cry in the morning and the shouting at noontide 2017 because he slew me not from the womb or that my mother might have been my grave and her womb to be always great with me 2018 wherefore came i forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow that my days should be consumed with shame 211 the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when king zedekiah sent unto him pashur the son of melchiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest saying 212 enquire i pray thee of the lord for us for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon maketh war against us if so be that the lord will deal with us according to all his wondrous works that he may go up from us 213 then said jeremiah unto them thus shall ye say to zedekiah 214 thus saith the lord god of israel behold i will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands wherewith ye fight against the king of babylon and against the chaldeans which besiege you without the walls and i will assemble them into the midst of this city 215 and i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm even in anger and in fury and in great wrath 216 and i will smite the inhabitants of this city both man and beast they shall die of a great pestilence 217 and afterward saith the lord i will deliver zedekiah king of judah and his servants and the people and such as are left in this city from the pestilence from the sword and from the famine into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those that seek their life and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword he shall not spare them neither have pity nor have mercy 218 and unto this people thou shalt say thus saith the lord behold i set before you the way of life and the way of death 219 he that abideth in this city shall die by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth out and falleth to the chaldeans that besiege you he shall live and his life shall be unto him for a prey 2110 for i have set my face against this city for evil and not for good saith the lord it shall be given into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire 2111 and touching the house of the king of judah say hear ye the word of the lord 2112 o house of david thus saith the lord execute judgment in the morning and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor lest my fury go out like fire and burn that none can quench it because of the evil of your doings 2113 behold i am against thee o inhabitant of the valley and rock of the plain saith the lord which say who shall come down against us or who shall enter into our habitations 2114 but i will punish you according to the fruit of your doings saith the lord and i will kindle a fire in the forest thereof and it shall devour all things round about it 221 thus saith the lord go down to the house of the king of judah and speak there this word 222 and say hear the word of the lord o king of judah that sittest upon the throne of david thou and thy servants and thy people that enter in by these gates 223 thus saith the lord execute ye judgment and righteousness and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor and do no wrong do no violence to the stranger the fatherless nor the widow neither shed innocent blood in this place 224 for if ye do this thing indeed then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of david riding in chariots and on horses he and his servants and his people 225 but if ye will not hear these words i swear by myself saith the lord that this house shall become a desolation 226 for thus saith the lord unto the kings house of judah thou art gilead unto me and the head of lebanon yet surely i will make thee a wilderness and cities which are not inhabited 227 and i will prepare destroyers against thee every one with his weapons and they shall cut down thy choice cedars and cast them into the fire 228 and many nations shall pass by this city and they shall say every man to his neighbour wherefore hath the lord done thus unto this great city 229 then they shall answer because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord their god and worshipped other gods and served them 2210 weep ye not for the dead neither bemoan him but weep sore for him that goeth away for he shall return no more nor see his native country 2211 for thus saith the lord touching shallum the son of josiah king of judah which reigned instead of josiah his father which went forth out of this place he shall not return thither any more 2212 but he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive and shall see this land no more 2213 woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his chambers by wrong that useth his neighbours service without wages and giveth him not for his work 2214 that saith i will build me a wide house and large chambers and cutteth him out windows and it is cieled with cedar and painted with vermilion 2215 shalt thou reign because thou closest thyself in cedar did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice and then it was well with him 2216 he judged the cause of the poor and needy then it was well with him was not this to know me saith the lord 2217 but thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness and for to shed innocent blood and for oppression and for violence to do it 2218 therefore thus saith the lord concerning jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah they shall not lament for him saying ah my brother or ah sister they shall not lament for him saying ah lord or ah his glory 2219 he shall be buried with the burial of an ass drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of jerusalem 2220 go up to lebanon and cry and lift up thy voice in bashan and cry from the passages for all thy lovers are destroyed 2221 i spake unto thee in thy prosperity but thou saidst i will not hear this hath been thy manner from thy youth that thou obeyedst not my voice 2222 the wind shall eat up all thy pastors and thy lovers shall go into captivity surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness 2223 o inhabitant of lebanon that makest thy nest in the cedars how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee the pain as of a woman in travail 2224 as i live saith the lord though coniah the son of jehoiakim king of judah were the signet upon my right hand yet would i pluck thee thence 2225 and i will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest even into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of the chaldeans 2226 and i will cast thee out and thy mother that bare thee into another country where ye were not born and there shall ye die 2227 but to the land whereunto they desire to return thither shall they not return 2228 is this man coniah a despised broken idol is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure wherefore are they cast out he and his seed and are cast into a land which they know not 2229 o earth earth earth hear the word of the lord 2230 thus saith the lord write ye this man childless a man that shall not prosper in his days for no man of his seed shall prosper sitting upon the throne of david and ruling any more in judah 231 woe be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture saith the lord 232 therefore thus saith the lord god of israel against the pastors that feed my people ye have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not visited them behold i will visit upon you the evil of your doings saith the lord 233 and i will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither i have driven them and will bring them again to their folds and they shall be fruitful and increase 234 and i will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be lacking saith the lord 235 behold the days come saith the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth 236 in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness 237 therefore behold the days come saith the lord that they shall no more say the lord liveth which brought up the children of israel out of the land of egypt 238 but the lord liveth which brought up and which led the seed of the house of israel out of the north country and from all countries whither i had driven them and they shall dwell in their own land 239 mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets all my bones shake i am like a drunken man and like a man whom wine hath overcome because of the lord and because of the words of his holiness 2310 for the land is full of adulterers for because of swearing the land mourneth the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up and their course is evil and their force is not right 2311 for both prophet and priest are profane yea in my house have i found their wickedness saith the lord 2312 wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness they shall be driven on and fall therein for i will bring evil upon them even the year of their visitation saith the lord 2313 and i have seen folly in the prophets of samaria they prophesied in baal and caused my people israel to err 2314 i have seen also in the prophets of jerusalem an horrible thing they commit adultery and walk in lies they strengthen also the hands of evildoers that none doth return from his wickedness they are all of them unto me as sodom and the inhabitants thereof as gomorrah 2315 therefore thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the prophets behold i will feed them with wormwood and make them drink the water of gall for from the prophets of jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land 2316 thus saith the lord of hosts hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you they make you vain they speak a vision of their own heart and not out of the mouth of the lord 2317 they say still unto them that despise me the lord hath said ye shall have peace and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart no evil shall come upon you 2318 for who hath stood in the counsel of the lord and hath perceived and heard his word who hath marked his word and heard it 2319 behold a whirlwind of the lord is gone forth in fury even a grievous whirlwind it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked 2320 the anger of the lord shall not return until he have executed and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly 2321 i have not sent these prophets yet they ran i have not spoken to them yet they prophesied 2322 but if they had stood in my counsel and had caused my people to hear my words then they should have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their doings 2323 am i a god at hand saith the lord and not a god afar off 2324 can any hide himself in secret places that i shall not see him saith the lord do not i fill heaven and earth saith the lord 2325 i have heard what the prophets said that prophesy lies in my name saying i have dreamed i have dreamed 2326 how long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies yea they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart 2327 which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour as their fathers have forgotten my name for baal 2328 the prophet that hath a dream let him tell a dream and he that hath my word let him speak my word faithfully what is the chaff to the wheat saith the lord 2329 is not my word like as a fire saith the lord and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces 2330 therefore behold i am against the prophets saith the lord that steal my words every one from his neighbour 2331 behold i am against the prophets saith the lord that use their tongues and say he saith 2332 behold i am against them that prophesy false dreams saith the lord and do tell them and cause my people to err by their lies and by their lightness yet i sent them not nor commanded them therefore they shall not profit this people at all saith the lord 2333 and when this people or the prophet or a priest shall ask thee saying what is the burden of the lord thou shalt then say unto them what burden i will even forsake you saith the lord 2334 and as for the prophet and the priest and the people that shall say the burden of the lord i will even punish that man and his house 2335 thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour and every one to his brother what hath the lord answered and what hath the lord spoken 2336 and the burden of the lord shall ye mention no more for every mans word shall be his burden for ye have perverted the words of the living god of the lord of hosts our god 2337 thus shalt thou say to the prophet what hath the lord answered thee and what hath the lord spoken 2338 but since ye say the burden of the lord therefore thus saith the lord because ye say this word the burden of the lord and i have sent unto you saying ye shall not say the burden of the lord 2339 therefore behold i even i will utterly forget you and i will forsake you and the city that i gave you and your fathers and cast you out of my presence 2340 and i will bring an everlasting reproach upon you and a perpetual shame which shall not be forgotten 241 the lord shewed me and behold two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the lord after that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon had carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah and the princes of judah with the carpenters and smiths from jerusalem and had brought them to babylon 242 one basket had very good figs even like the figs that are first ripe and the other basket had very naughty figs which could not be eaten they were so bad 243 then said the lord unto me what seest thou jeremiah and i said figs the good figs very good and the evil very evil that cannot be eaten they are so evil 244 again the word of the lord came unto me saying 245 thus saith the lord the god of israel like these good figs so will i acknowledge them that are carried away captive of judah whom i have sent out of this place into the land of the chaldeans for their good 246 for i will set mine eyes upon them for good and i will bring them again to this land and i will build them and not pull them down and i will plant them and not pluck them up 247 and i will give them an heart to know me that i am the lord and they shall be my people and i will be their god for they shall return unto me with their whole heart 248 and as the evil figs which cannot be eaten they are so evil surely thus saith the lord so will i give zedekiah the king of judah and his princes and the residue of jerusalem that remain in this land and them that dwell in the land of egypt 249 and i will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt to be a reproach and a proverb a taunt and a curse in all places whither i shall drive them 2410 and i will send the sword the famine and the pestilence among them till they be consumed from off the land that i gave unto them and to their fathers 251 the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the people of judah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that was the first year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon 252 the which jeremiah the prophet spake unto all the people of judah and to all the inhabitants of jerusalem saying 253 from the thirteenth year of josiah the son of amon king of judah even unto this day that is the three and twentieth year the word of the lord hath come unto me and i have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye have not hearkened 254 and the lord hath sent unto you all his servants the prophets rising early and sending them but ye have not hearkened nor inclined your ear to hear 255 they said turn ye again now every one from his evil way and from the evil of your doings and dwell in the land that the lord hath given unto you and to your fathers for ever and ever 256 and go not after other gods to serve them and to worship them and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands and i will do you no hurt 257 yet ye have not hearkened unto me saith the lord that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt 258 therefore thus saith the lord of hosts because ye have not heard my words 259 behold i will send and take all the families of the north saith the lord and nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will bring them against this land and against the inhabitants thereof and against all these nations round about and will utterly destroy them and make them an astonishment and an hissing and perpetual desolations 2510 moreover i will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the sound of the millstones and the light of the candle 2511 and this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment and these nations shall serve the king of babylon seventy years 2512 and it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished that i will punish the king of babylon and that nation saith the lord for their iniquity and the land of the chaldeans and will make it perpetual desolations 2513 and i will bring upon that land all my words which i have pronounced against it even all that is written in this book which jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations 2514 for many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also and i will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands 2515 for thus saith the lord god of israel unto me take the wine cup of this fury at my hand and cause all the nations to whom i send thee to drink it 2516 and they shall drink and be moved and be mad because of the sword that i will send among them 2517 then took i the cup at the lords hand and made all the nations to drink unto whom the lord had sent me 2518 to wit jerusalem and the cities of judah and the kings thereof and the princes thereof to make them a desolation an astonishment an hissing and a curse as it is this day 2519 pharaoh king of egypt and his servants and his princes and all his people 2520 and all the mingled people and all the kings of the land of uz and all the kings of the land of the philistines and ashkelon and azzah and ekron and the remnant of ashdod 2521 edom and moab and the children of ammon 2522 and all the kings of tyrus and all the kings of zidon and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea 2523 dedan and tema and buz and all that are in the utmost corners 2524 and all the kings of arabia and all the kings of the mingled people that dwell in the desert 2525 and all the kings of zimri and all the kings of elam and all the kings of the medes 2526 and all the kings of the north far and near one with another and all the kingdoms of the world which are upon the face of the earth and the king of sheshach shall drink after them 2527 therefore thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel drink ye and be drunken and spue and fall and rise no more because of the sword which i will send among you 2528 and it shall be if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink then shalt thou say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts ye shall certainly drink 2529 for lo i begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name and should ye be utterly unpunished ye shall not be unpunished for i will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth saith the lord of hosts 2530 therefore prophesy thou against them all these words and say unto them the lord shall roar from on high and utter his voice from his holy habitation he shall mightily roar upon his habitation he shall give a shout as they that tread the grapes against all the inhabitants of the earth 2531 a noise shall come even to the ends of the earth for the lord hath a controversy with the nations he will plead with all flesh he will give them that are wicked to the sword saith the lord 2532 thus saith the lord of hosts behold evil shall go forth from nation to nation and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth 2533 and the slain of the lord shall be at that day from one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth they shall not be lamented neither gathered nor buried they shall be dung upon the ground 2534 howl ye shepherds and cry and wallow yourselves in the ashes ye principal of the flock for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel 2535 and the shepherds shall have no way to flee nor the principal of the flock to escape 2536 a voice of the cry of the shepherds and an howling of the principal of the flock shall be heard for the lord hath spoiled their pasture 2537 and the peaceable habitations are cut down because of the fierce anger of the lord 2538 he hath forsaken his covert as the lion for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor and because of his fierce anger 261 in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word from the lord saying 262 thus saith the lord stand in the court of the lords house and speak unto all the cities of judah which come to worship in the lords house all the words that i command thee to speak unto them diminish not a word 263 if so be they will hearken and turn every man from his evil way that i may repent me of the evil which i purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings 264 and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord if ye will not hearken to me to walk in my law which i have set before you 265 to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom i sent unto you both rising up early and sending them but ye have not hearkened 266 then will i make this house like shiloh and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth 267 so the priests and the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the lord 268 now it came to pass when jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the lord had commanded him to speak unto all the people that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him saying thou shalt surely die 269 why hast thou prophesied in the name of the lord saying this house shall be like shiloh and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant and all the people were gathered against jeremiah in the house of the lord 2610 when the princes of judah heard these things then they came up from the kings house unto the house of the lord and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the lords house 2611 then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people saying this man is worthy to die for he hath prophesied against this city as ye have heard with your ears 2612 then spake jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people saying the lord sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard 2613 therefore now amend your ways and your doings and obey the voice of the lord your god and the lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you 2614 as for me behold i am in your hand do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you 2615 but know ye for certain that if ye put me to death ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon the inhabitants thereof for of a truth the lord hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears 2616 then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets this man is not worthy to die for he hath spoken to us in the name of the lord our god 2617 then rose up certain of the elders of the land and spake to all the assembly of the people saying 2618 micah the morasthite prophesied in the days of hezekiah king of judah and spake to all the people of judah saying thus saith the lord of hosts zion shall be plowed like a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest 2619 did hezekiah king of judah and all judah put him at all to death did he not fear the lord and besought the lord and the lord repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them thus might we procure great evil against our souls 2620 and there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the lord urijah the son of shemaiah of kirjathjearim who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of jeremiah 2621 and when jehoiakim the king with all his mighty men and all the princes heard his words the king sought to put him to death but when urijah heard it he was afraid and fled and went into egypt 2622 and jehoiakim the king sent men into egypt namely elnathan the son of achbor and certain men with him into egypt 2623 and they fetched forth urijah out of egypt and brought him unto jehoiakim the king who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people 2624 nevertheless the hand of ahikam the son of shaphan was with jeremiah that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death 271 in the beginning of the reign of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah came this word unto jeremiah from the lord saying 272 thus saith the lord to me make thee bonds and yokes and put them upon thy neck 273 and send them to the king of edom and to the king of moab and to the king of the ammonites and to the king of tyrus and to the king of zidon by the hand of the messengers which come to jerusalem unto zedekiah king of judah 274 and command them to say unto their masters thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel thus shall ye say unto your masters 275 i have made the earth the man and the beast that are upon the ground by my great power and by my outstretched arm and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me 276 and now have i given all these lands into the hand of nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon my servant and the beasts of the field have i given him also to serve him 277 and all nations shall serve him and his son and his sons son until the very time of his land come and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him 278 and it shall come to pass that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon that nation will i punish saith the lord with the sword and with the famine and with the pestilence until i have consumed them by his hand 279 therefore hearken not ye to your prophets nor to your diviners nor to your dreamers nor to your enchanters nor to your sorcerers which speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon 2710 for they prophesy a lie unto you to remove you far from your land and that i should drive you out and ye should perish 2711 but the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him those will i let remain still in their own land saith the lord and they shall till it and dwell therein 2712 i spake also to zedekiah king of judah according to all these words saying bring your necks under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him and his people and live 2713 why will ye die thou and thy people by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence as the lord hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of babylon 2714 therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you saying ye shall not serve the king of babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you 2715 for i have not sent them saith the lord yet they prophesy a lie in my name that i might drive you out and that ye might perish ye and the prophets that prophesy unto you 2716 also i spake to the priests and to all this people saying thus saith the lord hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you saying behold the vessels of the lords house shall now shortly be brought again from babylon for they prophesy a lie unto you 2717 hearken not unto them serve the king of babylon and live wherefore should this city be laid waste 2718 but if they be prophets and if the word of the lord be with them let them now make intercession to the lord of hosts that the vessels which are left in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and at jerusalem go not to babylon 2719 for thus saith the lord of hosts concerning the pillars and concerning the sea and concerning the bases and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city 2720 which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took not when he carried away captive jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah from jerusalem to babylon and all the nobles of judah and jerusalem 2721 yea thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the lord and in the house of the king of judah and of jerusalem 2722 they shall be carried to babylon and there shall they be until the day that i visit them saith the lord then will i bring them up and restore them to this place 281 and it came to pass the same year in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah in the fourth year and in the fifth month that hananiah the son of azur the prophet which was of gibeon spake unto me in the house of the lord in the presence of the priests and of all the people saying 282 thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel saying i have broken the yoke of the king of babylon 283 within two full years will i bring again into this place all the vessels of the lords house that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon took away from this place and carried them to babylon 284 and i will bring again to this place jeconiah the son of jehoiakim king of judah with all the captives of judah that went into babylon saith the lord for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon 285 then the prophet jeremiah said unto the prophet hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the lord 286 even the prophet jeremiah said amen the lord do so the lord perform thy words which thou hast prophesied to bring again the vessels of the lords house and all that is carried away captive from babylon into this place 287 nevertheless hear thou now this word that i speak in thine ears and in the ears of all the people 288 the prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries and against great kingdoms of war and of evil and of pestilence 289 the prophet which prophesieth of peace when the word of the prophet shall come to pass then shall the prophet be known that the lord hath truly sent him 2810 then hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet jeremiahs neck and brake it 2811 and hananiah spake in the presence of all the people saying thus saith the lord even so will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years and the prophet jeremiah went his way 2812 then the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the prophet after that hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet jeremiah saying 2813 go and tell hananiah saying thus saith the lord thou hast broken the yokes of wood but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron 2814 for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel i have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations that they may serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and they shall serve him and i have given him the beasts of the field also 2815 then said the prophet jeremiah unto hananiah the prophet hear now hananiah the lord hath not sent thee but thou makest this people to trust in a lie 2816 therefore thus saith the lord behold i will cast thee from off the face of the earth this year thou shalt die because thou hast taught rebellion against the lord 2817 so hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month 291 now these are the words of the letter that jeremiah the prophet sent from jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives and to the priests and to the prophets and to all the people whom nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from jerusalem to babylon 292 after that jeconiah the king and the queen and the eunuchs the princes of judah and jerusalem and the carpenters and the smiths were departed from jerusalem 293 by the hand of elasah the son of shaphan and gemariah the son of hilkiah whom zedekiah king of judah sent unto babylon to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon saying 294 thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel unto all that are carried away captives whom i have caused to be carried away from jerusalem unto babylon 295 build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them 296 take ye wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that ye may be increased there and not diminished 297 and seek the peace of the city whither i have caused you to be carried away captives and pray unto the lord for it for in the peace thereof shall ye have peace 298 for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel let not your prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed 299 for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sent them saith the lord 2910 for thus saith the lord that after seventy years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place 2911 for i know the thoughts that i think toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end 2912 then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you 2913 and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart 2914 and i will be found of you saith the lord and i will turn away your captivity and i will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whither i have driven you saith the lord and i will bring you again into the place whence i caused you to be carried away captive 2915 because ye have said the lord hath raised us up prophets in babylon 2916 know that thus saith the lord of the king that sitteth upon the throne of david and of all the people that dwelleth in this city and of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity 2917 thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will send upon them the sword the famine and the pestilence and will make them like vile figs that cannot be eaten they are so evil 2918 and i will persecute them with the sword with the famine and with the pestilence and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth to be a curse and an astonishment and an hissing and a reproach among all the nations whither i have driven them 2919 because they have not hearkened to my words saith the lord which i sent unto them by my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them but ye would not hear saith the lord 2920 hear ye therefore the word of the lord all ye of the captivity whom i have sent from jerusalem to babylon 2921 thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel of ahab the son of kolaiah and of zedekiah the son of maaseiah which prophesy a lie unto you in my name behold i will deliver them into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall slay them before your eyes 2922 and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of judah which are in babylon saying the lord make thee like zedekiah and like ahab whom the king of babylon roasted in the fire 2923 because they have committed villany in israel and have committed adultery with their neighbours wives and have spoken lying words in my name which i have not commanded them even i know and am a witness saith the lord 2924 thus shalt thou also speak to shemaiah the nehelamite saying 2925 thus speaketh the lord of hosts the god of israel saying because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are at jerusalem and to zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest and to all the priests saying 2926 the lord hath made thee priest in the stead of jehoiada the priest that ye should be officers in the house of the lord for every man that is mad and maketh himself a prophet that thou shouldest put him in prison and in the stocks 2927 now therefore why hast thou not reproved jeremiah of anathoth which maketh himself a prophet to you 2928 for therefore he sent unto us in babylon saying this captivity is long build ye houses and dwell in them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them 2929 and zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of jeremiah the prophet 2930 then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying 2931 send to all them of the captivity saying thus saith the lord concerning shemaiah the nehelamite because that shemaiah hath prophesied unto you and i sent him not and he caused you to trust in a lie 2932 therefore thus saith the lord behold i will punish shemaiah the nehelamite and his seed he shall not have a man to dwell among this people neither shall he behold the good that i will do for my people saith the lord because he hath taught rebellion against the lord 301 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord saying 302 thus speaketh the lord god of israel saying write thee all the words that i have spoken unto thee in a book 303 for lo the days come saith the lord that i will bring again the captivity of my people israel and judah saith the lord and i will cause them to return to the land that i gave to their fathers and they shall possess it 304 and these are the words that the lord spake concerning israel and concerning judah 305 for thus saith the lord we have heard a voice of trembling of fear and not of peace 306 ask ye now and see whether a man doth travail with child wherefore do i see every man with his hands on his loins as a woman in travail and all faces are turned into paleness 307 alas for that day is great so that none is like it it is even the time of jacobs trouble but he shall be saved out of it 308 for it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that i will break his yoke from off thy neck and will burst thy bonds and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him 309 but they shall serve the lord their god and david their king whom i will raise up unto them 3010 therefore fear thou not o my servant jacob saith the lord neither be dismayed o israel for lo i will save thee from afar and thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall return and shall be in rest and be quiet and none shall make him afraid 3011 for i am with thee saith the lord to save thee though i make a full end of all nations whither i have scattered thee yet i will not make a full end of thee but i will correct thee in measure and will not leave thee altogether unpunished 3012 for thus saith the lord thy bruise is incurable and thy wound is grievous 3013 there is none to plead thy cause that thou mayest be bound up thou hast no healing medicines 3014 all thy lovers have forgotten thee they seek thee not for i have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy with the chastisement of a cruel one for the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sins were increased 3015 why criest thou for thine affliction thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity because thy sins were increased i have done these things unto thee 3016 therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured and all thine adversaries every one of them shall go into captivity and they that spoil thee shall be a spoil and all that prey upon thee will i give for a prey 3017 for i will restore health unto thee and i will heal thee of thy wounds saith the lord because they called thee an outcast saying this is zion whom no man seeketh after 3018 thus saith the lord behold i will bring again the captivity of jacobs tents and have mercy on his dwellingplaces and the city shall be builded upon her own heap and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof 3019 and out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry and i will multiply them and they shall not be few i will also glorify them and they shall not be small 3020 their children also shall be as aforetime and their congregation shall be established before me and i will punish all that oppress them 3021 and their nobles shall be of themselves and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them and i will cause him to draw near and he shall approach unto me for who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me saith the lord 3022 and ye shall be my people and i will be your god 3023 behold the whirlwind of the lord goeth forth with fury a continuing whirlwind it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked 3024 the fierce anger of the lord shall not return until he hath done it and until he have performed the intents of his heart in the latter days ye shall consider it 311 at the same time saith the lord will i be the god of all the families of israel and they shall be my people 312 thus saith the lord the people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness even israel when i went to cause him to rest 313 the lord hath appeared of old unto me saying yea i have loved thee with an everlasting love therefore with lovingkindness have i drawn thee 314 again i will build thee and thou shalt be built o virgin of israel thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry 315 thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of samaria the planters shall plant and shall eat them as common things 316 for there shall be a day that the watchmen upon the mount ephraim shall cry arise ye and let us go up to zion unto the lord our god 317 for thus saith the lord sing with gladness for jacob and shout among the chief of the nations publish ye praise ye and say o lord save thy people the remnant of israel 318 behold i will bring them from the north country and gather them from the coasts of the earth and with them the blind and the lame the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together a great company shall return thither 319 they shall come with weeping and with supplications will i lead them i will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way wherein they shall not stumble for i am a father to israel and ephraim is my firstborn 3110 hear the word of the lord o ye nations and declare it in the isles afar off and say he that scattered israel will gather him and keep him as a shepherd doth his flock 3111 for the lord hath redeemed jacob and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he 3112 therefore they shall come and sing in the height of zion and shall flow together to the goodness of the lord for wheat and for wine and for oil and for the young of the flock and of the herd and their soul shall be as a watered garden and they shall not sorrow any more at all 3113 then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance both young men and old together for i will turn their mourning into joy and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow 3114 and i will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness saith the lord 3115 thus saith the lord a voice was heard in ramah lamentation and bitter weeping rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children because they were not 3116 thus saith the lord refrain thy voice from weeping and thine eyes from tears for thy work shall be rewarded saith the lord and they shall come again from the land of the enemy 3117 and there is hope in thine end saith the lord that thy children shall come again to their own border 3118 i have surely heard ephraim bemoaning himself thus thou hast chastised me and i was chastised as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke turn thou me and i shall be turned for thou art the lord my god 3119 surely after that i was turned i repented and after that i was instructed i smote upon my thigh i was ashamed yea even confounded because i did bear the reproach of my youth 3120 is ephraim my dear son is he a pleasant child for since i spake against him i do earnestly remember him still therefore my bowels are troubled for him i will surely have mercy upon him saith the lord 3121 set thee up waymarks make thee high heaps set thine heart toward the highway even the way which thou wentest turn again o virgin of israel turn again to these thy cities 3122 how long wilt thou go about o thou backsliding daughter for the lord hath created a new thing in the earth a woman shall compass a man 3123 thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as yet they shall use this speech in the land of judah and in the cities thereof when i shall bring again their captivity the lord bless thee o habitation of justice and mountain of holiness 3124 and there shall dwell in judah itself and in all the cities thereof together husbandmen and they that go forth with flocks 3125 for i have satiated the weary soul and i have replenished every sorrowful soul 3126 upon this i awaked and beheld and my sleep was sweet unto me 3127 behold the days come saith the lord that i will sow the house of israel and the house of judah with the seed of man and with the seed of beast 3128 and it shall come to pass that like as i have watched over them to pluck up and to break down and to throw down and to destroy and to afflict so will i watch over them to build and to plant saith the lord 3129 in those days they shall say no more the fathers have eaten a sour grape and the childrens teeth are set on edge 3130 but every one shall die for his own iniquity every man that eateth the sour grape his teeth shall be set on edge 3131 behold the days come saith the lord that i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah 3132 not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day that i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt which my covenant they brake although i was an husband unto them saith the lord 3133 but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god and they shall be my people 3134 and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the lord for i will forgive their iniquity and i will remember their sin no more 3135 thus saith the lord which giveth the sun for a light by day and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar the lord of hosts is his name 3136 if those ordinances depart from before me saith the lord then the seed of israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever 3137 thus saith the lord if heaven above can be measured and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath i will also cast off all the seed of israel for all that they have done saith the lord 3138 behold the days come saith the lord that the city shall be built to the lord from the tower of hananeel unto the gate of the corner 3139 and the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill gareb and shall compass about to goath 3140 and the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes and all the fields unto the brook of kidron unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east shall be holy unto the lord it shall not be plucked up nor thrown down any more for ever 321 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah which was the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar 322 for then the king of babylons army besieged jerusalem and jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison which was in the king of judahs house 323 for zedekiah king of judah had shut him up saying wherefore dost thou prophesy and say thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall take it 324 and zedekiah king of judah shall not escape out of the hand of the chaldeans but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon and shall speak with him mouth to mouth and his eyes shall behold his eyes 325 and he shall lead zedekiah to babylon and there shall he be until i visit him saith the lord though ye fight with the chaldeans ye shall not prosper 326 and jeremiah said the word of the lord came unto me saying 327 behold hanameel the son of shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee saying buy thee my field that is in anathoth for the right of redemption is thine to buy it 328 so hanameel mine uncles son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the lord and said unto me buy my field i pray thee that is in anathoth which is in the country of benjamin for the right of inheritance is thine and the redemption is thine buy it for thyself then i knew that this was the word of the lord 329 and i bought the field of hanameel my uncles son that was in anathoth and weighed him the money even seventeen shekels of silver 3210 and i subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances 3211 so i took the evidence of the purchase both that which was sealed according to the law and custom and that which was open 3212 and i gave the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah the son of maaseiah in the sight of hanameel mine uncles son and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase before all the jews that sat in the court of the prison 3213 and i charged baruch before them saying 3214 thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel take these evidences this evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and this evidence which is open and put them in an earthen vessel that they may continue many days 3215 for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land 3216 now when i had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto baruch the son of neriah i prayed unto the lord saying 3217 ah lord god behold thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm and there is nothing too hard for thee 3218 thou shewest lovingkindness unto thousands and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them the great the mighty god the lord of hosts is his name 3219 great in counsel and mighty in work for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men to give every one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings 3220 which hast set signs and wonders in the land of egypt even unto this day and in israel and among other men and hast made thee a name as at this day 3221 and hast brought forth thy people israel out of the land of egypt with signs and with wonders and with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm and with great terror 3222 and hast given them this land which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey 3223 and they came in and possessed it but they obeyed not thy voice neither walked in thy law they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them 3224 behold the mounts they are come unto the city to take it and the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans that fight against it because of the sword and of the famine and of the pestilence and what thou hast spoken is come to pass and behold thou seest it 3225 and thou hast said unto me o lord god buy thee the field for money and take witnesses for the city is given into the hand of the chaldeans 3226 then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying 3227 behold i am the lord the god of all flesh is there any thing too hard for me 3228 therefore thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the chaldeans and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall take it 3229 and the chaldeans that fight against this city shall come and set fire on this city and burn it with the houses upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto baal and poured out drink offerings unto other gods to provoke me to anger 3230 for the children of israel and the children of judah have only done evil before me from their youth for the children of israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands saith the lord 3231 for this city hath been to me as a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day that i should remove it from before my face 3232 because of all the evil of the children of israel and of the children of judah which they have done to provoke me to anger they their kings their princes their priests and their prophets and the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem 3233 and they have turned unto me the back and not the face though i taught them rising up early and teaching them yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction 3234 but they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name to defile it 3235 and they built the high places of baal which are in the valley of the son of hinnom to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto molech which i commanded them not neither came it into my mind that they should do this abomination to cause judah to sin 3236 and now therefore thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning this city whereof ye say it shall be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon by the sword and by the famine and by the pestilence 3237 behold i will gather them out of all countries whither i have driven them in mine anger and in my fury and in great wrath and i will bring them again unto this place and i will cause them to dwell safely 3238 and they shall be my people and i will be their god 3239 and i will give them one heart and one way that they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their children after them 3240 and i will make an everlasting covenant with them that i will not turn away from them to do them good but i will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me 3241 yea i will rejoice over them to do them good and i will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul 3242 for thus saith the lord like as i have brought all this great evil upon this people so will i bring upon them all the good that i have promised them 3243 and fields shall be bought in this land whereof ye say it is desolate without man or beast it is given into the hand of the chaldeans 3244 men shall buy fields for money and subscribe evidences and seal them and take witnesses in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah and in the cities of the mountains and in the cities of the valley and in the cities of the south for i will cause their captivity to return saith the lord 331 moreover the word of the lord came unto jeremiah the second time while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison saying 332 thus saith the lord the maker thereof the lord that formed it to establish it the lord is his name 333 call unto me and i will answer thee and shew thee great and mighty things which thou knowest not 334 for thus saith the lord the god of israel concerning the houses of this city and concerning the houses of the kings of judah which are thrown down by the mounts and by the sword 335 they come to fight with the chaldeans but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men whom i have slain in mine anger and in my fury and for all whose wickedness i have hid my face from this city 336 behold i will bring it health and cure and i will cure them and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth 337 and i will cause the captivity of judah and the captivity of israel to return and will build them as at the first 338 and i will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they have sinned against me and i will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sinned and whereby they have transgressed against me 339 and it shall be to me a name of joy a praise and an honour before all the nations of the earth which shall hear all the good that i do unto them and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that i procure unto it 3310 thus saith the lord again there shall be heard in this place which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast even in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem that are desolate without man and without inhabitant and without beast 3311 the voice of joy and the voice of gladness the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride the voice of them that shall say praise the lord of hosts for the lord is good for his mercy endureth for ever and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the lord for i will cause to return the captivity of the land as at the first saith the lord 3312 thus saith the lord of hosts again in this place which is desolate without man and without beast and in all the cities thereof shall be an habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down 3313 in the cities of the mountains in the cities of the vale and in the cities of the south and in the land of benjamin and in the places about jerusalem and in the cities of judah shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that telleth them saith the lord 3314 behold the days come saith the lord that i will perform that good thing which i have promised unto the house of israel and to the house of judah 3315 in those days and at that time will i cause the branch of righteousness to grow up unto david and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land 3316 in those days shall judah be saved and jerusalem shall dwell safely and this is the name wherewith she shall be called the lord our righteousness 3317 for thus saith the lord david shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of israel 3318 neither shall the priests the levites want a man before me to offer burnt offerings and to kindle meat offerings and to do sacrifice continually 3319 and the word of the lord came unto jeremiah saying 3320 thus saith the lord if ye can break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night and that there should not be day and night in their season 3321 then may also my covenant be broken with david my servant that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne and with the levites the priests my ministers 3322 as the host of heaven cannot be numbered neither the sand of the sea measured so will i multiply the seed of david my servant and the levites that minister unto me 3323 moreover the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying 3324 considerest thou not what this people have spoken saying the two families which the lord hath chosen he hath even cast them off thus they have despised my people that they should be no more a nation before them 3325 thus saith the lord if my covenant be not with day and night and if i have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth 3326 then will i cast away the seed of jacob and david my servant so that i will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of abraham isaac and jacob for i will cause their captivity to return and have mercy on them 341 the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion and all the people fought against jerusalem and against all the cities thereof saying 342 thus saith the lord the god of israel go and speak to zedekiah king of judah and tell him thus saith the lord behold i will give this city into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall burn it with fire 343 and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be taken and delivered into his hand and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of babylon and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth and thou shalt go to babylon 344 yet hear the word of the lord o zedekiah king of judah thus saith the lord of thee thou shalt not die by the sword 345 but thou shalt die in peace and with the burnings of thy fathers the former kings which were before thee so shall they burn odours for thee and they will lament thee saying ah lord for i have pronounced the word saith the lord 346 then jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem 347 when the king of babylons army fought against jerusalem and against all the cities of judah that were left against lachish and against azekah for these defenced cities remained of the cities of judah 348 this is the word that came unto jeremiah from the lord after that the king zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at jerusalem to proclaim liberty unto them 349 that every man should let his manservant and every man his maidservant being an hebrew or an hebrewess go free that none should serve himself of them to wit of a jew his brother 3410 now when all the princes and all the people which had entered into the covenant heard that every one should let his manservant and every one his maidservant go free that none should serve themselves of them any more then they obeyed and let them go 3411 but afterward they turned and caused the servants and the handmaids whom they had let go free to return and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids 3412 therefore the word of the lord came to jeremiah from the lord saying 3413 thus saith the lord the god of israel i made a covenant with your fathers in the day that i brought them forth out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondmen saying 3414 at the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an hebrew which hath been sold unto thee and when he hath served thee six years thou shalt let him go free from thee but your fathers hearkened not unto me neither inclined their ear 3415 and ye were now turned and had done right in my sight in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name 3416 but ye turned and polluted my name and caused every man his servant and every man his handmaid whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure to return and brought them into subjection to be unto you for servants and for handmaids 3417 therefore thus saith the lord ye have not hearkened unto me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother and every man to his neighbour behold i proclaim a liberty for you saith the lord to the sword to the pestilence and to the famine and i will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth 3418 and i will give the men that have transgressed my covenant which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me when they cut the calf in twain and passed between the parts thereof 3419 the princes of judah and the princes of jerusalem the eunuchs and the priests and all the people of the land which passed between the parts of the calf 3420 i will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and their dead bodies shall be for meat unto the fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the earth 3421 and zedekiah king of judah and his princes will i give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of them that seek their life and into the hand of the king of babylons army which are gone up from you 3422 behold i will command saith the lord and cause them to return to this city and they shall fight against it and take it and burn it with fire and i will make the cities of judah a desolation without an inhabitant 351 the word which came unto jeremiah from the lord in the days of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying 352 go unto the house of the rechabites and speak unto them and bring them into the house of the lord into one of the chambers and give them wine to drink 353 then i took jaazaniah the son of jeremiah the son of habaziniah and his brethren and all his sons and the whole house of the rechabites 354 and i brought them into the house of the lord into the chamber of the sons of hanan the son of igdaliah a man of god which was by the chamber of the princes which was above the chamber of maaseiah the son of shallum the keeper of the door 355 and i set before the sons of the house of the rechabites pots full of wine and cups and i said unto them drink ye wine 356 but they said we will drink no wine for jonadab the son of rechab our father commanded us saying ye shall drink no wine neither ye nor your sons for ever 357 neither shall ye build house nor sow seed nor plant vineyard nor have any but all your days ye shall dwell in tents that ye may live many days in the land where ye be strangers 358 thus have we obeyed the voice of jonadab the son of rechab our father in all that he hath charged us to drink no wine all our days we our wives our sons nor our daughters 359 nor to build houses for us to dwell in neither have we vineyard nor field nor seed 3510 but we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed and done according to all that jonadab our father commanded us 3511 but it came to pass when nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came up into the land that we said come and let us go to jerusalem for fear of the army of the chaldeans and for fear of the army of the syrians so we dwell at jerusalem 3512 then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah saying 3513 thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel go and tell the men of judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words saith the lord 3514 the words of jonadab the son of rechab that he commanded his sons not to drink wine are performed for unto this day they drink none but obey their fathers commandment notwithstanding i have spoken unto you rising early and speaking but ye hearkened not unto me 3515 i have sent also unto you all my servants the prophets rising up early and sending them saying return ye now every man from his evil way and amend your doings and go not after other gods to serve them and ye shall dwell in the land which i have given to you and to your fathers but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto me 3516 because the sons of jonadab the son of rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them but this people hath not hearkened unto me 3517 therefore thus saith the lord god of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring upon judah and upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem all the evil that i have pronounced against them because i have spoken unto them but they have not heard and i have called unto them but they have not answered 3518 and jeremiah said unto the house of the rechabites thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel because ye have obeyed the commandment of jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done according unto all that he hath commanded you 3519 therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel jonadab the son of rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever 361 and it came to pass in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah that this word came unto jeremiah from the lord saying 362 take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the words that i have spoken unto thee against israel and against judah and against all the nations from the day i spake unto thee from the days of josiah even unto this day 363 it may be that the house of judah will hear all the evil which i purpose to do unto them that they may return every man from his evil way that i may forgive their iniquity and their sin 364 then jeremiah called baruch the son of neriah and baruch wrote from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the lord which he had spoken unto him upon a roll of a book 365 and jeremiah commanded baruch saying i am shut up i cannot go into the house of the lord 366 therefore go thou and read in the roll which thou hast written from my mouth the words of the lord in the ears of the people in the lords house upon the fasting day and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all judah that come out of their cities 367 it may be they will present their supplication before the lord and will return every one from his evil way for great is the anger and the fury that the lord hath pronounced against this people 368 and baruch the son of neriah did according to all that jeremiah the prophet commanded him reading in the book the words of the lord in the lords house 369 and it came to pass in the fifth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah in the ninth month that they proclaimed a fast before the lord to all the people in jerusalem and to all the people that came from the cities of judah unto jerusalem 3610 then read baruch in the book the words of jeremiah in the house of the lord in the chamber of gemariah the son of shaphan the scribe in the higher court at the entry of the new gate of the lords house in the ears of all the people 3611 when michaiah the son of gemariah the son of shaphan had heard out of the book all the words of the lord 3612 then he went down into the kings house into the scribes chamber and lo all the princes sat there even elishama the scribe and delaiah the son of shemaiah and elnathan the son of achbor and gemariah the son of shaphan and zedekiah the son of hananiah and all the princes 3613 then michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard when baruch read the book in the ears of the people 3614 therefore all the princes sent jehudi the son of nethaniah the son of shelemiah the son of cushi unto baruch saying take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people and come so baruch the son of neriah took the roll in his hand and came unto them 3615 and they said unto him sit down now and read it in our ears so baruch read it in their ears 3616 now it came to pass when they had heard all the words they were afraid both one and other and said unto baruch we will surely tell the king of all these words 3617 and they asked baruch saying tell us now how didst thou write all these words at his mouth 3618 then baruch answered them he pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth and i wrote them with ink in the book 3619 then said the princes unto baruch go hide thee thou and jeremiah and let no man know where ye be 3620 and they went in to the king into the court but they laid up the roll in the chamber of elishama the scribe and told all the words in the ears of the king 3621 so the king sent jehudi to fetch the roll and he took it out of elishama the scribes chamber and jehudi read it in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king 3622 now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him 3623 and it came to pass that when jehudi had read three or four leaves he cut it with the penknife and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth 3624 yet they were not afraid nor rent their garments neither the king nor any of his servants that heard all these words 3625 nevertheless elnathan and delaiah and gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll but he would not hear them 3626 but the king commanded jerahmeel the son of hammelech and seraiah the son of azriel and shelemiah the son of abdeel to take baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet but the lord hid them 3627 then the word of the lord came to jeremiah after that the king had burned the roll and the words which baruch wrote at the mouth of jeremiah saying 3628 take thee again another roll and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll which jehoiakim the king of judah hath burned 3629 and thou shalt say to jehoiakim king of judah thus saith the lord thou hast burned this roll saying why hast thou written therein saying the king of babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast 3630 therefore thus saith the lord of jehoiakim king of judah he shall have none to sit upon the throne of david and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat and in the night to the frost 3631 and i will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity and i will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem and upon the men of judah all the evil that i have pronounced against them but they hearkened not 3632 then took jeremiah another roll and gave it to baruch the scribe the son of neriah who wrote therein from the mouth of jeremiah all the words of the book which jehoiakim king of judah had burned in the fire and there were added besides unto them many like words 371 and king zedekiah the son of josiah reigned instead of coniah the son of jehoiakim whom nebuchadrezzar king of babylon made king in the land of judah 372 but neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land did hearken unto the words of the lord which he spake by the prophet jeremiah 373 and zedekiah the king sent jehucal the son of shelemiah and zephaniah the son of maaseiah the priest to the prophet jeremiah saying pray now unto the lord our god for us 374 now jeremiah came in and went out among the people for they had not put him into prison 375 then pharaohs army was come forth out of egypt and when the chaldeans that besieged jerusalem heard tidings of them they departed from jerusalem 376 then came the word of the lord unto the prophet jeremiah saying 377 thus saith the lord the god of israel thus shall ye say to the king of judah that sent you unto me to enquire of me behold pharaohs army which is come forth to help you shall return to egypt into their own land 378 and the chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city and take it and burn it with fire 379 thus saith the lord deceive not yourselves saying the chaldeans shall surely depart from us for they shall not depart 3710 for though ye had smitten the whole army of the chaldeans that fight against you and there remained but wounded men among them yet should they rise up every man in his tent and burn this city with fire 3711 and it came to pass that when the army of the chaldeans was broken up from jerusalem for fear of pharaohs army 3712 then jeremiah went forth out of jerusalem to go into the land of benjamin to separate himself thence in the midst of the people 3713 and when he was in the gate of benjamin a captain of the ward was there whose name was irijah the son of shelemiah the son of hananiah and he took jeremiah the prophet saying thou fallest away to the chaldeans 3714 then said jeremiah it is false i fall not away to the chaldeans but he hearkened not to him so irijah took jeremiah and brought him to the princes 3715 wherefore the princes were wroth with jeremiah and smote him and put him in prison in the house of jonathan the scribe for they had made that the prison 3716 when jeremiah was entered into the dungeon and into the cabins and jeremiah had remained there many days 3717 then zedekiah the king sent and took him out and the king asked him secretly in his house and said is there any word from the lord and jeremiah said there is for said he thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of babylon 3718 moreover jeremiah said unto king zedekiah what have i offended against thee or against thy servants or against this people that ye have put me in prison 3719 where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you saying the king of babylon shall not come against you nor against this land 3720 therefore hear now i pray thee o my lord the king let my supplication i pray thee be accepted before thee that thou cause me not to return to the house of jonathan the scribe lest i die there 3721 then zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit jeremiah into the court of the prison and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers street until all the bread in the city were spent thus jeremiah remained in the court of the prison 381 then shephatiah the son of mattan and gedaliah the son of pashur and jucal the son of shelemiah and pashur the son of malchiah heard the words that jeremiah had spoken unto all the people saying 382 thus saith the lord he that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence but he that goeth forth to the chaldeans shall live for he shall have his life for a prey and shall live 383 thus saith the lord this city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of babylons army which shall take it 384 therefore the princes said unto the king we beseech thee let this man be put to death for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city and the hands of all the people in speaking such words unto them for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people but the hurt 385 then zedekiah the king said behold he is in your hand for the king is not he that can do any thing against you 386 then took they jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of malchiah the son of hammelech that was in the court of the prison and they let down jeremiah with cords and in the dungeon there was no water but mire so jeremiah sunk in the mire 387 now when ebedmelech the ethiopian one of the eunuchs which was in the kings house heard that they had put jeremiah in the dungeon the king then sitting in the gate of benjamin 388 ebedmelech went forth out of the kings house and spake to the king saying 389 my lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done to jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is for there is no more bread in the city 3810 then the king commanded ebedmelech the ethiopian saying take from hence thirty men with thee and take up jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he die 3811 so ebedmelech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags and let them down by cords into the dungeon to jeremiah 3812 and ebedmelech the ethiopian said unto jeremiah put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords and jeremiah did so 3813 so they drew up jeremiah with cords and took him up out of the dungeon and jeremiah remained in the court of the prison 3814 then zedekiah the king sent and took jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the lord and the king said unto jeremiah i will ask thee a thing hide nothing from me 3815 then jeremiah said unto zedekiah if i declare it unto thee wilt thou not surely put me to death and if i give thee counsel wilt thou not hearken unto me 3816 so zedekiah the king sware secretly unto jeremiah saying as the lord liveth that made us this soul i will not put thee to death neither will i give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life 3817 then said jeremiah unto zedekiah thus saith the lord the god of hosts the god of israel if thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of babylons princes then thy soul shall live and this city shall not be burned with fire and thou shalt live and thine house 3818 but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of babylons princes then shall this city be given into the hand of the chaldeans and they shall burn it with fire and thou shalt not escape out of their hand 3819 and zedekiah the king said unto jeremiah i am afraid of the jews that are fallen to the chaldeans lest they deliver me into their hand and they mock me 3820 but jeremiah said they shall not deliver thee obey i beseech thee the voice of the lord which i speak unto thee so it shall be well unto thee and thy soul shall live 3821 but if thou refuse to go forth this is the word that the lord hath shewed me 3822 and behold all the women that are left in the king of judahs house shall be brought forth to the king of babylons princes and those women shall say thy friends have set thee on and have prevailed against thee thy feet are sunk in the mire and they are turned away back 3823 so they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the chaldeans and thou shalt not escape out of their hand but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of babylon and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire 3824 then said zedekiah unto jeremiah let no man know of these words and thou shalt not die 3825 but if the princes hear that i have talked with thee and they come unto thee and say unto thee declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king hide it not from us and we will not put thee to death also what the king said unto thee 3826 then thou shalt say unto them i presented my supplication before the king that he would not cause me to return to jonathans house to die there 3827 then came all the princes unto jeremiah and asked him and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded so they left off speaking with him for the matter was not perceived 3828 so jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that jerusalem was taken and he was there when jerusalem was taken 391 in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month came nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and all his army against jerusalem and they besieged it 392 and in the eleventh year of zedekiah in the fourth month the ninth day of the month the city was broken up 393 and all the princes of the king of babylon came in and sat in the middle gate even nergalsharezer samgarnebo sarsechim rabsaris nergalsharezer rabmag with all the residue of the princes of the king of babylon 394 and it came to pass that when zedekiah the king of judah saw them and all the men of war then they fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the kings garden by the gate betwixt the two walls and he went out the way of the plain 395 but the chaldeans army pursued after them and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and when they had taken him they brought him up to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath where he gave judgment upon him 396 then the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah in riblah before his eyes also the king of babylon slew all the nobles of judah 397 moreover he put out zedekiahs eyes and bound him with chains to carry him to babylon 398 and the chaldeans burned the kings house and the houses of the people with fire and brake down the walls of jerusalem 399 then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city and those that fell away that fell to him with the rest of the people that remained 3910 but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people which had nothing in the land of judah and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time 3911 now nebuchadrezzar king of babylon gave charge concerning jeremiah to nebuzaradan the captain of the guard saying 3912 take him and look well to him and do him no harm but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee 3913 so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent and nebushasban rabsaris and nergalsharezer rabmag and all the king of babylons princes 3914 even they sent and took jeremiah out of the court of the prison and committed him unto gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan that he should carry him home so he dwelt among the people 3915 now the word of the lord came unto jeremiah while he was shut up in the court of the prison saying 3916 go and speak to ebedmelech the ethiopian saying thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will bring my words upon this city for evil and not for good and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee 3917 but i will deliver thee in that day saith the lord and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid 3918 for i will surely deliver thee and thou shalt not fall by the sword but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee because thou hast put thy trust in me saith the lord 401 the word that came to jeremiah from the lord after that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from ramah when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of jerusalem and judah which were carried away captive unto babylon 402 and the captain of the guard took jeremiah and said unto him the lord thy god hath pronounced this evil upon this place 403 now the lord hath brought it and done according as he hath said because ye have sinned against the lord and have not obeyed his voice therefore this thing is come upon you 404 and now behold i loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand if it seem good unto thee to come with me into babylon come and i will look well unto thee but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into babylon forbear behold all the land is before thee whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go thither go 405 now while he was not yet gone back he said go back also to gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king of babylon hath made governor over the cities of judah and dwell with him among the people or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go so the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward and let him go 406 then went jeremiah unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land 407 now when all the captains of the forces which were in the fields even they and their men heard that the king of babylon had made gedaliah the son of ahikam governor in the land and had committed unto him men and women and children and of the poor of the land of them that were not carried away captive to babylon 408 then they came to gedaliah to mizpah even ishmael the son of nethaniah and johanan and jonathan the sons of kareah and seraiah the son of tanhumeth and the sons of ephai the netophathite and jezaniah the son of a maachathite they and their men 409 and gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan sware unto them and to their men saying fear not to serve the chaldeans dwell in the land and serve the king of babylon and it shall be well with you 4010 as for me behold i will dwell at mizpah to serve the chaldeans which will come unto us but ye gather ye wine and summer fruits and oil and put them in your vessels and dwell in your cities that ye have taken 4011 likewise when all the jews that were in moab and among the ammonites and in edom and that were in all the countries heard that the king of babylon had left a remnant of judah and that he had set over them gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan 4012 even all the jews returned out of all places whither they were driven and came to the land of judah to gedaliah unto mizpah and gathered wine and summer fruits very much 4013 moreover johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were in the fields came to gedaliah to mizpah 4014 and said unto him dost thou certainly know that baalis the king of the ammonites hath sent ishmael the son of nethaniah to slay thee but gedaliah the son of ahikam believed them not 4015 then johanan the son of kareah spake to gedaliah in mizpah secretly saying let me go i pray thee and i will slay ishmael the son of nethaniah and no man shall know it wherefore should he slay thee that all the jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered and the remnant in judah perish 4016 but gedaliah the son of ahikam said unto johanan the son of kareah thou shalt not do this thing for thou speakest falsely of ishmael 411 now it came to pass in the seventh month that ishmael the son of nethaniah the son of elishama of the seed royal and the princes of the king even ten men with him came unto gedaliah the son of ahikam to mizpah and there they did eat bread together in mizpah 412 then arose ishmael the son of nethaniah and the ten men that were with him and smote gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword and slew him whom the king of babylon had made governor over the land 413 ishmael also slew all the jews that were with him even with gedaliah at mizpah and the chaldeans that were found there and the men of war 414 and it came to pass the second day after he had slain gedaliah and no man knew it 415 that there came certain from shechem from shiloh and from samaria even fourscore men having their beards shaven and their clothes rent and having cut themselves with offerings and incense in their hand to bring them to the house of the lord 416 and ishmael the son of nethaniah went forth from mizpah to meet them weeping all along as he went and it came to pass as he met them he said unto them come to gedaliah the son of ahikam 417 and it was so when they came into the midst of the city that ishmael the son of nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst of the pit he and the men that were with him 418 but ten men were found among them that said unto ishmael slay us not for we have treasures in the field of wheat and of barley and of oil and of honey so he forbare and slew them not among their brethren 419 now the pit wherein ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men whom he had slain because of gedaliah was it which asa the king had made for fear of baasha king of israel and ishmael the son of nethaniah filled it with them that were slain 4110 then ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in mizpah even the kings daughters and all the people that remained in mizpah whom nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to gedaliah the son of ahikam and ishmael the son of nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to the ammonites 4111 but when johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him heard of all the evil that ishmael the son of nethaniah had done 4112 then they took all the men and went to fight with ishmael the son of nethaniah and found him by the great waters that are in gibeon 4113 now it came to pass that when all the people which were with ishmael saw johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him then they were glad 4114 so all the people that ishmael had carried away captive from mizpah cast about and returned and went unto johanan the son of kareah 4115 but ishmael the son of nethaniah escaped from johanan with eight men and went to the ammonites 4116 then took johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces that were with him all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from ishmael the son of nethaniah from mizpah after that he had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam even mighty men of war and the women and the children and the eunuchs whom he had brought again from gibeon 4117 and they departed and dwelt in the habitation of chimham which is by bethlehem to go to enter into egypt 4118 because of the chaldeans for they were afraid of them because ishmael the son of nethaniah had slain gedaliah the son of ahikam whom the king of babylon made governor in the land 421 then all the captains of the forces and johanan the son of kareah and jezaniah the son of hoshaiah and all the people from the least even unto the greatest came near 422 and said unto jeremiah the prophet let we beseech thee our supplication be accepted before thee and pray for us unto the lord thy god even for all this remnant for we are left but a few of many as thine eyes do behold us 423 that the lord thy god may shew us the way wherein we may walk and the thing that we may do 424 then jeremiah the prophet said unto them i have heard you behold i will pray unto the lord your god according to your words and it shall come to pass that whatsoever thing the lord shall answer you i will declare it unto you i will keep nothing back from you 425 then they said to jeremiah the lord be a true and faithful witness between us if we do not even according to all things for the which the lord thy god shall send thee to us 426 whether it be good or whether it be evil we will obey the voice of the lord our god to whom we send thee that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the lord our god 427 and it came to pass after ten days that the word of the lord came unto jeremiah 428 then called he johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces which were with him and all the people from the least even to the greatest 429 and said unto them thus saith the lord the god of israel unto whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him 4210 if ye will still abide in this land then will i build you and not pull you down and i will plant you and not pluck you up for i repent me of the evil that i have done unto you 4211 be not afraid of the king of babylon of whom ye are afraid be not afraid of him saith the lord for i am with you to save you and to deliver you from his hand 4212 and i will shew mercies unto you that he may have mercy upon you and cause you to return to your own land 4213 but if ye say we will not dwell in this land neither obey the voice of the lord your god 4214 saying no but we will go into the land of egypt where we shall see no war nor hear the sound of the trumpet nor have hunger of bread and there will we dwell 4215 and now therefore hear the word of the lord ye remnant of judah thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel if ye wholly set your faces to enter into egypt and go to sojourn there 4216 then it shall come to pass that the sword which ye feared shall overtake you there in the land of egypt and the famine whereof ye were afraid shall follow close after you there in egypt and there ye shall die 4217 so shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into egypt to sojourn there they shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that i will bring upon them 4218 for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel as mine anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of jerusalem so shall my fury be poured forth upon you when ye shall enter into egypt and ye shall be an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach and ye shall see this place no more 4219 the lord hath said concerning you o ye remnant of judah go ye not into egypt know certainly that i have admonished you this day 4220 for ye dissembled in your hearts when ye sent me unto the lord your god saying pray for us unto the lord our god and according unto all that the lord our god shall say so declare unto us and we will do it 4221 and now i have this day declared it to you but ye have not obeyed the voice of the lord your god nor any thing for the which he hath sent me unto you 4222 now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn 431 and it came to pass that when jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the lord their god for which the lord their god had sent him to them even all these words 432 then spake azariah the son of hoshaiah and johanan the son of kareah and all the proud men saying unto jeremiah thou speakest falsely the lord our god hath not sent thee to say go not into egypt to sojourn there 433 but baruch the son of neriah setteth thee on against us for to deliver us into the hand of the chaldeans that they might put us to death and carry us away captives into babylon 434 so johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces and all the people obeyed not the voice of the lord to dwell in the land of judah 435 but johanan the son of kareah and all the captains of the forces took all the remnant of judah that were returned from all nations whither they had been driven to dwell in the land of judah 436 even men and women and children and the kings daughters and every person that nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with gedaliah the son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah the prophet and baruch the son of neriah 437 so they came into the land of egypt for they obeyed not the voice of the lord thus came they even to tahpanhes 438 then came the word of the lord unto jeremiah in tahpanhes saying 439 take great stones in thine hand and hide them in the clay in the brickkiln which is at the entry of pharaohs house in tahpanhes in the sight of the men of judah 4310 and say unto them thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will send and take nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon my servant and will set his throne upon these stones that i have hid and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them 4311 and when he cometh he shall smite the land of egypt and deliver such as are for death to death and such as are for captivity to captivity and such as are for the sword to the sword 4312 and i will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of egypt and he shall burn them and carry them away captives and he shall array himself with the land of egypt as a shepherd putteth on his garment and he shall go forth from thence in peace 4313 he shall break also the images of bethshemesh that is in the land of egypt and the houses of the gods of the egyptians shall he burn with fire 441 the word that came to jeremiah concerning all the jews which dwell in the land of egypt which dwell at migdol and at tahpanhes and at noph and in the country of pathros saying 442 thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel ye have seen all the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem and upon all the cities of judah and behold this day they are a desolation and no man dwelleth therein 443 because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger in that they went to burn incense and to serve other gods whom they knew not neither they ye nor your fathers 444 howbeit i sent unto you all my servants the prophets rising early and sending them saying oh do not this abominable thing that i hate 445 but they hearkened not nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness to burn no incense unto other gods 446 wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth and was kindled in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem and they are wasted and desolate as at this day 447 therefore now thus saith the lord the god of hosts the god of israel wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls to cut off from you man and woman child and suckling out of judah to leave you none to remain 448 in that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands burning incense unto other gods in the land of egypt whither ye be gone to dwell that ye might cut yourselves off and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth 449 have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers and the wickedness of the kings of judah and the wickedness of their wives and your own wickedness and the wickedness of your wives which they have committed in the land of judah and in the streets of jerusalem 4410 they are not humbled even unto this day neither have they feared nor walked in my law nor in my statutes that i set before you and before your fathers 4411 therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will set my face against you for evil and to cut off all judah 4412 and i will take the remnant of judah that have set their faces to go into the land of egypt to sojourn there and they shall all be consumed and fall in the land of egypt they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine they shall die from the least even unto the greatest by the sword and by the famine and they shall be an execration and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach 4413 for i will punish them that dwell in the land of egypt as i have punished jerusalem by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence 4414 so that none of the remnant of judah which are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall escape or remain that they should return into the land of judah to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there for none shall return but such as shall escape 4415 then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods and all the women that stood by a great multitude even all the people that dwelt in the land of egypt in pathros answered jeremiah saying 4416 as for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the lord we will not hearken unto thee 4417 but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth to burn incense unto the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her as we have done we and our fathers our kings and our princes in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem for then had we plenty of victuals and were well and saw no evil 4418 but since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her we have wanted all things and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine 4419 and when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings unto her did we make her cakes to worship her and pour out drink offerings unto her without our men 4420 then jeremiah said unto all the people to the men and to the women and to all the people which had given him that answer saying 4421 the incense that ye burned in the cities of judah and in the streets of jerusalem ye and your fathers your kings and your princes and the people of the land did not the lord remember them and came it not into his mind 4422 so that the lord could no longer bear because of the evil of your doings and because of the abominations which ye have committed therefore is your land a desolation and an astonishment and a curse without an inhabitant as at this day 4423 because ye have burned incense and because ye have sinned against the lord and have not obeyed the voice of the lord nor walked in his law nor in his statutes nor in his testimonies therefore this evil is happened unto you as at this day 4424 moreover jeremiah said unto all the people and to all the women hear the word of the lord all judah that are in the land of egypt 4425 thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel saying ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths and fulfilled with your hand saying we will surely perform our vows that we have vowed to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her ye will surely accomplish your vows and surely perform your vows 4426 therefore hear ye the word of the lord all judah that dwell in the land of egypt behold i have sworn by my great name saith the lord that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of judah in all the land of egypt saying the lord god liveth 4427 behold i will watch over them for evil and not for good and all the men of judah that are in the land of egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine until there be an end of them 4428 yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of egypt into the land of judah and all the remnant of judah that are gone into the land of egypt to sojourn there shall know whose words shall stand mine or theirs 4429 and this shall be a sign unto you saith the lord that i will punish you in this place that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil 4430 thus saith the lord behold i will give pharaohhophra king of egypt into the hand of his enemies and into the hand of them that seek his life as i gave zedekiah king of judah into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon his enemy and that sought his life 451 the word that jeremiah the prophet spake unto baruch the son of neriah when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of jeremiah in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah saying 452 thus saith the lord the god of israel unto thee o baruch 453 thou didst say woe is me now for the lord hath added grief to my sorrow i fainted in my sighing and i find no rest 454 thus shalt thou say unto him the lord saith thus behold that which i have built will i break down and that which i have planted i will pluck up even this whole land 455 and seekest thou great things for thyself seek them not for behold i will bring evil upon all flesh saith the lord but thy life will i give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest 461 the word of the lord which came to jeremiah the prophet against the gentiles 462 against egypt against the army of pharaohnecho king of egypt which was by the river euphrates in carchemish which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon smote in the fourth year of jehoiakim the son of josiah king of judah 463 order ye the buckler and shield and draw near to battle 464 harness the horses and get up ye horsemen and stand forth with your helmets furbish the spears and put on the brigandines 465 wherefore have i seen them dismayed and turned away back and their mighty ones are beaten down and are fled apace and look not back for fear was round about saith the lord 466 let not the swift flee away nor the mighty man escape they shall stumble and fall toward the north by the river euphrates 467 who is this that cometh up as a flood whose waters are moved as the rivers 468 egypt riseth up like a flood and his waters are moved like the rivers and he saith i will go up and will cover the earth i will destroy the city and the inhabitants thereof 469 come up ye horses and rage ye chariots and let the mighty men come forth the ethiopians and the libyans that handle the shield and the lydians that handle and bend the bow 4610 for this is the day of the lord god of hosts a day of vengeance that he may avenge him of his adversaries and the sword shall devour and it shall be satiate and made drunk with their blood for the lord god of hosts hath a sacrifice in the north country by the river euphrates 4611 go up into gilead and take balm o virgin the daughter of egypt in vain shalt thou use many medicines for thou shalt not be cured 4612 the nations have heard of thy shame and thy cry hath filled the land for the mighty man hath stumbled against the mighty and they are fallen both together 4613 the word that the lord spake to jeremiah the prophet how nebuchadrezzar king of babylon should come and smite the land of egypt 4614 declare ye in egypt and publish in migdol and publish in noph and in tahpanhes say ye stand fast and prepare thee for the sword shall devour round about thee 4615 why are thy valiant men swept away they stood not because the lord did drive them 4616 he made many to fall yea one fell upon another and they said arise and let us go again to our own people and to the land of our nativity from the oppressing sword 4617 they did cry there pharaoh king of egypt is but a noise he hath passed the time appointed 4618 as i live saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts surely as tabor is among the mountains and as carmel by the sea so shall he come 4619 o thou daughter dwelling in egypt furnish thyself to go into captivity for noph shall be waste and desolate without an inhabitant 4620 egypt is like a very fair heifer but destruction cometh it cometh out of the north 4621 also her hired men are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks for they also are turned back and are fled away together they did not stand because the day of their calamity was come upon them and the time of their visitation 4622 the voice thereof shall go like a serpent for they shall march with an army and come against her with axes as hewers of wood 4623 they shall cut down her forest saith the lord though it cannot be searched because they are more than the grasshoppers and are innumerable 4624 the daughter of egypt shall be confounded she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north 4625 the lord of hosts the god of israel saith behold i will punish the multitude of no and pharaoh and egypt with their gods and their kings even pharaoh and all them that trust in him 4626 and i will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their lives and into the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and into the hand of his servants and afterward it shall be inhabited as in the days of old saith the lord 4627 but fear not thou o my servant jacob and be not dismayed o israel for behold i will save thee from afar off and thy seed from the land of their captivity and jacob shall return and be in rest and at ease and none shall make him afraid 4628 fear thou not o jacob my servant saith the lord for i am with thee for i will make a full end of all the nations whither i have driven thee but i will not make a full end of thee but correct thee in measure yet will i not leave thee wholly unpunished 471 the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against the philistines before that pharaoh smote gaza 472 thus saith the lord behold waters rise up out of the north and shall be an overflowing flood and shall overflow the land and all that is therein the city and them that dwell therein then the men shall cry and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl 473 at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses at the rushing of his chariots and at the rumbling of his wheels the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands 474 because of the day that cometh to spoil all the philistines and to cut off from tyrus and zidon every helper that remaineth for the lord will spoil the philistines the remnant of the country of caphtor 475 baldness is come upon gaza ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley how long wilt thou cut thyself 476 o thou sword of the lord how long will it be ere thou be quiet put up thyself into thy scabbard rest and be still 477 how can it be quiet seeing the lord hath given it a charge against ashkelon and against the sea shore there hath he appointed it 481 against moab thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel woe unto nebo for it is spoiled kiriathaim is confounded and taken misgab is confounded and dismayed 482 there shall be no more praise of moab in heshbon they have devised evil against it come and let us cut it off from being a nation also thou shalt be cut down o madmen the sword shall pursue thee 483 a voice of crying shall be from horonaim spoiling and great destruction 484 moab is destroyed her little ones have caused a cry to be heard 485 for in the going up of luhith continual weeping shall go up for in the going down of horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction 486 flee save your lives and be like the heath in the wilderness 487 for because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures thou shalt also be taken and chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together 488 and the spoiler shall come upon every city and no city shall escape the valley also shall perish and the plain shall be destroyed as the lord hath spoken 489 give wings unto moab that it may flee and get away for the cities thereof shall be desolate without any to dwell therein 4810 cursed be he that doeth the work of the lord deceitfully and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood 4811 moab hath been at ease from his youth and he hath settled on his lees and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel neither hath he gone into captivity therefore his taste remained in him and his scent is not changed 4812 therefore behold the days come saith the lord that i will send unto him wanderers that shall cause him to wander and shall empty his vessels and break their bottles 4813 and moab shall be ashamed of chemosh as the house of israel was ashamed of bethel their confidence 4814 how say ye we are mighty and strong men for the war 4815 moab is spoiled and gone up out of her cities and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts 4816 the calamity of moab is near to come and his affliction hasteth fast 4817 all ye that are about him bemoan him and all ye that know his name say how is the strong staff broken and the beautiful rod 4818 thou daughter that dost inhabit dibon come down from thy glory and sit in thirst for the spoiler of moab shall come upon thee and he shall destroy thy strong holds 4819 o inhabitant of aroer stand by the way and espy ask him that fleeth and her that escapeth and say what is done 4820 moab is confounded for it is broken down howl and cry tell ye it in arnon that moab is spoiled 4821 and judgment is come upon the plain country upon holon and upon jahazah and upon mephaath 4822 and upon dibon and upon nebo and upon bethdiblathaim 4823 and upon kiriathaim and upon bethgamul and upon bethmeon 4824 and upon kerioth and upon bozrah and upon all the cities of the land of moab far or near 4825 the horn of moab is cut off and his arm is broken saith the lord 4826 make ye him drunken for he magnified himself against the lord moab also shall wallow in his vomit and he also shall be in derision 4827 for was not israel a derision unto thee was he found among thieves for since thou spakest of him thou skippedst for joy 4828 o ye that dwell in moab leave the cities and dwell in the rock and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the holes mouth 4829 we have heard the pride of moab he is exceeding proud his loftiness and his arrogancy and his pride and the haughtiness of his heart 4830 i know his wrath saith the lord but it shall not be so his lies shall not so effect it 4831 therefore will i howl for moab and i will cry out for all moab mine heart shall mourn for the men of kirheres 4832 o vine of sibmah i will weep for thee with the weeping of jazer thy plants are gone over the sea they reach even to the sea of jazer the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage 4833 and joy and gladness is taken from the plentiful field and from the land of moab and i have caused wine to fail from the winepresses none shall tread with shouting their shouting shall be no shouting 4834 from the cry of heshbon even unto elealeh and even unto jahaz have they uttered their voice from zoar even unto horonaim as an heifer of three years old for the waters also of nimrim shall be desolate 4835 moreover i will cause to cease in moab saith the lord him that offereth in the high places and him that burneth incense to his gods 4836 therefore mine heart shall sound for moab like pipes and mine heart shall sound like pipes for the men of kirheres because the riches that he hath gotten are perished 4837 for every head shall be bald and every beard clipped upon all the hands shall be cuttings and upon the loins sackcloth 4838 there shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of moab and in the streets thereof for i have broken moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure saith the lord 4839 they shall howl saying how is it broken down how hath moab turned the back with shame so shall moab be a derision and a dismaying to all them about him 4840 for thus saith the lord behold he shall fly as an eagle and shall spread his wings over moab 4841 kerioth is taken and the strong holds are surprised and the mighty mens hearts in moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs 4842 and moab shall be destroyed from being a people because he hath magnified himself against the lord 4843 fear and the pit and the snare shall be upon thee o inhabitant of moab saith the lord 4844 he that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare for i will bring upon it even upon moab the year of their visitation saith the lord 4845 they that fled stood under the shadow of heshbon because of the force but a fire shall come forth out of heshbon and a flame from the midst of sihon and shall devour the corner of moab and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones 4846 woe be unto thee o moab the people of chemosh perisheth for thy sons are taken captives and thy daughters captives 4847 yet will i bring again the captivity of moab in the latter days saith the lord thus far is the judgment of moab 491 concerning the ammonites thus saith the lord hath israel no sons hath he no heir why then doth their king inherit gad and his people dwell in his cities 492 therefore behold the days come saith the lord that i will cause an alarm of war to be heard in rabbah of the ammonites and it shall be a desolate heap and her daughters shall be burned with fire then shall israel be heir unto them that were his heirs saith the lord 493 howl o heshbon for ai is spoiled cry ye daughters of rabbah gird you with sackcloth lament and run to and fro by the hedges for their king shall go into captivity and his priests and his princes together 494 wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys thy flowing valley o backsliding daughter that trusted in her treasures saying who shall come unto me 495 behold i will bring a fear upon thee saith the lord god of hosts from all those that be about thee and ye shall be driven out every man right forth and none shall gather up him that wandereth 496 and afterward i will bring again the captivity of the children of ammon saith the lord 497 concerning edom thus saith the lord of hosts is wisdom no more in teman is counsel perished from the prudent is their wisdom vanished 498 flee ye turn back dwell deep o inhabitants of dedan for i will bring the calamity of esau upon him the time that i will visit him 499 if grapegatherers come to thee would they not leave some gleaning grapes if thieves by night they will destroy till they have enough 4910 but i have made esau bare i have uncovered his secret places and he shall not be able to hide himself his seed is spoiled and his brethren and his neighbours and he is not 4911 leave thy fatherless children i will preserve them alive and let thy widows trust in me 4912 for thus saith the lord behold they whose judgment was not to drink of the cup have assuredly drunken and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished thou shalt not go unpunished but thou shalt surely drink of it 4913 for i have sworn by myself saith the lord that bozrah shall become a desolation a reproach a waste and a curse and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes 4914 i have heard a rumour from the lord and an ambassador is sent unto the heathen saying gather ye together and come against her and rise up to the battle 4915 for lo i will make thee small among the heathen and despised among men 4916 thy terribleness hath deceived thee and the pride of thine heart o thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock that holdest the height of the hill though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle i will bring thee down from thence saith the lord 4917 also edom shall be a desolation every one that goeth by it shall be astonished and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof 4918 as in the overthrow of sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof saith the lord no man shall abide there neither shall a son of man dwell in it 4919 behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of jordan against the habitation of the strong but i will suddenly make him run away from her and who is a chosen man that i may appoint over her for who is like me and who will appoint me the time and who is that shepherd that will stand before me 4920 therefore hear the counsel of the lord that he hath taken against edom and his purposes that he hath purposed against the inhabitants of teman surely the least of the flock shall draw them out surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them 4921 the earth is moved at the noise of their fall at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the red sea 4922 behold he shall come up and fly as the eagle and spread his wings over bozrah and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs 4923 concerning damascus hamath is confounded and arpad for they have heard evil tidings they are fainthearted there is sorrow on the sea it cannot be quiet 4924 damascus is waxed feeble and turneth herself to flee and fear hath seized on her anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in travail 4925 how is the city of praise not left the city of my joy 4926 therefore her young men shall fall in her streets and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day saith the lord of hosts 4927 and i will kindle a fire in the wall of damascus and it shall consume the palaces of benhadad 4928 concerning kedar and concerning the kingdoms of hazor which nebuchadrezzar king of babylon shall smite thus saith the lord arise ye go up to kedar and spoil the men of the east 4929 their tents and their flocks shall they take away they shall take to themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their camels and they shall cry unto them fear is on every side 4930 flee get you far off dwell deep o ye inhabitants of hazor saith the lord for nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath taken counsel against you and hath conceived a purpose against you 4931 arise get you up unto the wealthy nation that dwelleth without care saith the lord which have neither gates nor bars which dwell alone 4932 and their camels shall be a booty and the multitude of their cattle a spoil and i will scatter into all winds them that are in the utmost corners and i will bring their calamity from all sides thereof saith the lord 4933 and hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons and a desolation for ever there shall no man abide there nor any son of man dwell in it 4934 the word of the lord that came to jeremiah the prophet against elam in the beginning of the reign of zedekiah king of judah saying 4935 thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will break the bow of elam the chief of their might 4936 and upon elam will i bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven and will scatter them toward all those winds and there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of elam shall not come 4937 for i will cause elam to be dismayed before their enemies and before them that seek their life and i will bring evil upon them even my fierce anger saith the lord and i will send the sword after them till i have consumed them 4938 and i will set my throne in elam and will destroy from thence the king and the princes saith the lord 4939 but it shall come to pass in the latter days that i will bring again the captivity of elam saith the lord 501 the word that the lord spake against babylon and against the land of the chaldeans by jeremiah the prophet 502 declare ye among the nations and publish and set up a standard publish and conceal not say babylon is taken bel is confounded merodach is broken in pieces her idols are confounded her images are broken in pieces 503 for out of the north there cometh up a nation against her which shall make her land desolate and none shall dwell therein they shall remove they shall depart both man and beast 504 in those days and in that time saith the lord the children of israel shall come they and the children of judah together going and weeping they shall go and seek the lord their god 505 they shall ask the way to zion with their faces thitherward saying come and let us join ourselves to the lord in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten 506 my people hath been lost sheep their shepherds have caused them to go astray they have turned them away on the mountains they have gone from mountain to hill they have forgotten their restingplace 507 all that found them have devoured them and their adversaries said we offend not because they have sinned against the lord the habitation of justice even the lord the hope of their fathers 508 remove out of the midst of babylon and go forth out of the land of the chaldeans and be as the he goats before the flocks 509 for lo i will raise and cause to come up against babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country and they shall set themselves in array against her from thence she shall be taken their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man none shall return in vain 5010 and chaldea shall be a spoil all that spoil her shall be satisfied saith the lord 5011 because ye were glad because ye rejoiced o ye destroyers of mine heritage because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass and bellow as bulls 5012 your mother shall be sore confounded she that bare you shall be ashamed behold the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness a dry land and a desert 5013 because of the wrath of the lord it shall not be inhabited but it shall be wholly desolate every one that goeth by babylon shall be astonished and hiss at all her plagues 5014 put yourselves in array against babylon round about all ye that bend the bow shoot at her spare no arrows for she hath sinned against the lord 5015 shout against her round about she hath given her hand her foundations are fallen her walls are thrown down for it is the vengeance of the lord take vengeance upon her as she hath done do unto her 5016 cut off the sower from babylon and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people and they shall flee every one to his own land 5017 israel is a scattered sheep the lions have driven him away first the king of assyria hath devoured him and last this nebuchadrezzar king of babylon hath broken his bones 5018 therefore thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel behold i will punish the king of babylon and his land as i have punished the king of assyria 5019 and i will bring israel again to his habitation and he shall feed on carmel and bashan and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount ephraim and gilead 5020 in those days and in that time saith the lord the iniquity of israel shall be sought for and there shall be none and the sins of judah and they shall not be found for i will pardon them whom i reserve 5021 go up against the land of merathaim even against it and against the inhabitants of pekod waste and utterly destroy after them saith the lord and do according to all that i have commanded thee 5022 a sound of battle is in the land and of great destruction 5023 how is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken how is babylon become a desolation among the nations 5024 i have laid a snare for thee and thou art also taken o babylon and thou wast not aware thou art found and also caught because thou hast striven against the lord 5025 the lord hath opened his armoury and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation for this is the work of the lord god of hosts in the land of the chaldeans 5026 come against her from the utmost border open her storehouses cast her up as heaps and destroy her utterly let nothing of her be left 5027 slay all her bullocks let them go down to the slaughter woe unto them for their day is come the time of their visitation 5028 the voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of babylon to declare in zion the vengeance of the lord our god the vengeance of his temple 5029 call together the archers against babylon all ye that bend the bow camp against it round about let none thereof escape recompense her according to her work according to all that she hath done do unto her for she hath been proud against the lord against the holy one of israel 5030 therefore shall her young men fall in the streets and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day saith the lord 5031 behold i am against thee o thou most proud saith the lord god of hosts for thy day is come the time that i will visit thee 5032 and the most proud shall stumble and fall and none shall raise him up and i will kindle a fire in his cities and it shall devour all round about him 5033 thus saith the lord of hosts the children of israel and the children of judah were oppressed together and all that took them captives held them fast they refused to let them go 5034 their redeemer is strong the lord of hosts is his name he shall throughly plead their cause that he may give rest to the land and disquiet the inhabitants of babylon 5035 a sword is upon the chaldeans saith the lord and upon the inhabitants of babylon and upon her princes and upon her wise men 5036 a sword is upon the liars and they shall dote a sword is upon her mighty men and they shall be dismayed 5037 a sword is upon their horses and upon their chariots and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her and they shall become as women a sword is upon her treasures and they shall be robbed 5038 a drought is upon her waters and they shall be dried up for it is the land of graven images and they are mad upon their idols 5039 therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there and the owls shall dwell therein and it shall be no more inhabited for ever neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation 5040 as god overthrew sodom and gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof saith the lord so shall no man abide there neither shall any son of man dwell therein 5041 behold a people shall come from the north and a great nation and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth 5042 they shall hold the bow and the lance they are cruel and will not shew mercy their voice shall roar like the sea and they shall ride upon horses every one put in array like a man to the battle against thee o daughter of babylon 5043 the king of babylon hath heard the report of them and his hands waxed feeble anguish took hold of him and pangs as of a woman in travail 5044 behold he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of jordan unto the habitation of the strong but i will make them suddenly run away from her and who is a chosen man that i may appoint over her for who is like me and who will appoint me the time and who is that shepherd that will stand before me 5045 therefore hear ye the counsel of the lord that he hath taken against babylon and his purposes that he hath purposed against the land of the chaldeans surely the least of the flock shall draw them out surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them 5046 at the noise of the taking of babylon the earth is moved and the cry is heard among the nations 511 thus saith the lord behold i will raise up against babylon and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me a destroying wind 512 and will send unto babylon fanners that shall fan her and shall empty her land for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about 513 against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine and spare ye not her young men destroy ye utterly all her host 514 thus the slain shall fall in the land of the chaldeans and they that are thrust through in her streets 515 for israel hath not been forsaken nor judah of his god of the lord of hosts though their land was filled with sin against the holy one of israel 516 flee out of the midst of babylon and deliver every man his soul be not cut off in her iniquity for this is the time of the lords vengeance he will render unto her a recompence 517 babylon hath been a golden cup in the lords hand that made all the earth drunken the nations have drunken of her wine therefore the nations are mad 518 babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed howl for her take balm for her pain if so be she may be healed 519 we would have healed babylon but she is not healed forsake her and let us go every one into his own country for her judgment reacheth unto heaven and is lifted up even to the skies 5110 the lord hath brought forth our righteousness come and let us declare in zion the work of the lord our god 5111 make bright the arrows gather the shields the lord hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the medes for his device is against babylon to destroy it because it is the vengeance of the lord the vengeance of his temple 5112 set up the standard upon the walls of babylon make the watch strong set up the watchmen prepare the ambushes for the lord hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of babylon 5113 o thou that dwellest upon many waters abundant in treasures thine end is come and the measure of thy covetousness 5114 the lord of hosts hath sworn by himself saying surely i will fill thee with men as with caterpillers and they shall lift up a shout against thee 5115 he hath made the earth by his power he hath established the world by his wisdom and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding 5116 when he uttereth his voice there is a multitude of waters in the heavens and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth he maketh lightnings with rain and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures 5117 every man is brutish by his knowledge every founder is confounded by the graven image for his molten image is falsehood and there is no breath in them 5118 they are vanity the work of errors in the time of their visitation they shall perish 5119 the portion of jacob is not like them for he is the former of all things and israel is the rod of his inheritance the lord of hosts is his name 5120 thou art my battle axe and weapons of war for with thee will i break in pieces the nations and with thee will i destroy kingdoms 5121 and with thee will i break in pieces the horse and his rider and with thee will i break in pieces the chariot and his rider 5122 with thee also will i break in pieces man and woman and with thee will i break in pieces old and young and with thee will i break in pieces the young man and the maid 5123 i will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock and with thee will i break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen and with thee will i break in pieces captains and rulers 5124 and i will render unto babylon and to all the inhabitants of chaldea all their evil that they have done in zion in your sight saith the lord 5125 behold i am against thee o destroying mountain saith the lord which destroyest all the earth and i will stretch out mine hand upon thee and roll thee down from the rocks and will make thee a burnt mountain 5126 and they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner nor a stone for foundations but thou shalt be desolate for ever saith the lord 5127 set ye up a standard in the land blow the trumpet among the nations prepare the nations against her call together against her the kingdoms of ararat minni and ashchenaz appoint a captain against her cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers 5128 prepare against her the nations with the kings of the medes the captains thereof and all the rulers thereof and all the land of his dominion 5129 and the land shall tremble and sorrow for every purpose of the lord shall be performed against babylon to make the land of babylon a desolation without an inhabitant 5130 the mighty men of babylon have forborn to fight they have remained in their holds their might hath failed they became as women they have burned her dwellingplaces her bars are broken 5131 one post shall run to meet another and one messenger to meet another to shew the king of babylon that his city is taken at one end 5132 and that the passages are stopped and the reeds they have burned with fire and the men of war are affrighted 5133 for thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel the daughter of babylon is like a threshingfloor it is time to thresh her yet a little while and the time of her harvest shall come 5134 nebuchadrezzar the king of babylon hath devoured me he hath crushed me he hath made me an empty vessel he hath swallowed me up like a dragon he hath filled his belly with my delicates he hath cast me out 5135 the violence done to me and to my flesh be upon babylon shall the inhabitant of zion say and my blood upon the inhabitants of chaldea shall jerusalem say 5136 therefore thus saith the lord behold i will plead thy cause and take vengeance for thee and i will dry up her sea and make her springs dry 5137 and babylon shall become heaps a dwellingplace for dragons an astonishment and an hissing without an inhabitant 5138 they shall roar together like lions they shall yell as lions whelps 5139 in their heat i will make their feasts and i will make them drunken that they may rejoice and sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake saith the lord 5140 i will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter like rams with he goats 5141 how is sheshach taken and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised how is babylon become an astonishment among the nations 5142 the sea is come up upon babylon she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof 5143 her cities are a desolation a dry land and a wilderness a land wherein no man dwelleth neither doth any son of man pass thereby 5144 and i will punish bel in babylon and i will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him yea the wall of babylon shall fall 5145 my people go ye out of the midst of her and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the lord 5146 and lest your heart faint and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land a rumour shall both come one year and after that in another year shall come a rumour and violence in the land ruler against ruler 5147 therefore behold the days come that i will do judgment upon the graven images of babylon and her whole land shall be confounded and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her 5148 then the heaven and the earth and all that is therein shall sing for babylon for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north saith the lord 5149 as babylon hath caused the slain of israel to fall so at babylon shall fall the slain of all the earth 5150 ye that have escaped the sword go away stand not still remember the lord afar off and let jerusalem come into your mind 5151 we are confounded because we have heard reproach shame hath covered our faces for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the lords house 5152 wherefore behold the days come saith the lord that i will do judgment upon her graven images and through all her land the wounded shall groan 5153 though babylon should mount up to heaven and though she should fortify the height of her strength yet from me shall spoilers come unto her saith the lord 5154 a sound of a cry cometh from babylon and great destruction from the land of the chaldeans 5155 because the lord hath spoiled babylon and destroyed out of her the great voice when her waves do roar like great waters a noise of their voice is uttered 5156 because the spoiler is come upon her even upon babylon and her mighty men are taken every one of their bows is broken for the lord god of recompences shall surely requite 5157 and i will make drunk her princes and her wise men her captains and her rulers and her mighty men and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep and not wake saith the king whose name is the lord of hosts 5158 thus saith the lord of hosts the broad walls of babylon shall be utterly broken and her high gates shall be burned with fire and the people shall labour in vain and the folk in the fire and they shall be weary 5159 the word which jeremiah the prophet commanded seraiah the son of neriah the son of maaseiah when he went with zedekiah the king of judah into babylon in the fourth year of his reign and this seraiah was a quiet prince 5160 so jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon babylon even all these words that are written against babylon 5161 and jeremiah said to seraiah when thou comest to babylon and shalt see and shalt read all these words 5162 then shalt thou say o lord thou hast spoken against this place to cut it off that none shall remain in it neither man nor beast but that it shall be desolate for ever 5163 and it shall be when thou hast made an end of reading this book that thou shalt bind a stone to it and cast it into the midst of euphrates 5164 and thou shalt say thus shall babylon sink and shall not rise from the evil that i will bring upon her and they shall be weary thus far are the words of jeremiah 521 zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign and he reigned eleven years in jerusalem and his mothers name was hamutal the daughter of jeremiah of libnah 522 and he did that which was evil in the eyes of the lord according to all that jehoiakim had done 523 for through the anger of the lord it came to pass in jerusalem and judah till he had cast them out from his presence that zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon 524 and it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month that nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came he and all his army against jerusalem and pitched against it and built forts against it round about 525 so the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king zedekiah 526 and in the fourth month in the ninth day of the month the famine was sore in the city so that there was no bread for the people of the land 527 then the city was broken up and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls which was by the kings garden now the chaldeans were by the city round about and they went by the way of the plain 528 but the army of the chaldeans pursued after the king and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho and all his army was scattered from him 529 then they took the king and carried him up unto the king of babylon to riblah in the land of hamath where he gave judgment upon him 5210 and the king of babylon slew the sons of zedekiah before his eyes he slew also all the princes of judah in riblah 5211 then he put out the eyes of zedekiah and the king of babylon bound him in chains and carried him to babylon and put him in prison till the day of his death 5212 now in the fifth month in the tenth day of the month which was the nineteenth year of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon came nebuzaradan captain of the guard which served the king of babylon into jerusalem 5213 and burned the house of the lord and the kings house and all the houses of jerusalem and all the houses of the great men burned he with fire 5214 and all the army of the chaldeans that were with the captain of the guard brake down all the walls of jerusalem round about 5215 then nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people and the residue of the people that remained in the city and those that fell away that fell to the king of babylon and the rest of the multitude 5216 but nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen 5217 also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the lord and the bases and the brasen sea that was in the house of the lord the chaldeans brake and carried all the brass of them to babylon 5218 the caldrons also and the shovels and the snuffers and the bowls and the spoons and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered took they away 5219 and the basons and the firepans and the bowls and the caldrons and the candlesticks and the spoons and the cups that which was of gold in gold and that which was of silver in silver took the captain of the guard away 5220 the two pillars one sea and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases which king solomon had made in the house of the lord the brass of all these vessels was without weight 5221 and concerning the pillars the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it and the thickness thereof was four fingers it was hollow 5222 and a chapiter of brass was upon it and the height of one chapiter was five cubits with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about all of brass the second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these 5223 and there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about 5224 and the captain of the guard took seraiah the chief priest and zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the door 5225 he took also out of the city an eunuch which had the charge of the men of war and seven men of them that were near the kings person which were found in the city and the principal scribe of the host who mustered the people of the land and threescore men of the people of the land that were found in the midst of the city 5226 so nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of babylon to riblah 5227 and the king of babylon smote them and put them to death in riblah in the land of hamath thus judah was carried away captive out of his own land 5228 this is the people whom nebuchadrezzar carried away captive in the seventh year three thousand jews and three and twenty 5229 in the eighteenth year of nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons 5230 in the three and twentieth year of nebuchadrezzar nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the jews seven hundred forty and five persons all the persons were four thousand and six hundred 5231 and it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of jehoiachin king of judah in the twelfth month in the five and twentieth day of the month that evilmerodach king of babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of jehoiachin king of judah and brought him forth out of prison 5232 and spake kindly unto him and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in babylon 5233 and changed his prison garments and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life 5234 and for his diet there was a continual diet given him of the king of babylon every day a portion until the day of his death all the days of his life the lamentations of jeremiah 11 how doth the city sit solitary that was full of people how is she become as a widow she that was great among the nations and princess among the provinces how is she become tributary 12 she weepeth sore in the night and her tears are on her cheeks among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her all her friends have dealt treacherously with her they are become her enemies 13 judah is gone into captivity because of affliction and because of great servitude she dwelleth among the heathen she findeth no rest all her persecutors overtook her between the straits 14 the ways of zion do mourn because none come to the solemn feasts all her gates are desolate her priests sigh her virgins are afflicted and she is in bitterness 15 her adversaries are the chief her enemies prosper for the lord hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions her children are gone into captivity before the enemy 16 and from the daughter of zion all her beauty is departed her princes are become like harts that find no pasture and they are gone without strength before the pursuer 17 jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old when her people fell into the hand of the enemy and none did help her the adversaries saw her and did mock at her sabbaths 18 jerusalem hath grievously sinned therefore she is removed all that honoured her despise her because they have seen her nakedness yea she sigheth and turneth backward 19 her filthiness is in her skirts she remembereth not her last end therefore she came down wonderfully she had no comforter o lord behold my affliction for the enemy hath magnified himself 110 the adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation 111 all her people sigh they seek bread they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul see o lord and consider for i am become vile 112 is it nothing to you all ye that pass by behold and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow which is done unto me wherewith the lord hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger 113 from above hath he sent fire into my bones and it prevaileth against them he hath spread a net for my feet he hath turned me back he hath made me desolate and faint all the day 114 the yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand they are wreathed and come up upon my neck he hath made my strength to fall the lord hath delivered me into their hands from whom i am not able to rise up 115 the lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men the lord hath trodden the virgin the daughter of judah as in a winepress 116 for these things i weep mine eye mine eye runneth down with water because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me my children are desolate because the enemy prevailed 117 zion spreadeth forth her hands and there is none to comfort her the lord hath commanded concerning jacob that his adversaries should be round about him jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them 118 the lord is righteous for i have rebelled against his commandment hear i pray you all people and behold my sorrow my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity 119 i called for my lovers but they deceived me my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city while they sought their meat to relieve their souls 120 behold o lord for i am in distress my bowels are troubled mine heart is turned within me for i have grievously rebelled abroad the sword bereaveth at home there is as death 121 they have heard that i sigh there is none to comfort me all mine enemies have heard of my trouble they are glad that thou hast done it thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called and they shall be like unto me 122 let all their wickedness come before thee and do unto them as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions for my sighs are many and my heart is faint 21 how hath the lord covered the daughter of zion with a cloud in his anger and cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of israel and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger 22 the lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of jacob and hath not pitied he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of judah he hath brought them down to the ground he hath polluted the kingdom and the princes thereof 23 he hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of israel he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy and he burned against jacob like a flaming fire which devoureth round about 24 he hath bent his bow like an enemy he stood with his right hand as an adversary and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of zion he poured out his fury like fire 25 the lord was as an enemy he hath swallowed up israel he hath swallowed up all her palaces he hath destroyed his strong holds and hath increased in the daughter of judah mourning and lamentation 26 and he hath violently taken away his tabernacle as if it were of a garden he hath destroyed his places of the assembly the lord hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in zion and hath despised in the indignation of his anger the king and the priest 27 the lord hath cast off his altar he hath abhorred his sanctuary he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces they have made a noise in the house of the lord as in the day of a solemn feast 28 the lord hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of zion he hath stretched out a line he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament they languished together 29 her gates are sunk into the ground he hath destroyed and broken her bars her king and her princes are among the gentiles the law is no more her prophets also find no vision from the lord 210 the elders of the daughter of zion sit upon the ground and keep silence they have cast up dust upon their heads they have girded themselves with sackcloth the virgins of jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground 211 mine eyes do fail with tears my bowels are troubled my liver is poured upon the earth for the destruction of the daughter of my people because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city 212 they say to their mothers where is corn and wine when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city when their soul was poured out into their mothers bosom 213 what thing shall i take to witness for thee what thing shall i liken to thee o daughter of jerusalem what shall i equal to thee that i may comfort thee o virgin daughter of zion for thy breach is great like the sea who can heal thee 214 thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee and they have not discovered thine iniquity to turn away thy captivity but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment 215 all that pass by clap their hands at thee they hiss and wag their head at the daughter of jerusalem saying is this the city that men call the perfection of beauty the joy of the whole earth 216 all thine enemies have opened their mouth against thee they hiss and gnash the teeth they say we have swallowed her up certainly this is the day that we looked for we have found we have seen it 217 the lord hath done that which he had devised he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old he hath thrown down and hath not pitied and he hath caused thine enemy to rejoice over thee he hath set up the horn of thine adversaries 218 their heart cried unto the lord o wall of the daughter of zion let tears run down like a river day and night give thyself no rest let not the apple of thine eye cease 219 arise cry out in the night in the beginning of the watches pour out thine heart like water before the face of the lord lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children that faint for hunger in the top of every street 220 behold o lord and consider to whom thou hast done this shall the women eat their fruit and children of a span long shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the lord 221 the young and the old lie on the ground in the streets my virgins and my young men are fallen by the sword thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger thou hast killed and not pitied 222 thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors round about so that in the day of the lords anger none escaped nor remained those that i have swaddled and brought up hath mine enemy consumed 31 i am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath 32 he hath led me and brought me into darkness but not into light 33 surely against me is he turned he turneth his hand against me all the day 34 my flesh and my skin hath he made old he hath broken my bones 35 he hath builded against me and compassed me with gall and travail 36 he hath set me in dark places as they that be dead of old 37 he hath hedged me about that i cannot get out he hath made my chain heavy 38 also when i cry and shout he shutteth out my prayer 39 he hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone he hath made my paths crooked 310 he was unto me as a bear lying in wait and as a lion in secret places 311 he hath turned aside my ways and pulled me in pieces he hath made me desolate 312 he hath bent his bow and set me as a mark for the arrow 313 he hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins 314 i was a derision to all my people and their song all the day 315 he hath filled me with bitterness he hath made me drunken with wormwood 316 he hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones he hath covered me with ashes 317 and thou hast removed my soul far off from peace i forgat prosperity 318 and i said my strength and my hope is perished from the lord 319 remembering mine affliction and my misery the wormwood and the gall 320 my soul hath them still in remembrance and is humbled in me 321 this i recall to my mind therefore have i hope 322 it is of the lords mercies that we are not consumed because his compassions fail not 323 they are new every morning great is thy faithfulness 324 the lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will i hope in him 325 the lord is good unto them that wait for him to the soul that seeketh him 326 it is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the lord 327 it is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth 328 he sitteth alone and keepeth silence because he hath borne it upon him 329 he putteth his mouth in the dust if so be there may be hope 330 he giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him he is filled full with reproach 331 for the lord will not cast off for ever 332 but though he cause grief yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies 333 for he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men 334 to crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth 335 to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most high 336 to subvert a man in his cause the lord approveth not 337 who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the lord commandeth it not 338 out of the mouth of the most high proceedeth not evil and good 339 wherefore doth a living man complain a man for the punishment of his sins 340 let us search and try our ways and turn again to the lord 341 let us lift up our heart with our hands unto god in the heavens 342 we have transgressed and have rebelled thou hast not pardoned 343 thou hast covered with anger and persecuted us thou hast slain thou hast not pitied 344 thou hast covered thyself with a cloud that our prayer should not pass through 345 thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people 346 all our enemies have opened their mouths against us 347 fear and a snare is come upon us desolation and destruction 348 mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people 349 mine eye trickleth down and ceaseth not without any intermission 350 till the lord look down and behold from heaven 351 mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city 352 mine enemies chased me sore like a bird without cause 353 they have cut off my life in the dungeon and cast a stone upon me 354 waters flowed over mine head then i said i am cut off 355 i called upon thy name o lord out of the low dungeon 356 thou hast heard my voice hide not thine ear at my breathing at my cry 357 thou drewest near in the day that i called upon thee thou saidst fear not 358 o lord thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul thou hast redeemed my life 359 o lord thou hast seen my wrong judge thou my cause 360 thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me 361 thou hast heard their reproach o lord and all their imaginations against me 362 the lips of those that rose up against me and their device against me all the day 363 behold their sitting down and their rising up i am their musick 364 render unto them a recompence o lord according to the work of their hands 365 give them sorrow of heart thy curse unto them 366 persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the lord 41 how is the gold become dim how is the most fine gold changed the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street 42 the precious sons of zion comparable to fine gold how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers the work of the hands of the potter 43 even the sea monsters draw out the breast they give suck to their young ones the daughter of my people is become cruel like the ostriches in the wilderness 44 the tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst the young children ask bread and no man breaketh it unto them 45 they that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills 46 for the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of sodom that was overthrown as in a moment and no hands stayed on her 47 her nazarites were purer than snow they were whiter than milk they were more ruddy in body than rubies their polishing was of sapphire 48 their visage is blacker than a coal they are not known in the streets their skin cleaveth to their bones it is withered it is become like a stick 49 they that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger for these pine away stricken through for want of the fruits of the field 410 the hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people 411 the lord hath accomplished his fury he hath poured out his fierce anger and hath kindled a fire in zion and it hath devoured the foundations thereof 412 the kings of the earth and all the inhabitants of the world would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of jerusalem 413 for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her 414 they have wandered as blind men in the streets they have polluted themselves with blood so that men could not touch their garments 415 they cried unto them depart ye it is unclean depart depart touch not when they fled away and wandered they said among the heathen they shall no more sojourn there 416 the anger of the lord hath divided them he will no more regard them they respected not the persons of the priests they favoured not the elders 417 as for us our eyes as yet failed for our vain help in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us 418 they hunt our steps that we cannot go in our streets our end is near our days are fulfilled for our end is come 419 our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven they pursued us upon the mountains they laid wait for us in the wilderness 420 the breath of our nostrils the anointed of the lord was taken in their pits of whom we said under his shadow we shall live among the heathen 421 rejoice and be glad o daughter of edom that dwellest in the land of uz the cup also shall pass through unto thee thou shalt be drunken and shalt make thyself naked 422 the punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished o daughter of zion he will no more carry thee away into captivity he will visit thine iniquity o daughter of edom he will discover thy sins 51 remember o lord what is come upon us consider and behold our reproach 52 our inheritance is turned to strangers our houses to aliens 53 we are orphans and fatherless our mothers are as widows 54 we have drunken our water for money our wood is sold unto us 55 our necks are under persecution we labour and have no rest 56 we have given the hand to the egyptians and to the assyrians to be satisfied with bread 57 our fathers have sinned and are not and we have borne their iniquities 58 servants have ruled over us there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand 59 we gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness 510 our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine 511 they ravished the women in zion and the maids in the cities of judah 512 princes are hanged up by their hand the faces of elders were not honoured 513 they took the young men to grind and the children fell under the wood 514 the elders have ceased from the gate the young men from their musick 515 the joy of our heart is ceased our dance is turned into mourning 516 the crown is fallen from our head woe unto us that we have sinned 517 for this our heart is faint for these things our eyes are dim 518 because of the mountain of zion which is desolate the foxes walk upon it 519 thou o lord remainest for ever thy throne from generation to generation 520 wherefore dost thou forget us for ever and forsake us so long time 521 turn thou us unto thee o lord and we shall be turned renew our days as of old 522 but thou hast utterly rejected us thou art very wroth against us the book of the prophet ezekiel 11 now it came to pass in the thirtieth year in the fourth month in the fifth day of the month as i was among the captives by the river of chebar that the heavens were opened and i saw visions of god 12 in the fifth day of the month which was the fifth year of king jehoiachins captivity 13 the word of the lord came expressly unto ezekiel the priest the son of buzi in the land of the chaldeans by the river chebar and the hand of the lord was there upon him 14 and i looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the north a great cloud and a fire infolding itself and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber out of the midst of the fire 15 also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man 16 and every one had four faces and every one had four wings 17 and their feet were straight feet and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calfs foot and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass 18 and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides and they four had their faces and their wings 19 their wings were joined one to another they turned not when they went they went every one straight forward 110 as for the likeness of their faces they four had the face of a man and the face of a lion on the right side and they four had the face of an ox on the left side they four also had the face of an eagle 111 thus were their faces and their wings were stretched upward two wings of every one were joined one to another and two covered their bodies 112 and they went every one straight forward whither the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went 113 as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps it went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning 114 and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning 115 now as i beheld the living creatures behold one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures with his four faces 116 the appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl and they four had one likeness and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel 117 when they went they went upon their four sides and they turned not when they went 118 as for their rings they were so high that they were dreadful and their rings were full of eyes round about them four 119 and when the living creatures went the wheels went by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up 120 whithersoever the spirit was to go they went thither was their spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels 121 when those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels 122 and the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living creature was as the colour of the terrible crystal stretched forth over their heads above 123 and under the firmament were their wings straight the one toward the other every one had two which covered on this side and every one had two which covered on that side their bodies 124 and when they went i heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters as the voice of the almighty the voice of speech as the noise of an host when they stood they let down their wings 125 and there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads when they stood and had let down their wings 126 and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it 127 and i saw as the colour of amber as the appearance of fire round about within it from the appearance of his loins even upward and from the appearance of his loins even downward i saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness round about 128 as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the lord and when i saw it i fell upon my face and i heard a voice of one that spake 21 and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and i will speak unto thee 22 and the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me and set me upon my feet that i heard him that spake unto me 23 and he said unto me son of man i send thee to the children of israel to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day 24 for they are impudent children and stiffhearted i do send thee unto them and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god 25 and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are a rebellious house yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them 26 and thou son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words though briers and thorns be with thee and thou dost dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house 27 and thou shalt speak my words unto them whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious 28 but thou son of man hear what i say unto thee be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house open thy mouth and eat that i give thee 29 and when i looked behold an hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a book was therein 210 and he spread it before me and it was written within and without and there was written therein lamentations and mourning and woe 31 moreover he said unto me son of man eat that thou findest eat this roll and go speak unto the house of israel 32 so i opened my mouth and he caused me to eat that roll 33 and he said unto me son of man cause thy belly to eat and fill thy bowels with this roll that i give thee then did i eat it and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness 34 and he said unto me son of man go get thee unto the house of israel and speak with my words unto them 35 for thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language but to the house of israel 36 not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language whose words thou canst not understand surely had i sent thee to them they would have hearkened unto thee 37 but the house of israel will not hearken unto thee for they will not hearken unto me for all the house of israel are impudent and hardhearted 38 behold i have made thy face strong against their faces and thy forehead strong against their foreheads 39 as an adamant harder than flint have i made thy forehead fear them not neither be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house 310 moreover he said unto me son of man all my words that i shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart and hear with thine ears 311 and go get thee to them of the captivity unto the children of thy people and speak unto them and tell them thus saith the lord god whether they will hear or whether they will forbear 312 then the spirit took me up and i heard behind me a voice of a great rushing saying blessed be the glory of the lord from his place 313 i heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another and the noise of the wheels over against them and a noise of a great rushing 314 so the spirit lifted me up and took me away and i went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit but the hand of the lord was strong upon me 315 then i came to them of the captivity at telabib that dwelt by the river of chebar and i sat where they sat and remained there astonished among them seven days 316 and it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the lord came unto me saying 317 son of man i have made thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me 318 when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die and thou givest him not warning nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way to save his life the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thine hand 319 yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul 320 again when a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity and i lay a stumblingblock before him he shall die because thou hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered but his blood will i require at thine hand 321 nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous sin not and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he is warned also thou hast delivered thy soul 322 and the hand of the lord was there upon me and he said unto me arise go forth into the plain and i will there talk with thee 323 then i arose and went forth into the plain and behold the glory of the lord stood there as the glory which i saw by the river of chebar and i fell on my face 324 then the spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet and spake with me and said unto me go shut thyself within thine house 325 but thou o son of man behold they shall put bands upon thee and shall bind thee with them and thou shalt not go out among them 326 and i will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth that thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover for they are a rebellious house 327 but when i speak with thee i will open thy mouth and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the lord god he that heareth let him hear and he that forbeareth let him forbear for they are a rebellious house 41 thou also son of man take thee a tile and lay it before thee and pourtray upon it the city even jerusalem 42 and lay siege against it and build a fort against it and cast a mount against it set the camp also against it and set battering rams against it round about 43 moreover take thou unto thee an iron pan and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city and set thy face against it and it shall be besieged and thou shalt lay siege against it this shall be a sign to the house of israel 44 lie thou also upon thy left side and lay the iniquity of the house of israel upon it according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity 45 for i have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity according to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of israel 46 and when thou hast accomplished them lie again on thy right side and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of judah forty days i have appointed thee each day for a year 47 therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of jerusalem and thine arm shall be uncovered and thou shalt prophesy against it 48 and behold i will lay bands upon thee and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another till thou hast ended the days of thy siege 49 take thou also unto thee wheat and barley and beans and lentiles and millet and fitches and put them in one vessel and make thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof 410 and thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight twenty shekels a day from time to time shalt thou eat it 411 thou shalt drink also water by measure the sixth part of an hin from time to time shalt thou drink 412 and thou shalt eat it as barley cakes and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man in their sight 413 and the lord said even thus shall the children of israel eat their defiled bread among the gentiles whither i will drive them 414 then said i ah lord god behold my soul hath not been polluted for from my youth up even till now have i not eaten of that which dieth of itself or is torn in pieces neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth 415 then he said unto me lo i have given thee cows dung for mans dung and thou shalt prepare thy bread therewith 416 moreover he said unto me son of man behold i will break the staff of bread in jerusalem and they shall eat bread by weight and with care and they shall drink water by measure and with astonishment 417 that they may want bread and water and be astonied one with another and consume away for their iniquity 51 and thou son of man take thee a sharp knife take thee a barbers razor and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard then take thee balances to weigh and divide the hair 52 thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled and thou shalt take a third part and smite about it with a knife and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind and i will draw out a sword after them 53 thou shalt also take thereof a few in number and bind them in thy skirts 54 then take of them again and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of israel 55 thus saith the lord god this is jerusalem i have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are round about her 56 and she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her for they have refused my judgments and my statutes they have not walked in them 57 therefore thus saith the lord god because ye multiplied more than the nations that are round about you and have not walked in my statutes neither have kept my judgments neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you 58 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i even i am against thee and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations 59 and i will do in thee that which i have not done and whereunto i will not do any more the like because of all thine abominations 510 therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee and the sons shall eat their fathers and i will execute judgments in thee and the whole remnant of thee will i scatter into all the winds 511 wherefore as i live saith the lord god surely because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things and with all thine abominations therefore will i also diminish thee neither shall mine eye spare neither will i have any pity 512 a third part of thee shall die with the pestilence and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee and i will scatter a third part into all the winds and i will draw out a sword after them 513 thus shall mine anger be accomplished and i will cause my fury to rest upon them and i will be comforted and they shall know that i the lord have spoken it in my zeal when i have accomplished my fury in them 514 moreover i will make thee waste and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee in the sight of all that pass by 515 so it shall be a reproach and a taunt an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about thee when i shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes i the lord have spoken it 516 when i shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine which shall be for their destruction and which i will send to destroy you and i will increase the famine upon you and will break your staff of bread 517 so will i send upon you famine and evil beasts and they shall bereave thee and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee and i will bring the sword upon thee i the lord have spoken it 61 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 62 son of man set thy face toward the mountains of israel and prophesy against them 63 and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys behold i even i will bring a sword upon you and i will destroy your high places 64 and your altars shall be desolate and your images shall be broken and i will cast down your slain men before your idols 65 and i will lay the dead carcases of the children of israel before their idols and i will scatter your bones round about your altars 66 in all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste and the high places shall be desolate that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate and your idols may be broken and cease and your images may be cut down and your works may be abolished 67 and the slain shall fall in the midst of you and ye shall know that i am the lord 68 yet will i leave a remnant that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations when ye shall be scattered through the countries 69 and they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations whither they shall be carried captives because i am broken with their whorish heart which hath departed from me and with their eyes which go a whoring after their idols and they shall lothe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations 610 and they shall know that i am the lord and that i have not said in vain that i would do this evil unto them 611 thus saith the lord god smite with thine hand and stamp with thy foot and say alas for all the evil abominations of the house of israel for they shall fall by the sword by the famine and by the pestilence 612 he that is far off shall die of the pestilence and he that is near shall fall by the sword and he that remaineth and is besieged shall die by the famine thus will i accomplish my fury upon them 613 then shall ye know that i am the lord when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars upon every high hill in all the tops of the mountains and under every green tree and under every thick oak the place where they did offer sweet savour to all their idols 614 so will i stretch out my hand upon them and make the land desolate yea more desolate than the wilderness toward diblath in all their habitations and they shall know that i am the lord 71 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying 72 also thou son of man thus saith the lord god unto the land of israel an end the end is come upon the four corners of the land 73 now is the end come upon thee and i will send mine anger upon thee and will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations 74 and mine eye shall not spare thee neither will i have pity but i will recompense thy ways upon thee and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord 75 thus saith the lord god an evil an only evil behold is come 76 an end is come the end is come it watcheth for thee behold it is come 77 the morning is come unto thee o thou that dwellest in the land the time is come the day of trouble is near and not the sounding again of the mountains 78 now will i shortly pour out my fury upon thee and accomplish mine anger upon thee and i will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense thee for all thine abominations 79 and mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity i will recompense thee according to thy ways and thine abominations that are in the midst of thee and ye shall know that i am the lord that smiteth 710 behold the day behold it is come the morning is gone forth the rod hath blossomed pride hath budded 711 violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness none of them shall remain nor of their multitude nor of any of theirs neither shall there be wailing for them 712 the time is come the day draweth near let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller mourn for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof 713 for the seller shall not return to that which is sold although they were yet alive for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof which shall not return neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life 714 they have blown the trumpet even to make all ready but none goeth to the battle for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof 715 the sword is without and the pestilence and the famine within he that is in the field shall die with the sword and he that is in the city famine and pestilence shall devour him 716 but they that escape of them shall escape and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys all of them mourning every one for his iniquity 717 all hands shall be feeble and all knees shall be weak as water 718 they shall also gird themselves with sackcloth and horror shall cover them and shame shall be upon all faces and baldness upon all their heads 719 they shall cast their silver in the streets and their gold shall be removed their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the lord they shall not satisfy their souls neither fill their bowels because it is the stumblingblock of their iniquity 720 as for the beauty of his ornament he set it in majesty but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein therefore have i set it far from them 721 and i will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil and they shall pollute it 722 my face will i turn also from them and they shall pollute my secret place for the robbers shall enter into it and defile it 723 make a chain for the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence 724 wherefore i will bring the worst of the heathen and they shall possess their houses i will also make the pomp of the strong to cease and their holy places shall be defiled 725 destruction cometh and they shall seek peace and there shall be none 726 mischief shall come upon mischief and rumour shall be upon rumour then shall they seek a vision of the prophet but the law shall perish from the priest and counsel from the ancients 727 the king shall mourn and the prince shall be clothed with desolation and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled i will do unto them after their way and according to their deserts will i judge them and they shall know that i am the lord 81 and it came to pass in the sixth year in the sixth month in the fifth day of the month as i sat in mine house and the elders of judah sat before me that the hand of the lord god fell there upon me 82 then i beheld and lo a likeness as the appearance of fire from the appearance of his loins even downward fire and from his loins even upward as the appearance of brightness as the colour of amber 83 and he put forth the form of an hand and took me by a lock of mine head and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven and brought me in the visions of god to jerusalem to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north where was the seat of the image of jealousy which provoketh to jealousy 84 and behold the glory of the god of israel was there according to the vision that i saw in the plain 85 then said he unto me son of man lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north so i lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry 86 he said furthermore unto me son of man seest thou what they do even the great abominations that the house of israel committeth here that i should go far off from my sanctuary but turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations 87 and he brought me to the door of the court and when i looked behold a hole in the wall 88 then said he unto me son of man dig now in the wall and when i had digged in the wall behold a door 89 and he said unto me go in and behold the wicked abominations that they do here 810 so i went in and saw and behold every form of creeping things and abominable beasts and all the idols of the house of israel pourtrayed upon the wall round about 811 and there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of israel and in the midst of them stood jaazaniah the son of shaphan with every man his censer in his hand and a thick cloud of incense went up 812 then said he unto me son of man hast thou seen what the ancients of the house of israel do in the dark every man in the chambers of his imagery for they say the lord seeth us not the lord hath forsaken the earth 813 he said also unto me turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do 814 then he brought me to the door of the gate of the lords house which was toward the north and behold there sat women weeping for tammuz 815 then said he unto me hast thou seen this o son of man turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations than these 816 and he brought me into the inner court of the lords house and behold at the door of the temple of the lord between the porch and the altar were about five and twenty men with their backs toward the temple of the lord and their faces toward the east and they worshipped the sun toward the east 817 then he said unto me hast thou seen this o son of man is it a light thing to the house of judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here for they have filled the land with violence and have returned to provoke me to anger and lo they put the branch to their nose 818 therefore will i also deal in fury mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice yet will i not hear them 91 he cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying cause them that have charge over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand 92 and behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which lieth toward the north and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writers inkhorn by his side and they went in and stood beside the brasen altar 93 and the glory of the god of israel was gone up from the cherub whereupon he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed with linen which had the writers inkhorn by his side 94 and the lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof 95 and to the others he said in mine hearing go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eye spare neither have ye pity 96 slay utterly old and young both maids and little children and women but come not near any man upon whom is the mark and begin at my sanctuary then they began at the ancient men which were before the house 97 and he said unto them defile the house and fill the courts with the slain go ye forth and they went forth and slew in the city 98 and it came to pass while they were slaying them and i was left that i fell upon my face and cried and said ah lord god wilt thou destroy all the residue of israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon jerusalem 99 then said he unto me the iniquity of the house of israel and judah is exceeding great and the land is full of blood and the city full of perverseness for they say the lord hath forsaken the earth and the lord seeth not 910 and as for me also mine eye shall not spare neither will i have pity but i will recompense their way upon their head 911 and behold the man clothed with linen which had the inkhorn by his side reported the matter saying i have done as thou hast commanded me 101 then i looked and behold in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone as the appearance of the likeness of a throne 102 and he spake unto the man clothed with linen and said go in between the wheels even under the cherub and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims and scatter them over the city and he went in in my sight 103 now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house when the man went in and the cloud filled the inner court 104 then the glory of the lord went up from the cherub and stood over the threshold of the house and the house was filled with the cloud and the court was full of the brightness of the lords glory 105 and the sound of the cherubims wings was heard even to the outer court as the voice of the almighty god when he speaketh 106 and it came to pass that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen saying take fire from between the wheels from between the cherubims then he went in and stood beside the wheels 107 and one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims and took thereof and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen who took it and went out 108 and there appeared in the cherubims the form of a mans hand under their wings 109 and when i looked behold the four wheels by the cherubims one wheel by one cherub and another wheel by another cherub and the appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone 1010 and as for their appearances they four had one likeness as if a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel 1011 when they went they went upon their four sides they turned not as they went but to the place whither the head looked they followed it they turned not as they went 1012 and their whole body and their backs and their hands and their wings and the wheels were full of eyes round about even the wheels that they four had 1013 as for the wheels it was cried unto them in my hearing o wheel 1014 and every one had four faces the first face was the face of a cherub and the second face was the face of a man and the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle 1015 and the cherubims were lifted up this is the living creature that i saw by the river of chebar 1016 and when the cherubims went the wheels went by them and when the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth the same wheels also turned not from beside them 1017 when they stood these stood and when they were lifted up these lifted up themselves also for the spirit of the living creature was in them 1018 then the glory of the lord departed from off the threshold of the house and stood over the cherubims 1019 and the cherubims lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight when they went out the wheels also were beside them and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the lords house and the glory of the god of israel was over them above 1020 this is the living creature that i saw under the god of israel by the river of chebar and i knew that they were the cherubims 1021 every one had four faces apiece and every one four wings and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings 1022 and the likeness of their faces was the same faces which i saw by the river of chebar their appearances and themselves they went every one straight forward 111 moreover the spirit lifted me up and brought me unto the east gate of the lords house which looketh eastward and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men among whom i saw jaazaniah the son of azur and pelatiah the son of benaiah princes of the people 112 then said he unto me son of man these are the men that devise mischief and give wicked counsel in this city 113 which say it is not near let us build houses this city is the caldron and we be the flesh 114 therefore prophesy against them prophesy o son of man 115 and the spirit of the lord fell upon me and said unto me speak thus saith the lord thus have ye said o house of israel for i know the things that come into your mind every one of them 116 ye have multiplied your slain in this city and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain 117 therefore thus saith the lord god your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it they are the flesh and this city is the caldron but i will bring you forth out of the midst of it 118 ye have feared the sword and i will bring a sword upon you saith the lord god 119 and i will bring you out of the midst thereof and deliver you into the hands of strangers and will execute judgments among you 1110 ye shall fall by the sword i will judge you in the border of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord 1111 this city shall not be your caldron neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof but i will judge you in the border of israel 1112 and ye shall know that i am the lord for ye have not walked in my statutes neither executed my judgments but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you 1113 and it came to pass when i prophesied that pelatiah the son of benaiah died then fell i down upon my face and cried with a loud voice and said ah lord god wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of israel 1114 again the word of the lord came unto me saying 1115 son of man thy brethren even thy brethren the men of thy kindred and all the house of israel wholly are they unto whom the inhabitants of jerusalem have said get you far from the lord unto us is this land given in possession 1116 therefore say thus saith the lord god although i have cast them far off among the heathen and although i have scattered them among the countries yet will i be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come 1117 therefore say thus saith the lord god i will even gather you from the people and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered and i will give you the land of israel 1118 and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence 1119 and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit within you and i will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them an heart of flesh 1120 that they may walk in my statutes and keep mine ordinances and do them and they shall be my people and i will be their god 1121 but as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations i will recompense their way upon their own heads saith the lord god 1122 then did the cherubims lift up their wings and the wheels beside them and the glory of the god of israel was over them above 1123 and the glory of the lord went up from the midst of the city and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city 1124 afterwards the spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the spirit of god into chaldea to them of the captivity so the vision that i had seen went up from me 1125 then i spake unto them of the captivity all the things that the lord had shewed me 121 the word of the lord also came unto me saying 122 son of man thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house which have eyes to see and see not they have ears to hear and hear not for they are a rebellious house 123 therefore thou son of man prepare thee stuff for removing and remove by day in their sight and thou shalt remove from thy place to another place in their sight it may be they will consider though they be a rebellious house 124 then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight as stuff for removing and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight as they that go forth into captivity 125 dig thou through the wall in their sight and carry out thereby 126 in their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders and carry it forth in the twilight thou shalt cover thy face that thou see not the ground for i have set thee for a sign unto the house of israel 127 and i did so as i was commanded i brought forth my stuff by day as stuff for captivity and in the even i digged through the wall with mine hand i brought it forth in the twilight and i bare it upon my shoulder in their sight 128 and in the morning came the word of the lord unto me saying 129 son of man hath not the house of israel the rebellious house said unto thee what doest thou 1210 say thou unto them thus saith the lord god this burden concerneth the prince in jerusalem and all the house of israel that are among them 1211 say i am your sign like as i have done so shall it be done unto them they shall remove and go into captivity 1212 and the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder in the twilight and shall go forth they shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby he shall cover his face that he see not the ground with his eyes 1213 my net also will i spread upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and i will bring him to babylon to the land of the chaldeans yet shall he not see it though he shall die there 1214 and i will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him and all his bands and i will draw out the sword after them 1215 and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall scatter them among the nations and disperse them in the countries 1216 but i will leave a few men of them from the sword from the famine and from the pestilence that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come and they shall know that i am the lord 1217 moreover the word of the lord came to me saying 1218 son of man eat thy bread with quaking and drink thy water with trembling and with carefulness 1219 and say unto the people of the land thus saith the lord god of the inhabitants of jerusalem and of the land of israel they shall eat their bread with carefulness and drink their water with astonishment that her land may be desolate from all that is therein because of the violence of all them that dwell therein 1220 and the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste and the land shall be desolate and ye shall know that i am the lord 1221 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 1222 son of man what is that proverb that ye have in the land of israel saying the days are prolonged and every vision faileth 1223 tell them therefore thus saith the lord god i will make this proverb to cease and they shall no more use it as a proverb in israel but say unto them the days are at hand and the effect of every vision 1224 for there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the house of israel 1225 for i am the lord i will speak and the word that i shall speak shall come to pass it shall be no more prolonged for in your days o rebellious house will i say the word and will perform it saith the lord god 1226 again the word of the lord came to me saying 1227 son of man behold they of the house of israel say the vision that he seeth is for many days to come and he prophesieth of the times that are far off 1228 therefore say unto them thus saith the lord god there shall none of my words be prolonged any more but the word which i have spoken shall be done saith the lord god 131 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 132 son of man prophesy against the prophets of israel that prophesy and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own hearts hear ye the word of the lord 133 thus saith the lord god woe unto the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing 134 o israel thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts 135 ye have not gone up into the gaps neither made up the hedge for the house of israel to stand in the battle in the day of the lord 136 they have seen vanity and lying divination saying the lord saith and the lord hath not sent them and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word 137 have ye not seen a vain vision and have ye not spoken a lying divination whereas ye say the lord saith it albeit i have not spoken 138 therefore thus saith the lord god because ye have spoken vanity and seen lies therefore behold i am against you saith the lord god 139 and mine hand shall be upon the prophets that see vanity and that divine lies they shall not be in the assembly of my people neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of israel neither shall they enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord god 1310 because even because they have seduced my people saying peace and there was no peace and one built up a wall and lo others daubed it with untempered morter 1311 say unto them which daub it with untempered morter that it shall fall there shall be an overflowing shower and ye o great hailstones shall fall and a stormy wind shall rend it 1312 lo when the wall is fallen shall it not be said unto you where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it 1313 therefore thus saith the lord god i will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger and great hailstones in my fury to consume it 1314 so will i break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered morter and bring it down to the ground so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered and it shall fall and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i am the lord 1315 thus will i accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon them that have daubed it with untempered morter and will say unto you the wall is no more neither they that daubed it 1316 to wit the prophets of israel which prophesy concerning jerusalem and which see visions of peace for her and there is no peace saith the lord god 1317 likewise thou son of man set thy face against the daughters of thy people which prophesy out of their own heart and prophesy thou against them 1318 and say thus saith the lord god woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls will ye hunt the souls of my people and will ye save the souls alive that come unto you 1319 and will ye pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread to slay the souls that should not die and to save the souls alive that should not live by your lying to my people that hear your lies 1320 wherefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against your pillows wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly and i will tear them from your arms and will let the souls go even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly 1321 your kerchiefs also will i tear and deliver my people out of your hand and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted and ye shall know that i am the lord 1322 because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad whom i have not made sad and strengthened the hands of the wicked that he should not return from his wicked way by promising him life 1323 therefore ye shall see no more vanity nor divine divinations for i will deliver my people out of your hand and ye shall know that i am the lord 141 then came certain of the elders of israel unto me and sat before me 142 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 143 son of man these men have set up their idols in their heart and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face should i be enquired of at all by them 144 therefore speak unto them and say unto them thus saith the lord god every man of the house of israel that setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to the prophet i the lord will answer him that cometh according to the multitude of his idols 145 that i may take the house of israel in their own heart because they are all estranged from me through their idols 146 therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god repent and turn yourselves from your idols and turn away your faces from all your abominations 147 for every one of the house of israel or of the stranger that sojourneth in israel which separateth himself from me and setteth up his idols in his heart and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and cometh to a prophet to enquire of him concerning me i the lord will answer him by myself 148 and i will set my face against that man and will make him a sign and a proverb and i will cut him off from the midst of my people and ye shall know that i am the lord 149 and if the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing i the lord have deceived that prophet and i will stretch out my hand upon him and will destroy him from the midst of my people israel 1410 and they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeketh unto him 1411 that the house of israel may go no more astray from me neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions but that they may be my people and i may be their god saith the lord god 1412 the word of the lord came again to me saying 1413 son of man when the land sinneth against me by trespassing grievously then will i stretch out mine hand upon it and will break the staff of the bread thereof and will send famine upon it and will cut off man and beast from it 1414 though these three men noah daniel and job were in it they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness saith the lord god 1415 if i cause noisome beasts to pass through the land and they spoil it so that it be desolate that no man may pass through because of the beasts 1416 though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters they only shall be delivered but the land shall be desolate 1417 or if i bring a sword upon that land and say sword go through the land so that i cut off man and beast from it 1418 though these three men were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters but they only shall be delivered themselves 1419 or if i send a pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon it in blood to cut off from it man and beast 1420 though noah daniel and job were in it as i live saith the lord god they shall deliver neither son nor daughter they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness 1421 for thus saith the lord god how much more when i send my four sore judgments upon jerusalem the sword and the famine and the noisome beast and the pestilence to cut off from it man and beast 1422 yet behold therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth both sons and daughters behold they shall come forth unto you and ye shall see their way and their doings and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that i have brought upon jerusalem even concerning all that i have brought upon it 1423 and they shall comfort you when ye see their ways and their doings and ye shall know that i have not done without cause all that i have done in it saith the lord god 151 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 152 son of man what is the vine tree more than any tree or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest 153 shall wood be taken thereof to do any work or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon 154 behold it is cast into the fire for fuel the fire devoureth both the ends of it and the midst of it is burned is it meet for any work 155 behold when it was whole it was meet for no work how much less shall it be meet yet for any work when the fire hath devoured it and it is burned 156 therefore thus saith the lord god as the vine tree among the trees of the forest which i have given to the fire for fuel so will i give the inhabitants of jerusalem 157 and i will set my face against them they shall go out from one fire and another fire shall devour them and ye shall know that i am the lord when i set my face against them 158 and i will make the land desolate because they have committed a trespass saith the lord god 161 again the word of the lord came unto me saying 162 son of man cause jerusalem to know her abominations 163 and say thus saith the lord god unto jerusalem thy birth and thy nativity is of the land of canaan thy father was an amorite and thy mother an hittite 164 and as for thy nativity in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee thou wast not salted at all nor swaddled at all 165 none eye pitied thee to do any of these unto thee to have compassion upon thee but thou wast cast out in the open field to the lothing of thy person in the day that thou wast born 166 and when i passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine own blood i said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood live yea i said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood live 167 i have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field and thou hast increased and waxen great and thou art come to excellent ornaments thy breasts are fashioned and thine hair is grown whereas thou wast naked and bare 168 now when i passed by thee and looked upon thee behold thy time was the time of love and i spread my skirt over thee and covered thy nakedness yea i sware unto thee and entered into a covenant with thee saith the lord god and thou becamest mine 169 then washed i thee with water yea i throughly washed away thy blood from thee and i anointed thee with oil 1610 i clothed thee also with broidered work and shod thee with badgers skin and i girded thee about with fine linen and i covered thee with silk 1611 i decked thee also with ornaments and i put bracelets upon thy hands and a chain on thy neck 1612 and i put a jewel on thy forehead and earrings in thine ears and a beautiful crown upon thine head 1613 thus wast thou decked with gold and silver and thy raiment was of fine linen and silk and broidered work thou didst eat fine flour and honey and oil and thou wast exceeding beautiful and thou didst prosper into a kingdom 1614 and thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty for it was perfect through my comeliness which i had put upon thee saith the lord god 1615 but thou didst trust in thine own beauty and playedst the harlot because of thy renown and pouredst out thy fornications on every one that passed by his it was 1616 and of thy garments thou didst take and deckedst thy high places with divers colours and playedst the harlot thereupon the like things shall not come neither shall it be so 1617 thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my silver which i had given thee and madest to thyself images of men and didst commit whoredom with them 1618 and tookest thy broidered garments and coveredst them and thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them 1619 my meat also which i gave thee fine flour and oil and honey wherewith i fed thee thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour and thus it was saith the lord god 1620 moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters whom thou hast borne unto me and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be devoured is this of thy whoredoms a small matter 1621 that thou hast slain my children and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them 1622 and in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth when thou wast naked and bare and wast polluted in thy blood 1623 and it came to pass after all thy wickedness woe woe unto thee saith the lord god 1624 that thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place and hast made thee an high place in every street 1625 thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way and hast made thy beauty to be abhorred and hast opened thy feet to every one that passed by and multiplied thy whoredoms 1626 thou hast also committed fornication with the egyptians thy neighbours great of flesh and hast increased thy whoredoms to provoke me to anger 1627 behold therefore i have stretched out my hand over thee and have diminished thine ordinary food and delivered thee unto the will of them that hate thee the daughters of the philistines which are ashamed of thy lewd way 1628 thou hast played the whore also with the assyrians because thou wast unsatiable yea thou hast played the harlot with them and yet couldest not be satisfied 1629 thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of canaan unto chaldea and yet thou wast not satisfied therewith 1630 how weak is thine heart saith the lord god seeing thou doest all these things the work of an imperious whorish woman 1631 in that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every way and makest thine high place in every street and hast not been as an harlot in that thou scornest hire 1632 but as a wife that committeth adultery which taketh strangers instead of her husband 1633 they give gifts to all whores but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers and hirest them that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom 1634 and the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms and in that thou givest a reward and no reward is given unto thee therefore thou art contrary 1635 wherefore o harlot hear the word of the lord 1636 thus saith the lord god because thy filthiness was poured out and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers and with all the idols of thy abominations and by the blood of thy children which thou didst give unto them 1637 behold therefore i will gather all thy lovers with whom thou hast taken pleasure and all them that thou hast loved with all them that thou hast hated i will even gather them round about against thee and will discover thy nakedness unto them that they may see all thy nakedness 1638 and i will judge thee as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged and i will give thee blood in fury and jealousy 1639 and i will also give thee into their hand and they shall throw down thine eminent place and shall break down thy high places they shall strip thee also of thy clothes and shall take thy fair jewels and leave thee naked and bare 1640 they shall also bring up a company against thee and they shall stone thee with stones and thrust thee through with their swords 1641 and they shall burn thine houses with fire and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women and i will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot and thou also shalt give no hire any more 1642 so will i make my fury toward thee to rest and my jealousy shall depart from thee and i will be quiet and will be no more angry 1643 because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth but hast fretted me in all these things behold therefore i also will recompense thy way upon thine head saith the lord god and thou shalt not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations 1644 behold every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb against thee saying as is the mother so is her daughter 1645 thou art thy mothers daughter that lotheth her husband and her children and thou art the sister of thy sisters which lothed their husbands and their children your mother was an hittite and your father an amorite 1646 and thine elder sister is samaria she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand is sodom and her daughters 1647 yet hast thou not walked after their ways nor done after their abominations but as if that were a very little thing thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways 1648 as i live saith the lord god sodom thy sister hath not done she nor her daughters as thou hast done thou and thy daughters 1649 behold this was the iniquity of thy sister sodom pride fulness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy 1650 and they were haughty and committed abomination before me therefore i took them away as i saw good 1651 neither hath samaria committed half of thy sins but thou hast multiplied thine abominations more than they and hast justified thy sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done 1652 thou also which hast judged thy sisters bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they they are more righteous than thou yea be thou confounded also and bear thy shame in that thou hast justified thy sisters 1653 when i shall bring again their captivity the captivity of sodom and her daughters and the captivity of samaria and her daughters then will i bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them 1654 that thou mayest bear thine own shame and mayest be confounded in all that thou hast done in that thou art a comfort unto them 1655 when thy sisters sodom and her daughters shall return to their former estate and samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former estate 1656 for thy sister sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day of thy pride 1657 before thy wickedness was discovered as at the time of thy reproach of the daughters of syria and all that are round about her the daughters of the philistines which despise thee round about 1658 thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations saith the lord 1659 for thus saith the lord god i will even deal with thee as thou hast done which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant 1660 nevertheless i will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth and i will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant 1661 then thou shalt remember thy ways and be ashamed when thou shalt receive thy sisters thine elder and thy younger and i will give them unto thee for daughters but not by thy covenant 1662 and i will establish my covenant with thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord 1663 that thou mayest remember and be confounded and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame when i am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done saith the lord god 171 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 172 son of man put forth a riddle and speak a parable unto the house of israel 173 and say thus saith the lord god a great eagle with great wings longwinged full of feathers which had divers colours came unto lebanon and took the highest branch of the cedar 174 he cropped off the top of his young twigs and carried it into a land of traffick he set it in a city of merchants 175 he took also of the seed of the land and planted it in a fruitful field he placed it by great waters and set it as a willow tree 176 and it grew and became a spreading vine of low stature whose branches turned toward him and the roots thereof were under him so it became a vine and brought forth branches and shot forth sprigs 177 there was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers and behold this vine did bend her roots toward him and shot forth her branches toward him that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation 178 it was planted in a good soil by great waters that it might bring forth branches and that it might bear fruit that it might be a goodly vine 179 say thou thus saith the lord god shall it prosper shall he not pull up the roots thereof and cut off the fruit thereof that it wither it shall wither in all the leaves of her spring even without great power or many people to pluck it up by the roots thereof 1710 yea behold being planted shall it prosper shall it not utterly wither when the east wind toucheth it it shall wither in the furrows where it grew 1711 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying 1712 say now to the rebellious house know ye not what these things mean tell them behold the king of babylon is come to jerusalem and hath taken the king thereof and the princes thereof and led them with him to babylon 1713 and hath taken of the kings seed and made a covenant with him and hath taken an oath of him he hath also taken the mighty of the land 1714 that the kingdom might be base that it might not lift itself up but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand 1715 but he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into egypt that they might give him horses and much people shall he prosper shall he escape that doeth such things or shall he break the covenant and be delivered 1716 as i live saith the lord god surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king whose oath he despised and whose covenant he brake even with him in the midst of babylon he shall die 1717 neither shall pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war by casting up mounts and building forts to cut off many persons 1718 seeing he despised the oath by breaking the covenant when lo he had given his hand and hath done all these things he shall not escape 1719 therefore thus saith the lord god as i live surely mine oath that he hath despised and my covenant that he hath broken even it will i recompense upon his own head 1720 and i will spread my net upon him and he shall be taken in my snare and i will bring him to babylon and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me 1721 and all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds and ye shall know that i the lord have spoken it 1722 thus saith the lord god i will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar and will set it i will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one and will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent 1723 in the mountain of the height of israel will i plant it and it shall bring forth boughs and bear fruit and be a goodly cedar and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell 1724 and all the trees of the field shall know that i the lord have brought down the high tree have exalted the low tree have dried up the green tree and have made the dry tree to flourish i the lord have spoken and have done it 181 the word of the lord came unto me again saying 182 what mean ye that ye use this proverb concerning the land of israel saying the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge 183 as i live saith the lord god ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in israel 184 behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine the soul that sinneth it shall die 185 but if a man be just and do that which is lawful and right 186 and hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel neither hath defiled his neighbours wife neither hath come near to a menstruous woman 187 and hath not oppressed any but hath restored to the debtor his pledge hath spoiled none by violence hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment 188 he that hath not given forth upon usury neither hath taken any increase that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity hath executed true judgment between man and man 189 hath walked in my statutes and hath kept my judgments to deal truly he is just he shall surely live saith the lord god 1810 if he beget a son that is a robber a shedder of blood and that doeth the like to any one of these things 1811 and that doeth not any of those duties but even hath eaten upon the mountains and defiled his neighbours wife 1812 hath oppressed the poor and needy hath spoiled by violence hath not restored the pledge and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols hath committed abomination 1813 hath given forth upon usury and hath taken increase shall he then live he shall not live he hath done all these abominations he shall surely die his blood shall be upon him 1814 now lo if he beget a son that seeth all his fathers sins which he hath done and considereth and doeth not such like 1815 that hath not eaten upon the mountains neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of israel hath not defiled his neighbours wife 1816 neither hath oppressed any hath not withholden the pledge neither hath spoiled by violence but hath given his bread to the hungry and hath covered the naked with a garment 1817 that hath taken off his hand from the poor that hath not received usury nor increase hath executed my judgments hath walked in my statutes he shall not die for the iniquity of his father he shall surely live 1818 as for his father because he cruelly oppressed spoiled his brother by violence and did that which is not good among his people lo even he shall die in his iniquity 1819 yet say ye why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father when the son hath done that which is lawful and right and hath kept all my statutes and hath done them he shall surely live 1820 the soul that sinneth it shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him 1821 but if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed and keep all my statutes and do that which is lawful and right he shall surely live he shall not die 1822 all his transgressions that he hath committed they shall not be mentioned unto him in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live 1823 have i any pleasure at all that the wicked should die saith the lord god and not that he should return from his ways and live 1824 but when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth shall he live all his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned in his trespass that he hath trespassed and in his sin that he hath sinned in them shall he die 1825 yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal hear now o house of israel is not my way equal are not your ways unequal 1826 when a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness and committeth iniquity and dieth in them for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die 1827 again when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed and doeth that which is lawful and right he shall save his soul alive 1828 because he considereth and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed he shall surely live he shall not die 1829 yet saith the house of israel the way of the lord is not equal o house of israel are not my ways equal are not your ways unequal 1830 therefore i will judge you o house of israel every one according to his ways saith the lord god repent and turn yourselves from all your transgressions so iniquity shall not be your ruin 1831 cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will ye die o house of israel 1832 for i have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith the lord god wherefore turn yourselves and live ye 191 moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of israel 192 and say what is thy mother a lioness she lay down among lions she nourished her whelps among young lions 193 and she brought up one of her whelps it became a young lion and it learned to catch the prey it devoured men 194 the nations also heard of him he was taken in their pit and they brought him with chains unto the land of egypt 195 now when she saw that she had waited and her hope was lost then she took another of her whelps and made him a young lion 196 and he went up and down among the lions he became a young lion and learned to catch the prey and devoured men 197 and he knew their desolate palaces and he laid waste their cities and the land was desolate and the fulness thereof by the noise of his roaring 198 then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces and spread their net over him he was taken in their pit 199 and they put him in ward in chains and brought him to the king of babylon they brought him into holds that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of israel 1910 thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the waters she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters 1911 and she had strong rods for the sceptres of them that bare rule and her stature was exalted among the thick branches and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches 1912 but she was plucked up in fury she was cast down to the ground and the east wind dried up her fruit her strong rods were broken and withered the fire consumed them 1913 and now she is planted in the wilderness in a dry and thirsty ground 1914 and fire is gone out of a rod of her branches which hath devoured her fruit so that she hath no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule this is a lamentation and shall be for a lamentation 201 and it came to pass in the seventh year in the fifth month the tenth day of the month that certain of the elders of israel came to enquire of the lord and sat before me 202 then came the word of the lord unto me saying 203 son of man speak unto the elders of israel and say unto them thus saith the lord god are ye come to enquire of me as i live saith the lord god i will not be enquired of by you 204 wilt thou judge them son of man wilt thou judge them cause them to know the abominations of their fathers 205 and say unto them thus saith the lord god in the day when i chose israel and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of jacob and made myself known unto them in the land of egypt when i lifted up mine hand unto them saying i am the lord your god 206 in the day that i lifted up mine hand unto them to bring them forth of the land of egypt into a land that i had espied for them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands 207 then said i unto them cast ye away every man the abominations of his eyes and defile not yourselves with the idols of egypt i am the lord your god 208 but they rebelled against me and would not hearken unto me they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes neither did they forsake the idols of egypt then i said i will pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of egypt 209 but i wrought for my names sake that it should not be polluted before the heathen among whom they were in whose sight i made myself known unto them in bringing them forth out of the land of egypt 2010 wherefore i caused them to go forth out of the land of egypt and brought them into the wilderness 2011 and i gave them my statutes and shewed them my judgments which if a man do he shall even live in them 2012 moreover also i gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them that they might know that i am the lord that sanctify them 2013 but the house of israel rebelled against me in the wilderness they walked not in my statutes and they despised my judgments which if a man do he shall even live in them and my sabbaths they greatly polluted then i said i would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness to consume them 2014 but i wrought for my names sake that it should not be polluted before the heathen in whose sight i brought them out 2015 yet also i lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness that i would not bring them into the land which i had given them flowing with milk and honey which is the glory of all lands 2016 because they despised my judgments and walked not in my statutes but polluted my sabbaths for their heart went after their idols 2017 nevertheless mine eye spared them from destroying them neither did i make an end of them in the wilderness 2018 but i said unto their children in the wilderness walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers neither observe their judgments nor defile yourselves with their idols 2019 i am the lord your god walk in my statutes and keep my judgments and do them 2020 and hallow my sabbaths and they shall be a sign between me and you that ye may know that i am the lord your god 2021 notwithstanding the children rebelled against me they walked not in my statutes neither kept my judgments to do them which if a man do he shall even live in them they polluted my sabbaths then i said i would pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness 2022 nevertheless i withdrew mine hand and wrought for my names sake that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen in whose sight i brought them forth 2023 i lifted up mine hand unto them also in the wilderness that i would scatter them among the heathen and disperse them through the countries 2024 because they had not executed my judgments but had despised my statutes and had polluted my sabbaths and their eyes were after their fathers idols 2025 wherefore i gave them also statutes that were not good and judgments whereby they should not live 2026 and i polluted them in their own gifts in that they caused to pass through the fire all that openeth the womb that i might make them desolate to the end that they might know that i am the lord 2027 therefore son of man speak unto the house of israel and say unto them thus saith the lord god yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me in that they have committed a trespass against me 2028 for when i had brought them into the land for the which i lifted up mine hand to give it to them then they saw every high hill and all the thick trees and they offered there their sacrifices and there they presented the provocation of their offering there also they made their sweet savour and poured out there their drink offerings 2029 then i said unto them what is the high place whereunto ye go and the name whereof is called bamah unto this day 2030 wherefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers and commit ye whoredom after their abominations 2031 for when ye offer your gifts when ye make your sons to pass through the fire ye pollute yourselves with all your idols even unto this day and shall i be enquired of by you o house of israel as i live saith the lord god i will not be enquired of by you 2032 and that which cometh into your mind shall not be at all that ye say we will be as the heathen as the families of the countries to serve wood and stone 2033 as i live saith the lord god surely with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out will i rule over you 2034 and i will bring you out from the people and will gather you out of the countries wherein ye are scattered with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out 2035 and i will bring you into the wilderness of the people and there will i plead with you face to face 2036 like as i pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of egypt so will i plead with you saith the lord god 2037 and i will cause you to pass under the rod and i will bring you into the bond of the covenant 2038 and i will purge out from among you the rebels and them that transgress against me i will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn and they shall not enter into the land of israel and ye shall know that i am the lord 2039 as for you o house of israel thus saith the lord god go ye serve ye every one his idols and hereafter also if ye will not hearken unto me but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts and with your idols 2040 for in mine holy mountain in the mountain of the height of israel saith the lord god there shall all the house of israel all of them in the land serve me there will i accept them and there will i require your offerings and the firstfruits of your oblations with all your holy things 2041 i will accept you with your sweet savour when i bring you out from the people and gather you out of the countries wherein ye have been scattered and i will be sanctified in you before the heathen 2042 and ye shall know that i am the lord when i shall bring you into the land of israel into the country for the which i lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers 2043 and there shall ye remember your ways and all your doings wherein ye have been defiled and ye shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed 2044 and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have wrought with you for my names sake not according to your wicked ways nor according to your corrupt doings o ye house of israel saith the lord god 2045 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying 2046 son of man set thy face toward the south and drop thy word toward the south and prophesy against the forest of the south field 2047 and say to the forest of the south hear the word of the lord thus saith the lord god behold i will kindle a fire in thee and it shall devour every green tree in thee and every dry tree the flaming flame shall not be quenched and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein 2048 and all flesh shall see that i the lord have kindled it it shall not be quenched 2049 then said i ah lord god they say of me doth he not speak parables 211 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 212 son of man set thy face toward jerusalem and drop thy word toward the holy places and prophesy against the land of israel 213 and say to the land of israel thus saith the lord behold i am against thee and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath and will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked 214 seeing then that i will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north 215 that all flesh may know that i the lord have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath it shall not return any more 216 sigh therefore thou son of man with the breaking of thy loins and with bitterness sigh before their eyes 217 and it shall be when they say unto thee wherefore sighest thou that thou shalt answer for the tidings because it cometh and every heart shall melt and all hands shall be feeble and every spirit shall faint and all knees shall be weak as water behold it cometh and shall be brought to pass saith the lord god 218 again the word of the lord came unto me saying 219 son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord say a sword a sword is sharpened and also furbished 2110 it is sharpened to make a sore slaughter it is furbished that it may glitter should we then make mirth it contemneth the rod of my son as every tree 2111 and he hath given it to be furbished that it may be handled this sword is sharpened and it is furbished to give it into the hand of the slayer 2112 cry and howl son of man for it shall be upon my people it shall be upon all the princes of israel terrors by reason of the sword shall be upon my people smite therefore upon thy thigh 2113 because it is a trial and what if the sword contemn even the rod it shall be no more saith the lord god 2114 thou therefore son of man prophesy and smite thine hands together and let the sword be doubled the third time the sword of the slain it is the sword of the great men that are slain which entereth into their privy chambers 2115 i have set the point of the sword against all their gates that their heart may faint and their ruins be multiplied ah it is made bright it is wrapped up for the slaughter 2116 go thee one way or other either on the right hand or on the left whithersoever thy face is set 2117 i will also smite mine hands together and i will cause my fury to rest i the lord have said it 2118 the word of the lord came unto me again saying 2119 also thou son of man appoint thee two ways that the sword of the king of babylon may come both twain shall come forth out of one land and choose thou a place choose it at the head of the way to the city 2120 appoint a way that the sword may come to rabbath of the ammonites and to judah in jerusalem the defenced 2121 for the king of babylon stood at the parting of the way at the head of the two ways to use divination he made his arrows bright he consulted with images he looked in the liver 2122 at his right hand was the divination for jerusalem to appoint captains to open the mouth in the slaughter to lift up the voice with shouting to appoint battering rams against the gates to cast a mount and to build a fort 2123 and it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight to them that have sworn oaths but he will call to remembrance the iniquity that they may be taken 2124 therefore thus saith the lord god because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered in that your transgressions are discovered so that in all your doings your sins do appear because i say that ye are come to remembrance ye shall be taken with the hand 2125 and thou profane wicked prince of israel whose day is come when iniquity shall have an end 2126 thus saith the lord god remove the diadem and take off the crown this shall not be the same exalt him that is low and abase him that is high 2127 i will overturn overturn overturn it and it shall be no more until he come whose right it is and i will give it him 2128 and thou son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god concerning the ammonites and concerning their reproach even say thou the sword the sword is drawn for the slaughter it is furbished to consume because of the glittering 2129 whiles they see vanity unto thee whiles they divine a lie unto thee to bring thee upon the necks of them that are slain of the wicked whose day is come when their iniquity shall have an end 2130 shall i cause it to return into his sheath i will judge thee in the place where thou wast created in the land of thy nativity 2131 and i will pour out mine indignation upon thee i will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath and deliver thee into the hand of brutish men and skilful to destroy 2132 thou shalt be for fuel to the fire thy blood shall be in the midst of the land thou shalt be no more remembered for i the lord have spoken it 221 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying 222 now thou son of man wilt thou judge wilt thou judge the bloody city yea thou shalt shew her all her abominations 223 then say thou thus saith the lord god the city sheddeth blood in the midst of it that her time may come and maketh idols against herself to defile herself 224 thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made and thou hast caused thy days to draw near and art come even unto thy years therefore have i made thee a reproach unto the heathen and a mocking to all countries 225 those that be near and those that be far from thee shall mock thee which art infamous and much vexed 226 behold the princes of israel every one were in thee to their power to shed blood 227 in thee have they set light by father and mother in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow 228 thou hast despised mine holy things and hast profaned my sabbaths 229 in thee are men that carry tales to shed blood and in thee they eat upon the mountains in the midst of thee they commit lewdness 2210 in thee have they discovered their fathers nakedness in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution 2211 and one hath committed abomination with his neighbours wife and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law and another in thee hath humbled his sister his fathers daughter 2212 in thee have they taken gifts to shed blood thou hast taken usury and increase and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion and hast forgotten me saith the lord god 2213 behold therefore i have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee 2214 can thine heart endure or can thine hands be strong in the days that i shall deal with thee i the lord have spoken it and will do it 2215 and i will scatter thee among the heathen and disperse thee in the countries and will consume thy filthiness out of thee 2216 and thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen and thou shalt know that i am the lord 2217 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 2218 son of man the house of israel is to me become dross all they are brass and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace they are even the dross of silver 2219 therefore thus saith the lord god because ye are all become dross behold therefore i will gather you into the midst of jerusalem 2220 as they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it to melt it so will i gather you in mine anger and in my fury and i will leave you there and melt you 2221 yea i will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath and ye shall be melted in the midst therof 2222 as silver is melted in the midst of the furnace so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof and ye shall know that i the lord have poured out my fury upon you 2223 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 2224 son of man say unto her thou art the land that is not cleansed nor rained upon in the day of indignation 2225 there is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof like a roaring lion ravening the prey they have devoured souls they have taken the treasure and precious things they have made her many widows in the midst thereof 2226 her priests have violated my law and have profaned mine holy things they have put no difference between the holy and profane neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths and i am profaned among them 2227 her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood and to destroy souls to get dishonest gain 2228 and her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter seeing vanity and divining lies unto them saying thus saith the lord god when the lord hath not spoken 2229 the people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery and have vexed the poor and needy yea they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully 2230 and i sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that i should not destroy it but i found none 2231 therefore have i poured out mine indignation upon them i have consumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way have i recompensed upon their heads saith the lord god 231 the word of the lord came again unto me saying 232 son of man there were two women the daughters of one mother 233 and they committed whoredoms in egypt they committed whoredoms in their youth there were their breasts pressed and there they bruised the teats of their virginity 234 and the names of them were aholah the elder and aholibah her sister and they were mine and they bare sons and daughters thus were their names samaria is aholah and jerusalem aholibah 235 and aholah played the harlot when she was mine and she doted on her lovers on the assyrians her neighbours 236 which were clothed with blue captains and rulers all of them desirable young men horsemen riding upon horses 237 thus she committed her whoredoms with them with all them that were the chosen men of assyria and with all on whom she doted with all their idols she defiled herself 238 neither left she her whoredoms brought from egypt for in her youth they lay with her and they bruised the breasts of her virginity and poured their whoredom upon her 239 wherefore i have delivered her into the hand of her lovers into the hand of the assyrians upon whom she doted 2310 these discovered her nakedness they took her sons and her daughters and slew her with the sword and she became famous among women for they had executed judgment upon her 2311 and when her sister aholibah saw this she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms 2312 she doted upon the assyrians her neighbours captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously horsemen riding upon horses all of them desirable young men 2313 then i saw that she was defiled that they took both one way 2314 and that she increased her whoredoms for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall the images of the chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion 2315 girded with girdles upon their loins exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads all of them princes to look to after the manner of the babylonians of chaldea the land of their nativity 2316 and as soon as she saw them with her eyes she doted upon them and sent messengers unto them into chaldea 2317 and the babylonians came to her into the bed of love and they defiled her with their whoredom and she was polluted with them and her mind was alienated from them 2318 so she discovered her whoredoms and discovered her nakedness then my mind was alienated from her like as my mind was alienated from her sister 2319 yet she multiplied her whoredoms in calling to remembrance the days of her youth wherein she had played the harlot in the land of egypt 2320 for she doted upon their paramours whose flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue is like the issue of horses 2321 thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth in bruising thy teats by the egyptians for the paps of thy youth 2322 therefore o aholibah thus saith the lord god behold i will raise up thy lovers against thee from whom thy mind is alienated and i will bring them against thee on every side 2323 the babylonians and all the chaldeans pekod and shoa and koa and all the assyrians with them all of them desirable young men captains and rulers great lords and renowned all of them riding upon horses 2324 and they shall come against thee with chariots wagons and wheels and with an assembly of people which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about and i will set judgment before them and they shall judge thee according to their judgments 2325 and i will set my jealousy against thee and they shall deal furiously with thee they shall take away thy nose and thine ears and thy remnant shall fall by the sword they shall take thy sons and thy daughters and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire 2326 they shall also strip thee out of thy clothes and take away thy fair jewels 2327 thus will i make thy lewdness to cease from thee and thy whoredom brought from the land of egypt so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them nor remember egypt any more 2328 for thus saith the lord god behold i will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated 2329 and they shall deal with thee hatefully and shall take away all thy labour and shall leave thee naked and bare and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be discovered both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms 2330 i will do these things unto thee because thou hast gone a whoring after the heathen and because thou art polluted with their idols 2331 thou hast walked in the way of thy sister therefore will i give her cup into thine hand 2332 thus saith the lord god thou shalt drink of thy sisters cup deep and large thou shalt be laughed to scorn and had in derision it containeth much 2333 thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow with the cup of astonishment and desolation with the cup of thy sister samaria 2334 thou shalt even drink it and suck it out and thou shalt break the sherds thereof and pluck off thine own breasts for i have spoken it saith the lord god 2335 therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast forgotten me and cast me behind thy back therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms 2336 the lord said moreover unto me son of man wilt thou judge aholah and aholibah yea declare unto them their abominations 2337 that they have committed adultery and blood is in their hands and with their idols have they committed adultery and have also caused their sons whom they bare unto me to pass for them through the fire to devour them 2338 moreover this they have done unto me they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day and have profaned my sabbaths 2339 for when they had slain their children to their idols then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it and lo thus have they done in the midst of mine house 2340 and furthermore that ye have sent for men to come from far unto whom a messenger was sent and lo they came for whom thou didst wash thyself paintedst thy eyes and deckedst thyself with ornaments 2341 and satest upon a stately bed and a table prepared before it whereupon thou hast set mine incense and mine oil 2342 and a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her and with the men of the common sort were brought sabeans from the wilderness which put bracelets upon their hands and beautiful crowns upon their heads 2343 then said i unto her that was old in adulteries will they now commit whoredoms with her and she with them 2344 yet they went in unto her as they go in unto a woman that playeth the harlot so went they in unto aholah and unto aholibah the lewd women 2345 and the righteous men they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses and after the manner of women that shed blood because they are adulteresses and blood is in their hands 2346 for thus saith the lord god i will bring up a company upon them and will give them to be removed and spoiled 2347 and the company shall stone them with stones and dispatch them with their swords they shall slay their sons and their daughters and burn up their houses with fire 2348 thus will i cause lewdness to cease out of the land that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness 2349 and they shall recompense your lewdness upon you and ye shall bear the sins of your idols and ye shall know that i am the lord god 241 again in the ninth year in the tenth month in the tenth day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying 242 son of man write thee the name of the day even of this same day the king of babylon set himself against jerusalem this same day 243 and utter a parable unto the rebellious house and say unto them thus saith the lord god set on a pot set it on and also pour water into it 244 gather the pieces thereof into it even every good piece the thigh and the shoulder fill it with the choice bones 245 take the choice of the flock and burn also the bones under it and make it boil well and let them seethe the bones of it therein 246 wherefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city to the pot whose scum is therein and whose scum is not gone out of it bring it out piece by piece let no lot fall upon it 247 for her blood is in the midst of her she set it upon the top of a rock she poured it not upon the ground to cover it with dust 248 that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance i have set her blood upon the top of a rock that it should not be covered 249 therefore thus saith the lord god woe to the bloody city i will even make the pile for fire great 2410 heap on wood kindle the fire consume the flesh and spice it well and let the bones be burned 2411 then set it empty upon the coals thereof that the brass of it may be hot and may burn and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it that the scum of it may be consumed 2412 she hath wearied herself with lies and her great scum went not forth out of her her scum shall be in the fire 2413 in thy filthiness is lewdness because i have purged thee and thou wast not purged thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more till i have caused my fury to rest upon thee 2414 i the lord have spoken it it shall come to pass and i will do it i will not go back neither will i spare neither will i repent according to thy ways and according to thy doings shall they judge thee saith the lord god 2415 also the word of the lord came unto me saying 2416 son of man behold i take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep neither shall thy tears run down 2417 forbear to cry make no mourning for the dead bind the tire of thine head upon thee and put on thy shoes upon thy feet and cover not thy lips and eat not the bread of men 2418 so i spake unto the people in the morning and at even my wife died and i did in the morning as i was commanded 2419 and the people said unto me wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us that thou doest so 2420 then i answered them the word of the lord came unto me saying 2421 speak unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god behold i will profane my sanctuary the excellency of your strength the desire of your eyes and that which your soul pitieth and your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword 2422 and ye shall do as i have done ye shall not cover your lips nor eat the bread of men 2423 and your tires shall be upon your heads and your shoes upon your feet ye shall not mourn nor weep but ye shall pine away for your iniquities and mourn one toward another 2424 thus ezekiel is unto you a sign according to all that he hath done shall ye do and when this cometh ye shall know that i am the lord god 2425 also thou son of man shall it not be in the day when i take from them their strength the joy of their glory the desire of their eyes and that whereupon they set their minds their sons and their daughters 2426 that he that escapeth in that day shall come unto thee to cause thee to hear it with thine ears 2427 in that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped and thou shalt speak and be no more dumb and thou shalt be a sign unto them and they shall know that i am the lord 251 the word of the lord came again unto me saying 252 son of man set thy face against the ammonites and prophesy against them 253 and say unto the ammonites hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god because thou saidst aha against my sanctuary when it was profaned and against the land of israel when it was desolate and against the house of judah when they went into captivity 254 behold therefore i will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession and they shall set their palaces in thee and make their dwellings in thee they shall eat thy fruit and they shall drink thy milk 255 and i will make rabbah a stable for camels and the ammonites a couching place for flocks and ye shall know that i am the lord 256 for thus saith the lord god because thou hast clapped thine hands and stamped with the feet and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of israel 257 behold therefore i will stretch out mine hand upon thee and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen and i will cut thee off from the people and i will cause thee to perish out of the countries i will destroy thee and thou shalt know that i am the lord 258 thus saith the lord god because that moab and seir do say behold the house of judah is like unto all the heathen 259 therefore behold i will open the side of moab from the cities from his cities which are on his frontiers the glory of the country bethjeshimoth baalmeon and kiriathaim 2510 unto the men of the east with the ammonites and will give them in possession that the ammonites may not be remembered among the nations 2511 and i will execute judgments upon moab and they shall know that i am the lord 2512 thus saith the lord god because that edom hath dealt against the house of judah by taking vengeance and hath greatly offended and revenged himself upon them 2513 therefore thus saith the lord god i will also stretch out mine hand upon edom and will cut off man and beast from it and i will make it desolate from teman and they of dedan shall fall by the sword 2514 and i will lay my vengeance upon edom by the hand of my people israel and they shall do in edom according to mine anger and according to my fury and they shall know my vengeance saith the lord god 2515 thus saith the lord god because the philistines have dealt by revenge and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart to destroy it for the old hatred 2516 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will stretch out mine hand upon the philistines and i will cut off the cherethims and destroy the remnant of the sea coast 2517 and i will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall lay my vengeance upon them 261 and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying 262 son of man because that tyrus hath said against jerusalem aha she is broken that was the gates of the people she is turned unto me i shall be replenished now she is laid waste 263 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o tyrus and will cause many nations to come up against thee as the sea causeth his waves to come up 264 and they shall destroy the walls of tyrus and break down her towers i will also scrape her dust from her and make her like the top of a rock 265 it shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea for i have spoken it saith the lord god and it shall become a spoil to the nations 266 and her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword and they shall know that i am the lord 267 for thus saith the lord god behold i will bring upon tyrus nebuchadrezzar king of babylon a king of kings from the north with horses and with chariots and with horsemen and companies and much people 268 he shall slay with the sword thy daughters in the field and he shall make a fort against thee and cast a mount against thee and lift up the buckler against thee 269 and he shall set engines of war against thy walls and with his axes he shall break down thy towers 2610 by reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen and of the wheels and of the chariots when he shall enter into thy gates as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach 2611 with the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all thy streets he shall slay thy people by the sword and thy strong garrisons shall go down to the ground 2612 and they shall make a spoil of thy riches and make a prey of thy merchandise and they shall break down thy walls and destroy thy pleasant houses and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the water 2613 and i will cause the noise of thy songs to cease and the sound of thy harps shall be no more heard 2614 and i will make thee like the top of a rock thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon thou shalt be built no more for i the lord have spoken it saith the lord god 2615 thus saith the lord god to tyrus shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall when the wounded cry when the slaughter is made in the midst of thee 2616 then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones and lay away their robes and put off their broidered garments they shall clothe themselves with trembling they shall sit upon the ground and shall tremble at every moment and be astonished at thee 2617 and they shall take up a lamentation for thee and say to thee how art thou destroyed that wast inhabited of seafaring men the renowned city which wast strong in the sea she and her inhabitants which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it 2618 now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall yea the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at thy departure 2619 for thus saith the lord god when i shall make thee a desolate city like the cities that are not inhabited when i shall bring up the deep upon thee and great waters shall cover thee 2620 when i shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit with the people of old time and shall set thee in the low parts of the earth in places desolate of old with them that go down to the pit that thou be not inhabited and i shall set glory in the land of the living 2621 i will make thee a terror and thou shalt be no more though thou be sought for yet shalt thou never be found again saith the lord god 271 the word of the lord came again unto me saying 272 now thou son of man take up a lamentation for tyrus 273 and say unto tyrus o thou that art situate at the entry of the sea which art a merchant of the people for many isles thus saith the lord god o tyrus thou hast said i am of perfect beauty 274 thy borders are in the midst of the seas thy builders have perfected thy beauty 275 they have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of senir they have taken cedars from lebanon to make masts for thee 276 of the oaks of bashan have they made thine oars the company of the ashurites have made thy benches of ivory brought out of the isles of chittim 277 fine linen with broidered work from egypt was that which thou spreadest forth to be thy sail blue and purple from the isles of elishah was that which covered thee 278 the inhabitants of zidon and arvad were thy mariners thy wise men o tyrus that were in thee were thy pilots 279 the ancients of gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee thy calkers all the ships of the sea with their mariners were in thee to occupy thy merchandise 2710 they of persia and of lud and of phut were in thine army thy men of war they hanged the shield and helmet in thee they set forth thy comeliness 2711 the men of arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about and the gammadims were in thy towers they hanged their shields upon thy walls round about they have made thy beauty perfect 2712 tarshish was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches with silver iron tin and lead they traded in thy fairs 2713 javan tubal and meshech they were thy merchants they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in thy market 2714 they of the house of togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules 2715 the men of dedan were thy merchants many isles were the merchandise of thine hand they brought thee for a present horns of ivory and ebony 2716 syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making they occupied in thy fairs with emeralds purple and broidered work and fine linen and coral and agate 2717 judah and the land of israel they were thy merchants they traded in thy market wheat of minnith and pannag and honey and oil and balm 2718 damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making for the multitude of all riches in the wine of helbon and white wool 2719 dan also and javan going to and fro occupied in thy fairs bright iron cassia and calamus were in thy market 2720 dedan was thy merchant in precious clothes for chariots 2721 arabia and all the princes of kedar they occupied with thee in lambs and rams and goats in these were they thy merchants 2722 the merchants of sheba and raamah they were thy merchants they occupied in thy fairs with chief of all spices and with all precious stones and gold 2723 haran and canneh and eden the merchants of sheba asshur and chilmad were thy merchants 2724 these were thy merchants in all sorts of things in blue clothes and broidered work and in chests of rich apparel bound with cords and made of cedar among thy merchandise 2725 the ships of tarshish did sing of thee in thy market and thou wast replenished and made very glorious in the midst of the seas 2726 thy rowers have brought thee into great waters the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas 2727 thy riches and thy fairs thy merchandise thy mariners and thy pilots thy calkers and the occupiers of thy merchandise and all thy men of war that are in thee and in all thy company which is in the midst of thee shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin 2728 the suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots 2729 and all that handle the oar the mariners and all the pilots of the sea shall come down from their ships they shall stand upon the land 2730 and shall cause their voice to be heard against thee and shall cry bitterly and shall cast up dust upon their heads they shall wallow themselves in the ashes 2731 and they shall make themselves utterly bald for thee and gird them with sackcloth and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of heart and bitter wailing 2732 and in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee and lament over thee saying what city is like tyrus like the destroyed in the midst of the sea 2733 when thy wares went forth out of the seas thou filledst many people thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy merchandise 2734 in the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy merchandise and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall 2735 all the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee and their kings shall be sore afraid they shall be troubled in their countenance 2736 the merchants among the people shall hiss at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt be any more 281 the word of the lord came again unto me saying 282 son of man say unto the prince of tyrus thus saith the lord god because thine heart is lifted up and thou hast said i am a god i sit in the seat of god in the midst of the seas yet thou art a man and not god though thou set thine heart as the heart of god 283 behold thou art wiser than daniel there is no secret that they can hide from thee 284 with thy wisdom and with thine understanding thou hast gotten thee riches and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures 285 by thy great wisdom and by thy traffick hast thou increased thy riches and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches 286 therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of god 287 behold therefore i will bring strangers upon thee the terrible of the nations and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom and they shall defile thy brightness 288 they shall bring thee down to the pit and thou shalt die the deaths of them that are slain in the midst of the seas 289 wilt thou yet say before him that slayeth thee i am god but thou shalt be a man and no god in the hand of him that slayeth thee 2810 thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers for i have spoken it saith the lord god 2811 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying 2812 son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyrus and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou sealest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty 2813 thou hast been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering the sardius topaz and the diamond the beryl the onyx and the jasper the sapphire the emerald and the carbuncle and gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created 2814 thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so thou wast upon the holy mountain of god thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire 2815 thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created till iniquity was found in thee 2816 by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou hast sinned therefore i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i will destroy thee o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire 2817 thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast thee to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee 2818 thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffick therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee 2819 all they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be any more 2820 again the word of the lord came unto me saying 2821 son of man set thy face against zidon and prophesy against it 2822 and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o zidon and i will be glorified in the midst of thee and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall have executed judgments in her and shall be sanctified in her 2823 for i will send into her pestilence and blood into her streets and the wounded shall be judged in the midst of her by the sword upon her on every side and they shall know that i am the lord 2824 and there shall be no more a pricking brier unto the house of israel nor any grieving thorn of all that are round about them that despised them and they shall know that i am the lord god 2825 thus saith the lord god when i shall have gathered the house of israel from the people among whom they are scattered and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen then shall they dwell in their land that i have given to my servant jacob 2826 and they shall dwell safely therein and shall build houses and plant vineyards yea they shall dwell with confidence when i have executed judgments upon all those that despise them round about them and they shall know that i am the lord their god 291 in the tenth year in the tenth month in the twelfth day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying 292 son of man set thy face against pharaoh king of egypt and prophesy against him and against all egypt 293 speak and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee pharaoh king of egypt the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers which hath said my river is mine own and i have made it for myself 294 but i will put hooks in thy jaws and i will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales and i will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers and all the fish of thy rivers shall stick unto thy scales 295 and i will leave thee thrown into the wilderness thee and all the fish of thy rivers thou shalt fall upon the open fields thou shalt not be brought together nor gathered i have given thee for meat to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven 296 and all the inhabitants of egypt shall know that i am the lord because they have been a staff of reed to the house of israel 297 when they took hold of thee by thy hand thou didst break and rend all their shoulder and when they leaned upon thee thou brakest and madest all their loins to be at a stand 298 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will bring a sword upon thee and cut off man and beast out of thee 299 and the land of egypt shall be desolate and waste and they shall know that i am the lord because he hath said the river is mine and i have made it 2910 behold therefore i am against thee and against thy rivers and i will make the land of egypt utterly waste and desolate from the tower of syene even unto the border of ethiopia 2911 no foot of man shall pass through it nor foot of beast shall pass through it neither shall it be inhabited forty years 2912 and i will make the land of egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries 2913 yet thus saith the lord god at the end of forty years will i gather the egyptians from the people whither they were scattered 2914 and i will bring again the captivity of egypt and will cause them to return into the land of pathros into the land of their habitation and they shall be there a base kingdom 2915 it shall be the basest of the kingdoms neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations for i will diminish them that they shall no more rule over the nations 2916 and it shall be no more the confidence of the house of israel which bringeth their iniquity to remembrance when they shall look after them but they shall know that i am the lord god 2917 and it came to pass in the seven and twentieth year in the first month in the first day of the month the word of the lord came unto me saying 2918 son of man nebuchadrezzar king of babylon caused his army to serve a great service against tyrus every head was made bald and every shoulder was peeled yet had he no wages nor his army for tyrus for the service that he had served against it 2919 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i will give the land of egypt unto nebuchadrezzar king of babylon and he shall take her multitude and take her spoil and take her prey and it shall be the wages for his army 2920 i have given him the land of egypt for his labour wherewith he served against it because they wrought for me saith the lord god 2921 in that day will i cause the horn of the house of israel to bud forth and i will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them and they shall know that i am the lord 301 the word of the lord came again unto me saying 302 son of man prophesy and say thus saith the lord god howl ye woe worth the day 303 for the day is near even the day of the lord is near a cloudy day it shall be the time of the heathen 304 and the sword shall come upon egypt and great pain shall be in ethiopia when the slain shall fall in egypt and they shall take away her multitude and her foundations shall be broken down 305 ethiopia and libya and lydia and all the mingled people and chub and the men of the land that is in league shall fall with them by the sword 306 thus saith the lord they also that uphold egypt shall fall and the pride of her power shall come down from the tower of syene shall they fall in it by the sword saith the lord god 307 and they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted 308 and they shall know that i am the lord when i have set a fire in egypt and when all her helpers shall be destroyed 309 in that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless ethiopians afraid and great pain shall come upon them as in the day of egypt for lo it cometh 3010 thus saith the lord god i will also make the multitude of egypt to cease by the hand of nebuchadrezzar king of babylon 3011 he and his people with him the terrible of the nations shall be brought to destroy the land and they shall draw their swords against egypt and fill the land with the slain 3012 and i will make the rivers dry and sell the land into the hand of the wicked and i will make the land waste and all that is therein by the hand of strangers i the lord have spoken it 3013 thus saith the lord god i will also destroy the idols and i will cause their images to cease out of noph and there shall be no more a prince of the land of egypt and i will put a fear in the land of egypt 3014 and i will make pathros desolate and will set fire in zoan and will execute judgments in no 3015 and i will pour my fury upon sin the strength of egypt and i will cut off the multitude of no 3016 and i will set fire in egypt sin shall have great pain and no shall be rent asunder and noph shall have distresses daily 3017 the young men of aven and of pibeseth shall fall by the sword and these cities shall go into captivity 3018 at tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened when i shall break there the yokes of egypt and the pomp of her strength shall cease in her as for her a cloud shall cover her and her daughters shall go into captivity 3019 thus will i execute judgments in egypt and they shall know that i am the lord 3020 and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the first month in the seventh day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying 3021 son of man i have broken the arm of pharaoh king of egypt and lo it shall not be bound up to be healed to put a roller to bind it to make it strong to hold the sword 3022 therefore thus saith the lord god behold i am against pharaoh king of egypt and will break his arms the strong and that which was broken and i will cause the sword to fall out of his hand 3023 and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries 3024 and i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and put my sword in his hand but i will break pharaohs arms and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a deadly wounded man 3025 but i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and the arms of pharaoh shall fall down and they shall know that i am the lord when i shall put my sword into the hand of the king of babylon and he shall stretch it out upon the land of egypt 3026 and i will scatter the egyptians among the nations and disperse them among the countries and they shall know that i am the lord 311 and it came to pass in the eleventh year in the third month in the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying 312 son of man speak unto pharaoh king of egypt and to his multitude whom art thou like in thy greatness 313 behold the assyrian was a cedar in lebanon with fair branches and with a shadowing shroud and of an high stature and his top was among the thick boughs 314 the waters made him great the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants and sent her little rivers unto all the trees of the field 315 therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field and his boughs were multiplied and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters when he shot forth 316 all the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young and under his shadow dwelt all great nations 317 thus was he fair in his greatness in the length of his branches for his root was by great waters 318 the cedars in the garden of god could not hide him the fir trees were not like his boughs and the chestnut trees were not like his branches nor any tree in the garden of god was like unto him in his beauty 319 i have made him fair by the multitude of his branches so that all the trees of eden that were in the garden of god envied him 3110 therefore thus saith the lord god because thou hast lifted up thyself in height and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs and his heart is lifted up in his height 3111 i have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen he shall surely deal with him i have driven him out for his wickedness 3112 and strangers the terrible of the nations have cut him off and have left him upon the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow and have left him 3113 upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches 3114 to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs neither their trees stand up in their height all that drink water for they are all delivered unto death to the nether parts of the earth in the midst of the children of men with them that go down to the pit 3115 thus saith the lord god in the day when he went down to the grave i caused a mourning i covered the deep for him and i restrained the floods thereof and the great waters were stayed and i caused lebanon to mourn for him and all the trees of the field fainted for him 3116 i made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall when i cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit and all the trees of eden the choice and best of lebanon all that drink water shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth 3117 they also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain with the sword and they that were his arm that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the heathen 3118 to whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of eden yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of eden unto the nether parts of the earth thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword this is pharaoh and all his multitude saith the lord god 321 and it came to pass in the twelfth year in the twelfth month in the first day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying 322 son of man take up a lamentation for pharaoh king of egypt and say unto him thou art like a young lion of the nations and thou art as a whale in the seas and thou camest forth with thy rivers and troubledst the waters with thy feet and fouledst their rivers 323 thus saith the lord god i will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many people and they shall bring thee up in my net 324 then will i leave thee upon the land i will cast thee forth upon the open field and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee and i will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee 325 and i will lay thy flesh upon the mountains and fill the valleys with thy height 326 i will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest even to the mountains and the rivers shall be full of thee 327 and when i shall put thee out i will cover the heaven and make the stars thereof dark i will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon shall not give her light 328 all the bright lights of heaven will i make dark over thee and set darkness upon thy land saith the lord god 329 i will also vex the hearts of many people when i shall bring thy destruction among the nations into the countries which thou hast not known 3210 yea i will make many people amazed at thee and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee when i shall brandish my sword before them and they shall tremble at every moment every man for his own life in the day of thy fall 3211 for thus saith the lord god the sword of the king of babylon shall come upon thee 3212 by the swords of the mighty will i cause thy multitude to fall the terrible of the nations all of them and they shall spoil the pomp of egypt and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed 3213 i will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the great waters neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them 3214 then will i make their waters deep and cause their rivers to run like oil saith the lord god 3215 when i shall make the land of egypt desolate and the country shall be destitute of that whereof it was full when i shall smite all them that dwell therein then shall they know that i am the lord 3216 this is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her the daughters of the nations shall lament her they shall lament for her even for egypt and for all her multitude saith the lord god 3217 it came to pass also in the twelfth year in the fifteenth day of the month that the word of the lord came unto me saying 3218 son of man wail for the multitude of egypt and cast them down even her and the daughters of the famous nations unto the nether parts of the earth with them that go down into the pit 3219 whom dost thou pass in beauty go down and be thou laid with the uncircumcised 3220 they shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the sword she is delivered to the sword draw her and all her multitudes 3221 the strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of hell with them that help him they are gone down they lie uncircumcised slain by the sword 3222 asshur is there and all her company his graves are about him all of them slain fallen by the sword 3223 whose graves are set in the sides of the pit and her company is round about her grave all of them slain fallen by the sword which caused terror in the land of the living 3224 there is elam and all her multitude round about her grave all of them slain fallen by the sword which are gone down uncircumcised into the nether parts of the earth which caused their terror in the land of the living yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit 3225 they have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude her graves are round about him all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword though their terror was caused in the land of the living yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the pit he is put in the midst of them that be slain 3226 there is meshech tubal and all her multitude her graves are round about him all of them uncircumcised slain by the sword though they caused their terror in the land of the living 3227 and they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war and they have laid their swords under their heads but their iniquities shall be upon their bones though they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living 3228 yea thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword 3229 there is edom her kings and all her princes which with their might are laid by them that were slain by the sword they shall lie with the uncircumcised and with them that go down to the pit 3230 there be the princes of the north all of them and all the zidonians which are gone down with the slain with their terror they are ashamed of their might and they lie uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword and bear their shame with them that go down to the pit 3231 pharaoh shall see them and shall be comforted over all his multitude even pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword saith the lord god 3232 for i have caused my terror in the land of the living and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain with the sword even pharaoh and all his multitude saith the lord god 331 again the word of the lord came unto me saying 332 son of man speak to the children of thy people and say unto them when i bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of their coasts and set him for their watchman 333 if when he seeth the sword come upon the land he blow the trumpet and warn the people 334 then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head 335 he heard the sound of the trumpet and took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul 336 but if the watchman see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his iniquity but his blood will i require at the watchmans hand 337 so thou o son of man i have set thee a watchman unto the house of israel therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn them from me 338 when i say unto the wicked o wicked man thou shalt surely die if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way that wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will i require at thine hand 339 nevertheless if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it if he do not turn from his way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul 3310 therefore o thou son of man speak unto the house of israel thus ye speak saying if our transgressions and our sins be upon us and we pine away in them how should we then live 3311 say unto them as i live saith the lord god i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn ye turn ye from your evil ways for why will ye die o house of israel 3312 therefore thou son of man say unto the children of thy people the righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day of his transgression as for the wickedness of the wicked he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedness neither shall the righteous be able to live for his righteousness in the day that he sinneth 3313 when i shall say to the righteous that he shall surely live if he trust to his own righteousness and commit iniquity all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered but for his iniquity that he hath committed he shall die for it 3314 again when i say unto the wicked thou shalt surely die if he turn from his sin and do that which is lawful and right 3315 if the wicked restore the pledge give again that he had robbed walk in the statutes of life without committing iniquity he shall surely live he shall not die 3316 none of his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned unto him he hath done that which is lawful and right he shall surely live 3317 yet the children of thy people say the way of the lord is not equal but as for them their way is not equal 3318 when the righteous turneth from his righteousness and committeth iniquity he shall even die thereby 3319 but if the wicked turn from his wickedness and do that which is lawful and right he shall live thereby 3320 yet ye say the way of the lord is not equal o ye house of israel i will judge you every one after his ways 3321 and it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity in the tenth month in the fifth day of the month that one that had escaped out of jerusalem came unto me saying the city is smitten 3322 now the hand of the lord was upon me in the evening afore he that was escaped came and had opened my mouth until he came to me in the morning and my mouth was opened and i was no more dumb 3323 then the word of the lord came unto me saying 3324 son of man they that inhabit those wastes of the land of israel speak saying abraham was one and he inherited the land but we are many the land is given us for inheritance 3325 wherefore say unto them thus saith the lord god ye eat with the blood and lift up your eyes toward your idols and shed blood and shall ye possess the land 3326 ye stand upon your sword ye work abomination and ye defile every one his neighbours wife and shall ye possess the land 3327 say thou thus unto them thus saith the lord god as i live surely they that are in the wastes shall fall by the sword and him that is in the open field will i give to the beasts to be devoured and they that be in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence 3328 for i will lay the land most desolate and the pomp of her strength shall cease and the mountains of israel shall be desolate that none shall pass through 3329 then shall they know that i am the lord when i have laid the land most desolate because of all their abominations which they have committed 3330 also thou son of man the children of thy people still are talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses and speak one to another every one to his brother saying come i pray you and hear what is the word that cometh forth from the lord 3331 and they come unto thee as the people cometh and they sit before thee as my people and they hear thy words but they will not do them for with their mouth they shew much love but their heart goeth after their covetousness 3332 and lo thou art unto them as a very lovely song of one that hath a pleasant voice and can play well on an instrument for they hear thy words but they do them not 3333 and when this cometh to pass lo it will come then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them 341 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 342 son of man prophesy against the shepherds of israel prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god unto the shepherds woe be to the shepherds of israel that do feed themselves should not the shepherds feed the flocks 343 ye eat the fat and ye clothe you with the wool ye kill them that are fed but ye feed not the flock 344 the diseased have ye not strengthened neither have ye healed that which was sick neither have ye bound up that which was broken neither have ye brought again that which was driven away neither have ye sought that which was lost but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them 345 and they were scattered because there is no shepherd and they became meat to all the beasts of the field when they were scattered 346 my sheep wandered through all the mountains and upon every high hill yea my flock was scattered upon all the face of the earth and none did search or seek after them 347 therefore ye shepherds hear the word of the lord 348 as i live saith the lord god surely because my flock became a prey and my flock became meat to every beast of the field because there was no shepherd neither did my shepherds search for my flock but the shepherds fed themselves and fed not my flock 349 therefore o ye shepherds hear the word of the lord 3410 thus saith the lord god behold i am against the shepherds and i will require my flock at their hand and cause them to cease from feeding the flock neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more for i will deliver my flock from their mouth that they may not be meat for them 3411 for thus saith the lord god behold i even i will both search my sheep and seek them out 3412 as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will i seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day 3413 and i will bring them out from the people and gather them from the countries and will bring them to their own land and feed them upon the mountains of israel by the rivers and in all the inhabited places of the country 3414 i will feed them in a good pasture and upon the high mountains of israel shall their fold be there shall they lie in a good fold and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of israel 3415 i will feed my flock and i will cause them to lie down saith the lord god 3416 i will seek that which was lost and bring again that which was driven away and will bind up that which was broken and will strengthen that which was sick but i will destroy the fat and the strong i will feed them with judgment 3417 and as for you o my flock thus saith the lord god behold i judge between cattle and cattle between the rams and the he goats 3418 seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures and to have drunk of the deep waters but ye must foul the residue with your feet 3419 and as for my flock they eat that which ye have trodden with your feet and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet 3420 therefore thus saith the lord god unto them behold i even i will judge between the fat cattle and between the lean cattle 3421 because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder and pushed all the diseased with your horns till ye have scattered them abroad 3422 therefore will i save my flock and they shall no more be a prey and i will judge between cattle and cattle 3423 and i will set up one shepherd over them and he shall feed them even my servant david he shall feed them and he shall be their shepherd 3424 and i the lord will be their god and my servant david a prince among them i the lord have spoken it 3425 and i will make with them a covenant of peace and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods 3426 and i will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing and i will cause the shower to come down in his season there shall be showers of blessing 3427 and the tree of the field shall yield her fruit and the earth shall yield her increase and they shall be safe in their land and shall know that i am the lord when i have broken the bands of their yoke and delivered them out of the hand of those that served themselves of them 3428 and they shall no more be a prey to the heathen neither shall the beast of the land devour them but they shall dwell safely and none shall make them afraid 3429 and i will raise up for them a plant of renown and they shall be no more consumed with hunger in the land neither bear the shame of the heathen any more 3430 thus shall they know that i the lord their god am with them and that they even the house of israel are my people saith the lord god 3431 and ye my flock the flock of my pasture are men and i am your god saith the lord god 351 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying 352 son of man set thy face against mount seir and prophesy against it 353 and say unto it thus saith the lord god behold o mount seir i am against thee and i will stretch out mine hand against thee and i will make thee most desolate 354 i will lay thy cities waste and thou shalt be desolate and thou shalt know that i am the lord 355 because thou hast had a perpetual hatred and hast shed the blood of the children of israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity in the time that their iniquity had an end 356 therefore as i live saith the lord god i will prepare thee unto blood and blood shall pursue thee sith thou hast not hated blood even blood shall pursue thee 357 thus will i make mount seir most desolate and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth 358 and i will fill his mountains with his slain men in thy hills and in thy valleys and in all thy rivers shall they fall that are slain with the sword 359 i will make thee perpetual desolations and thy cities shall not return and ye shall know that i am the lord 3510 because thou hast said these two nations and these two countries shall be mine and we will possess it whereas the lord was there 3511 therefore as i live saith the lord god i will even do according to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them and i will make myself known among them when i have judged thee 3512 and thou shalt know that i am the lord and that i have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of israel saying they are laid desolate they are given us to consume 3513 thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me and have multiplied your words against me i have heard them 3514 thus saith the lord god when the whole earth rejoiceth i will make thee desolate 3515 as thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of israel because it was desolate so will i do unto thee thou shalt be desolate o mount seir and all idumea even all of it and they shall know that i am the lord 361 also thou son of man prophesy unto the mountains of israel and say ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord 362 thus saith the lord god because the enemy hath said against you aha even the ancient high places are ours in possession 363 therefore prophesy and say thus saith the lord god because they have made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers and are an infamy of the people 364 therefore ye mountains of israel hear the word of the lord god thus saith the lord god to the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken which became a prey and derision to the residue of the heathen that are round about 365 therefore thus saith the lord god surely in the fire of my jealousy have i spoken against the residue of the heathen and against all idumea which have appointed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart with despiteful minds to cast it out for a prey 366 prophesy therefore concerning the land of israel and say unto the mountains and to the hills to the rivers and to the valleys thus saith the lord god behold i have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury because ye have borne the shame of the heathen 367 therefore thus saith the lord god i have lifted up mine hand surely the heathen that are about you they shall bear their shame 368 but ye o mountains of israel ye shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people of israel for they are at hand to come 369 for behold i am for you and i will turn unto you and ye shall be tilled and sown 3610 and i will multiply men upon you all the house of israel even all of it and the cities shall be inhabited and the wastes shall be builded 3611 and i will multiply upon you man and beast and they shall increase and bring fruit and i will settle you after your old estates and will do better unto you than at your beginnings and ye shall know that i am the lord 3612 yea i will cause men to walk upon you even my people israel and they shall possess thee and thou shalt be their inheritance and thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men 3613 thus saith the lord god because they say unto you thou land devourest up men and hast bereaved thy nations 3614 therefore thou shalt devour men no more neither bereave thy nations any more saith the lord god 3615 neither will i cause men to hear in thee the shame of the heathen any more neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any more neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more saith the lord god 3616 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying 3617 son of man when the house of israel dwelt in their own land they defiled it by their own way and by their doings their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman 3618 wherefore i poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it 3619 and i scattered them among the heathen and they were dispersed through the countries according to their way and according to their doings i judged them 3620 and when they entered unto the heathen whither they went they profaned my holy name when they said to them these are the people of the lord and are gone forth out of his land 3621 but i had pity for mine holy name which the house of israel had profaned among the heathen whither they went 3622 therefore say unto the house of israel thus saith the lord god i do not this for your sakes o house of israel but for mine holy names sake which ye have profaned among the heathen whither ye went 3623 and i will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathen which ye have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes 3624 for i will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land 3625 then will i sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols will i cleanse you 3626 a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you an heart of flesh 3627 and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them 3628 and ye shall dwell in the land that i gave to your fathers and ye shall be my people and i will be your god 3629 i will also save you from all your uncleannesses and i will call for the corn and will increase it and lay no famine upon you 3630 and i will multiply the fruit of the tree and the increase of the field that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the heathen 3631 then shall ye remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations 3632 not for your sakes do i this saith the lord god be it known unto you be ashamed and confounded for your own ways o house of israel 3633 thus saith the lord god in the day that i shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities i will also cause you to dwell in the cities and the wastes shall be builded 3634 and the desolate land shall be tilled whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by 3635 and they shall say this land that was desolate is become like the garden of eden and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are become fenced and are inhabited 3636 then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that i the lord build the ruined places and plant that that was desolate i the lord have spoken it and i will do it 3637 thus saith the lord god i will yet for this be enquired of by the house of israel to do it for them i will increase them with men like a flock 3638 as the holy flock as the flock of jerusalem in her solemn feasts so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men and they shall know that i am the lord 371 the hand of the lord was upon me and carried me out in the spirit of the lord and set me down in the midst of the valley which was full of bones 372 and caused me to pass by them round about and behold there were very many in the open valley and lo they were very dry 373 and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and i answered o lord god thou knowest 374 again he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them o ye dry bones hear the word of the lord 375 thus saith the lord god unto these bones behold i will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live 376 and i will lay sinews upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall live and ye shall know that i am the lord 377 so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i prophesied there was a noise and behold a shaking and the bones came together bone to his bone 378 and when i beheld lo the sinews and the flesh came up upon them and the skin covered them above but there was no breath in them 379 then said he unto me prophesy unto the wind prophesy son of man and say to the wind thus saith the lord god come from the four winds o breath and breathe upon these slain that they may live 3710 so i prophesied as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army 3711 then he said unto me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel behold they say our bones are dried and our hope is lost we are cut off for our parts 3712 therefore prophesy and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold o my people i will open your graves and cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of israel 3713 and ye shall know that i am the lord when i have opened your graves o my people and brought you up out of your graves 3714 and shall put my spirit in you and ye shall live and i shall place you in your own land then shall ye know that i the lord have spoken it and performed it saith the lord 3715 the word of the lord came again unto me saying 3716 moreover thou son of man take thee one stick and write upon it for judah and for the children of israel his companions then take another stick and write upon it for joseph the stick of ephraim and for all the house of israel his companions 3717 and join them one to another into one stick and they shall become one in thine hand 3718 and when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee saying wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these 3719 say unto them thus saith the lord god behold i will take the stick of joseph which is in the hand of ephraim and the tribes of israel his fellows and will put them with him even with the stick of judah and make them one stick and they shall be one in mine hand 3720 and the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand before their eyes 3721 and say unto them thus saith the lord god behold i will take the children of israel from among the heathen whither they be gone and will gather them on every side and bring them into their own land 3722 and i will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains of israel and one king shall be king to them all and they shall be no more two nations neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all 3723 neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols nor with their detestable things nor with any of their transgressions but i will save them out of all their dwellingplaces wherein they have sinned and will cleanse them so shall they be my people and i will be their god 3724 and david my servant shall be king over them and they all shall have one shepherd they shall also walk in my judgments and observe my statutes and do them 3725 and they shall dwell in the land that i have given unto jacob my servant wherein your fathers have dwelt and they shall dwell therein even they and their children and their childrens children for ever and my servant david shall be their prince for ever 3726 moreover i will make a covenant of peace with them it shall be an everlasting covenant with them and i will place them and multiply them and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore 3727 my tabernacle also shall be with them yea i will be their god and they shall be my people 3728 and the heathen shall know that i the lord do sanctify israel when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore 381 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 382 son of man set thy face against gog the land of magog the chief prince of meshech and tubal and prophesy against him 383 and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o gog the chief prince of meshech and tubal 384 and i will turn thee back and put hooks into thy jaws and i will bring thee forth and all thine army horses and horsemen all of them clothed with all sorts of armour even a great company with bucklers and shields all of them handling swords 385 persia ethiopia and libya with them all of them with shield and helmet 386 gomer and all his bands the house of togarmah of the north quarters and all his bands and many people with thee 387 be thou prepared and prepare for thyself thou and all thy company that are assembled unto thee and be thou a guard unto them 388 after many days thou shalt be visited in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword and is gathered out of many people against the mountains of israel which have been always waste but it is brought forth out of the nations and they shall dwell safely all of them 389 thou shalt ascend and come like a storm thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land thou and all thy bands and many people with thee 3810 thus saith the lord god it shall also come to pass that at the same time shall things come into thy mind and thou shalt think an evil thought 3811 and thou shalt say i will go up to the land of unwalled villages i will go to them that are at rest that dwell safely all of them dwelling without walls and having neither bars nor gates 3812 to take a spoil and to take a prey to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations which have gotten cattle and goods that dwell in the midst of the land 3813 sheba and dedan and the merchants of tarshish with all the young lions thereof shall say unto thee art thou come to take a spoil hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey to carry away silver and gold to take away cattle and goods to take a great spoil 3814 therefore son of man prophesy and say unto gog thus saith the lord god in that day when my people of israel dwelleth safely shalt thou not know it 3815 and thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts thou and many people with thee all of them riding upon horses a great company and a mighty army 3816 and thou shalt come up against my people of israel as a cloud to cover the land it shall be in the latter days and i will bring thee against my land that the heathen may know me when i shall be sanctified in thee o gog before their eyes 3817 thus saith the lord god art thou he of whom i have spoken in old time by my servants the prophets of israel which prophesied in those days many years that i would bring thee against them 3818 and it shall come to pass at the same time when gog shall come against the land of israel saith the lord god that my fury shall come up in my face 3819 for in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have i spoken surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of israel 3820 so that the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the field and all creeping things that creep upon the earth and all the men that are upon the face of the earth shall shake at my presence and the mountains shall be thrown down and the steep places shall fall and every wall shall fall to the ground 3821 and i will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains saith the lord god every mans sword shall be against his brother 3822 and i will plead against him with pestilence and with blood and i will rain upon him and upon his bands and upon the many people that are with him an overflowing rain and great hailstones fire and brimstone 3823 thus will i magnify myself and sanctify myself and i will be known in the eyes of many nations and they shall know that i am the lord 391 therefore thou son of man prophesy against gog and say thus saith the lord god behold i am against thee o gog the chief prince of meshech and tubal 392 and i will turn thee back and leave but the sixth part of thee and will cause thee to come up from the north parts and will bring thee upon the mountains of israel 393 and i will smite thy bow out of thy left hand and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand 394 thou shalt fall upon the mountains of israel thou and all thy bands and the people that is with thee i will give thee unto the ravenous birds of every sort and to the beasts of the field to be devoured 395 thou shalt fall upon the open field for i have spoken it saith the lord god 396 and i will send a fire on magog and among them that dwell carelessly in the isles and they shall know that i am the lord 397 so will i make my holy name known in the midst of my people israel and i will not let them pollute my holy name any more and the heathen shall know that i am the lord the holy one in israel 398 behold it is come and it is done saith the lord god this is the day whereof i have spoken 399 and they that dwell in the cities of israel shall go forth and shall set on fire and burn the weapons both the shields and the bucklers the bows and the arrows and the handstaves and the spears and they shall burn them with fire seven years 3910 so that they shall take no wood out of the field neither cut down any out of the forests for they shall burn the weapons with fire and they shall spoil those that spoiled them and rob those that robbed them saith the lord god 3911 and it shall come to pass in that day that i will give unto gog a place there of graves in israel the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea and it shall stop the noses of the passengers and there shall they bury gog and all his multitude and they shall call it the valley of hamongog 3912 and seven months shall the house of israel be burying of them that they may cleanse the land 3913 yea all the people of the land shall bury them and it shall be to them a renown the day that i shall be glorified saith the lord god 3914 and they shall sever out men of continual employment passing through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the face of the earth to cleanse it after the end of seven months shall they search 3915 and the passengers that pass through the land when any seeth a mans bone then shall he set up a sign by it till the buriers have buried it in the valley of hamongog 3916 and also the name of the city shall be hamonah thus shall they cleanse the land 3917 and thou son of man thus saith the lord god speak unto every feathered fowl and to every beast of the field assemble yourselves and come gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that i do sacrifice for you even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of israel that ye may eat flesh and drink blood 3918 ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty and drink the blood of the princes of the earth of rams of lambs and of goats of bullocks all of them fatlings of bashan 3919 and ye shall eat fat till ye be full and drink blood till ye be drunken of my sacrifice which i have sacrificed for you 3920 thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots with mighty men and with all men of war saith the lord god 3921 and i will set my glory among the heathen and all the heathen shall see my judgment that i have executed and my hand that i have laid upon them 3922 so the house of israel shall know that i am the lord their god from that day and forward 3923 and the heathen shall know that the house of israel went into captivity for their iniquity because they trespassed against me therefore hid i my face from them and gave them into the hand of their enemies so fell they all by the sword 3924 according to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions have i done unto them and hid my face from them 3925 therefore thus saith the lord god now will i bring again the captivity of jacob and have mercy upon the whole house of israel and will be jealous for my holy name 3926 after that they have borne their shame and all their trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me when they dwelt safely in their land and none made

to the gate even the gate that looketh toward the east 432 and behold the glory of the god of israel came from the way of the east and his voice was like a noise of many waters and the earth shined with his glory 433 and it was according to the appearance of the vision which i saw even according to the vision that i saw when i came to destroy the city and the visions were like the vision that i saw by the river chebar and i fell upon my face 434 and the glory of the lord came into the house by the way of the gate whose prospect is toward the east 435 so the spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court and behold the glory of the lord filled the house 436 and i heard him speaking unto me out of the house and the man stood by me 437 and he said unto me son of man the place of my throne and the place of the soles of my feet where i will dwell in the midst of the children of israel for ever and my holy name shall the house of israel no more defile neither they nor their kings by their whoredom nor by the carcases of their kings in their high places 438 in their setting of their threshold by my thresholds and their post by my posts and the wall between me and them they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed wherefore i have consumed them in mine anger 439 now let them put away their whoredom and the carcases of their kings far from me and i will dwell in the midst of them for ever 4310 thou son of man shew the house to the house of israel that they may be ashamed of their iniquities and let them measure the pattern 4311 and if they be ashamed of all that they have done shew them the form of the house and the fashion thereof and the goings out thereof and the comings in thereof and all the forms thereof and all the ordinances thereof and all the forms thereof and all the laws thereof and write it in their sight that they may keep the whole form thereof and all the ordinances thereof and do them 4312 this is the

squares thereof 4317 and the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof and the border about it shall be half a cubit and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about and his stairs shall look toward the east 4318 and he said unto me son of man thus saith the lord god these are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it to offer burnt offerings thereon and to sprinkle blood thereon 4319 and thou shalt give to the priests the levites that be of the seed of zadok which approach unto me to minister unto me saith the lord god a young bullock for a sin offering 4320 and thou shalt take of the blood thereof and put it on the four horns of it and on the four corners of the settle and upon the border round about thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it 4321 thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering and he shall burn it in the appointed place of the house without the sanctuary 4322 and on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats without blemish for a sin offering and they shall cleanse the altar as they did cleanse it with the bullock 4323 when thou hast made an end of cleansing it thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish and a ram out of the flock without blemish 4324 and thou shalt offer them before the lord and the priests shall cast salt upon them and they shall offer them up for a burnt offering unto the lord 4325 seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin offering they shall also prepare a young bullock and a ram out of the flock without blemish 4326 seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it and they shall consecrate themselves 4327 and when these days are expired it shall be that upon the eighth day and so forward the priests shall make your burnt offerings upon the altar and your peace offerings and i will accept you saith the lord god 441 then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east and it was shut 442 then said the lord unto me this gate shall be shut it shall not be opened and no man shall enter in by it because the lord the god of israel hath entered in by it therefore it shall be shut 443 it is for the prince the prince he shall sit in it to eat bread before the lord he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate and shall go out by the way of the same 444 then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house and i looked and behold the glory of the lord filled the house of the lord and i fell upon my face 445 and the lord said unto me son of man mark well and behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears all that i say unto thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the lord and all the laws thereof and mark well the entering in of the house with every going forth of the sanctuary 446 and thou shalt say to the rebellious even to the house of israel thus saith the lord god o ye house of israel let it suffice you of all your abominations 447 in that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh to be in my sanctuary to pollute it even my house when ye offer my bread the fat and the blood and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations 448 and ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves 449 thus saith the lord god no stranger uncircumcised in heart nor uncircumcised in flesh shall enter into my sanctuary of any stranger that is among the children of israel 4410 and the levites that are gone away far from me when israel went astray which went astray away from me after their idols they shall even bear their iniquity 4411 yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary having charge at the gates of the house and ministering to the house they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people and they shall stand before them to minister unto them 4412 because they ministered unto them before their idols and caused the house of israel to fall into iniquity therefore have i lifted up mine hand against them saith the lord god and they shall bear their iniquity 4413 and they shall not come near unto me to do the office of a priest unto me nor to come near to any of my holy things in the most holy place but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed 4414 but i will make them keepers of the charge of the house for all the service thereof and for all that shall be done therein 4415 but the priests the levites the sons of zadok that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the children of israel went astray from me they shall come near to me to minister unto me and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood saith the lord god

neither shall they shave their heads nor suffer their locks to grow long they shall only poll their heads 4421 neither shall any priest drink wine when they enter into the inner court 4422 neither shall they take for their wives a widow nor her that is put away but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of israel or a widow that had a priest before 4423 and they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane and cause them to discern between the unclean and the clean 4424 and in controversy they shall stand in judgment and they shall judge it according to my judgments and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies and they shall hallow my sabbaths 4425 and they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves but for father or for mother or for son or for daughter for brother or for sister that hath had no husband they may defile themselves 4426 and after he is cleansed they shall reckon unto him seven days 4427 and in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary unto the inner court to minister in the sanctuary he shall offer his sin offering saith the lord god 4428 and it shall be unto them for an inheritance i am their inheritance and ye shall give them no possession in israel i am their possession 4429 they shall eat the meat offering and the sin offering and the trespass offering and every dedicated thing in israel shall be theirs 4430 and the first of all the firstfruits of all things and every oblation of all of every sort of your oblations shall be the priests ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house 4431 the priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself or torn whether it be fowl or beast 451 moreover when ye

most holy place 454 the holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary which shall come near to minister unto the lord and it shall be a place for their houses and an

corners of the settle of the altar and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court 4520 and so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every one that erreth and for him that is simple so shall ye reconcile the house 4521 in the first month in the fourteenth day of the month ye shall have the passover a feast of seven days unleavened bread shall be eaten 4522 and upon that day shall

to the meat offering and according to the oil 461 thus saith the lord god the gate of the inner court that looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days but on the sabbath it shall be opened and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened 462 and the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate without and shall stand by the post of the gate and the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate then he shall go forth but the gate shall not be shut until the evening 463 likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the lord in the sabbaths and in the new moons 464 and the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the lord in the sabbath day shall be

4614 and thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning the sixth part of an ephah and the third part of an hin of oil to temper with the fine flour a meat offering continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the lord 4615 thus shall they prepare the lamb and the meat offering and the oil every morning for a continual burnt offering 4616 thus saith the lord god if the prince give a gift unto any of his sons the inheritance thereof shall be his sons it shall be their possession by inheritance 4617 but if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants then it shall be his to the year of liberty after it shall return to the prince but his inheritance shall be his sons for them 4618 moreover the prince shall not take of the peoples inheritance by oppression to thrust them out of their possession but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession that my people be not scattered every man from his possession 4619 after he brought me through the entry which was at the side of the gate into the holy chambers of the priests which looked toward the north and behold there was a place on the two sides westward 4620 then said he unto me this is the place where the priests shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering where they shall bake the meat offering that they bear them not out into the utter court to sanctify the people 4621 then he brought me forth into the utter court and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court and behold in every corner of the court there was a court 4622 in the four corners of the court there were courts joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad these four corners were of one measure 4623 and there was a row of building round about in them round about them four and it was made with boiling places under the rows round about 4624 then said he unto me these are the places of them that boil where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people 471 afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house and behold waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward for the forefront of the house stood toward the east and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house at the south side of the altar 472 then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward and led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way that looketh eastward and behold there ran out waters on the right side 473 and when the man that had the line in his hand went forth eastward he measured a thousand cubits and he brought me through the waters the waters were to the ankles 474 again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters the waters were to the knees again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters were to the loins 475 afterward he measured a thousand and it was a river that i could not pass over for the waters were risen waters to swim in a river that could not be passed over 476 and he said unto me son of man hast thou seen this then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river 477 now when i had returned behold at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other 478 then said he unto me these waters issue out toward the east country and go down into the desert and go into the sea which being brought forth into the sea the waters shall be healed 479 and it shall come to pass that every thing that liveth which moveth whithersoever the rivers shall come shall live and there shall be a very great multitude of fish because these waters shall come thither for they shall be healed and every thing shall live whither the river cometh 4710 and it shall come to pass that the fishers shall stand upon it from engedi even unto eneglaim they shall be a place to spread forth nets their fish shall be according to their kinds as the fish of the great sea exceeding many 4711 but the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not be healed they shall be given to salt 4712 and by the river upon the bank thereof on this side and on that side shall grow all trees for meat whose leaf shall not fade neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed it shall bring forth new fruit according to his months because their waters they issued out of the sanctuary and the fruit thereof shall be for meat and the leaf thereof for medicine 4713 thus saith the lord god this shall be the border whereby ye shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of israel joseph shall have two portions 4714 and ye shall inherit it one as well as another concerning

about eighteen thousand measures and the name of the city from that day shall be the lord is there the book of daniel 11 in the third year of the reign of jehoiakim king of judah came nebuchadnezzar king of babylon unto jerusalem and besieged it 12 and the lord gave jehoiakim king of judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of god which he carried into the land of shinar to the house of his god and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god 13 and the king spake unto ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs that he should bring certain of the children of israel and of the kings seed and of the princes 14 children in whom was no blemish but well favoured and skilful in all wisdom and cunning in knowledge and understanding science and such as had ability in them to stand in the kings palace and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the chaldeans 15 and the king appointed them a daily provision of the kings meat and of the wine which he drank so nourishing them three years that at the end thereof they might stand before the king 16 now among these were of the children of judah daniel hananiah mishael and azariah 17 unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names for he gave unto daniel the name of belteshazzar and to hananiah of shadrach and to mishael of meshach and to azariah of abednego 18 but daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the kings meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself 19 now god had brought daniel into favour and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs 110 and the prince of the eunuchs said unto daniel i fear my lord the king who hath appointed your meat and your drink for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king 111 then said daniel to melzar whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over daniel hananiah mishael and azariah 112 prove thy servants i beseech thee ten days and let them give us pulse to eat and water to drink 113 then let our countenances be looked upon before thee and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the kings meat and as thou seest deal with thy servants 114 so he consented to them in this matter and proved them ten days 115 and at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the kings meat 116 thus melzar took away the portion of their meat and the wine that they should drink and gave them pulse 117 as for these four children god gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom and daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams 118 now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before nebuchadnezzar 119 and the king communed with them and among them all was found none like daniel hananiah mishael and azariah therefore stood they before the king 120 and in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king enquired of them he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm 121 and daniel continued even unto the first year of king cyrus 21 and in the second year of the reign of nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams wherewith his spirit was troubled and his sleep brake from him 22 then the king commanded to call the magicians and the astrologers and the sorcerers and the chaldeans for to shew the king his dreams so they came and stood before the king 23 and the king said unto them i have dreamed a dream and my spirit was troubled to know the dream 24 then spake the chaldeans to the king in syriack o king live for ever tell thy servants the dream and we will shew the interpretation 25 the king answered and said to the chaldeans the thing is gone from me if ye will not make known unto me the dream with the interpretation thereof ye shall be cut in pieces and your houses shall be made a dunghill 26 but if ye shew the dream and the interpretation thereof ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour therefore shew me the dream and the interpretation thereof 27 they answered again and said let the king tell his servants the dream and we will shew the interpretation of it 28 the king answered and said i know of certainty that ye would gain the time because ye see the thing is gone from me 29 but if ye will not make known unto me the dream there is but one decree for you for ye have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me till the time be changed therefore tell me the dream and i shall know that ye can shew me the interpretation thereof 210 the chaldeans answered before the king and said there is not a man upon the earth that can shew the kings matter therefore there is no king lord nor ruler that asked such things at any magician or astrologer or chaldean 211 and it is a rare thing that the king requireth and there is none other that can shew it before the king except the gods whose dwelling is not with flesh 212 for this cause the king was angry and very furious and commanded to destroy all the wise men of babylon 213 and the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain and they sought daniel and his fellows to be slain 214 then daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to arioch the captain of the kings guard which was gone forth to slay the wise men of babylon 215 he answered and said to arioch the kings captain why is the decree so hasty from the king then arioch made the thing known to daniel 216 then daniel went in and desired of the king that he would give him time and that he would shew the king the interpretation 217 then daniel went to his house and made the thing known to hananiah mishael and azariah his companions 218 that they would desire mercies of the god of heaven concerning this secret that daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of babylon 219 then was the secret revealed unto daniel in a night vision then daniel blessed the god of heaven 220 daniel answered and said blessed be the name of god for ever and ever for wisdom and might are his 221 and he changeth the times and the seasons he removeth kings and setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding 222 he revealeth the deep and secret things he knoweth what is in the darkness and the light dwelleth with him 223 i thank thee and praise thee o thou god of my fathers who hast given me wisdom and might and hast made known unto me now what we desired of thee for thou hast now made known unto us the kings matter 224 therefore daniel went in unto arioch whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of babylon he went and said thus unto him destroy not the wise men of babylon bring me in before the king and i will shew unto the king the interpretation 225 then arioch brought in daniel before the king in haste and said thus unto him i have found a man of the captives of judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation 226 the king answered and said to daniel whose name was belteshazzar art thou able to make known unto me the dream which i have seen and the interpretation thereof 227 daniel answered in the presence of the king and said the secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men the astrologers the magicians the soothsayers shew unto the king 228 but there is a god in heaven that revealeth secrets and maketh known to the king nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days thy dream and the visions of thy head upon thy bed are these 229 as for thee o king thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy bed what should come to pass hereafter and he that revealeth secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass 230 but as for me this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that i have more than any living but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king and that thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart 231 thou o king sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible 232 this images head was of fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass 233 his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay 234 thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and brake them to pieces 235 then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth 236 this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king 237 thou o king art a king of kings for the god of heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory 238 and wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and hath made thee ruler over them all thou art this head of gold 239 and after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth 240 and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breaketh all these shall it break in pieces and bruise 241 and whereas thou sawest the feet and toes part of potters clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron forasmuch as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay 242 and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken 243 and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay 244 and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand for ever 245 forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it brake in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure 246 then the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto him 247 the king answered unto daniel and said of a truth it is that your god is a god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer of secrets seeing thou couldest reveal this secret 248 then the king made daniel a great man and gave him many great gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of babylon and chief of the governors over all the wise men of babylon 249 then daniel requested of the king and he set shadrach meshach and abednego over the affairs of the province of babylon but daniel sat in the gate of the king 31 nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was threescore cubits and the breadth thereof six cubits he set it up in the plain of dura in the province of babylon 32 then nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors and the captains the judges the treasurers the counsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had set up 33 then the princes the governors and captains the judges the treasurers the counsellors the sheriffs and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up and they stood before the image that nebuchadnezzar had set up 34 then an herald cried aloud to you it is commanded o people nations and languages 35 that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery dulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up 36 and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace 37 therefore at that time when all the people heard the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and all kinds of musick all the people the nations and the languages fell down and worshipped the golden image that nebuchadnezzar the king had set up 38 wherefore at that time certain chaldeans came near and accused the jews 39 they spake and said to the king nebuchadnezzar o king live for ever 310 thou o king hast made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer and all kinds of musick shall fall down and worship the golden image 311 and whoso falleth not down and worshippeth that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace 312 there are certain jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of babylon shadrach meshach and abednego these men o king have not regarded thee they serve not thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up 313 then nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring shadrach meshach and abednego then they brought these men before the king 314 nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true o shadrach meshach and abednego do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which i have set up 315 now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet flute harp sackbut psaltery and dulcimer and all kinds of musick ye fall down and worship the image which i have made well but if ye worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands 316 shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter 317 if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand o king 318 but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up 319 then was nebuchadnezzar full of fury and the form of his visage was changed against shadrach meshach and abednego therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated 320 and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind shadrach meshach and abednego and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace 321 then these men were bound in their coats their hosen and their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace 322 therefore because the kings commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot the flames of the fire slew those men that took up shadrach meshach and abednego 323 and these three men shadrach meshach and abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace 324 then nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied and rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counsellors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire they answered and said unto the king true o king 325 he answered and said lo i see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the son of god 326 then nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said shadrach meshach and abednego ye servants of the most high god come forth and come hither then shadrach meshach and abednego came forth of the midst of the fire 327 and the princes governors and captains and the kings counsellors being gathered together saw these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power nor was an hair of their head singed neither were their coats changed nor the smell of fire had passed on them 328 then nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of shadrach meshach and abednego who hath sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the kings word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own god 329 therefore i make a decree that every people nation and language which speak any thing amiss against the god of shadrach meshach and abednego shall be cut in pieces and their houses shall be made a dunghill because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort 330 then the king promoted shadrach meshach and abednego in the province of babylon 41 nebuchadnezzar the king unto all people nations and languages that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you 42 i thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high god hath wrought toward me 43 how great are his signs and how mighty are his wonders his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his dominion is from generation to generation 44 i nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house and flourishing in my palace 45 i saw a dream which made me afraid and the thoughts upon my bed and the visions of my head troubled me 46 therefore made i a decree to bring in all the wise men of babylon before me that they might make known unto me the interpretation of the dream 47 then came in the magicians the astrologers the chaldeans and the soothsayers and i told the dream before them but they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof 48 but at the last daniel came in before me whose name was belteshazzar according to the name of my god and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and before him i told the dream saying 49 o belteshazzar master of the magicians because i know that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee and no secret troubleth thee tell me the visions of my dream that i have seen and the interpretation thereof 410 thus were the visions of mine head in my bed i saw and behold a tree in the midst of the earth and the height thereof was great 411 the tree grew and was strong and the height thereof reached unto heaven and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth 412 the leaves thereof were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it was meat for all the beasts of the field had shadow under it and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs thereof and all flesh was fed of it 413 i saw in the visions of my head upon my bed and behold a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven 414 he cried aloud and said thus hew down the tree and cut off his branches shake off his leaves and scatter his fruit let the beasts get away from under it and the fowls from his branches 415 nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth 416 let his heart be changed from mans and let a beasts heart be given unto him and let seven times pass over him 417 this matter is by the decree of the watchers and the demand by the word of the holy ones to the intent that the living may know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will and setteth up over it the basest of men 418 this dream i king nebuchadnezzar have seen now thou o belteshazzar declare the interpretation thereof forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto me the interpretation but thou art able for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee 419 then daniel whose name was belteshazzar was astonied for one hour and his thoughts troubled him the king spake and said belteshazzar let not the dream or the interpretation thereof trouble thee belteshazzar answered and said my lord the dream be to them that hate thee and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies 420 the tree that thou sawest which grew and was strong whose height reached unto the heaven and the sight thereof to all the earth 421 whose leaves were fair and the fruit thereof much and in it was meat for all under which the beasts of the field dwelt and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation 422 it is thou o king that art grown and become strong for thy greatness is grown and reacheth unto heaven and thy dominion to the end of the earth 423 and whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven and saying hew the tree down and destroy it yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth even with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the field and let it be wet with the dew of heaven and let his portion be with the beasts of the field till seven times pass over him 424 this is the interpretation o king and this is the decree of the most high which is come upon my lord the king 425 that they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field and they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven and seven times shall pass over thee till thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will 426 and whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee after that thou shalt have known that the heavens do rule 427 wherefore o king let my counsel be acceptable unto thee and break off thy sins by righteousness and thine iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor if it may be a lengthening of thy tranquillity 428 all this came upon the king nebuchadnezzar 429 at the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of babylon 430 the king spake and said is not this great babylon that i have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honour of my majesty 431 while the word was in the kings mouth there fell a voice from heaven saying o king nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee 432 and they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field they shall make thee to eat grass as oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most high ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will 433 the same hour was the thing fulfilled upon nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from men and did eat grass as oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hairs were grown like eagles feathers and his nails like birds claws 434 and at the end of the days i nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven and mine understanding returned unto me and i blessed the most high and i praised and honoured him that liveth for ever whose dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generation 435 and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou 436 at the same time my reason returned unto me and for the glory of my kingdom mine honour and brightness returned unto me and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me and i was established in my kingdom and excellent majesty was added unto me 437 now i nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the king of heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in pride he is able to abase 51 belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords and drank wine before the thousand 52 belshazzar whiles he tasted the wine commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple which was in jerusalem that the king and his princes his wives and his concubines might drink therein 53 then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of god which was at jerusalem and the king and his princes his wives and his concubines drank in them 54 they drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver of brass of iron of wood and of stone 55 in the same hour came forth fingers of a mans hand and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the kings palace and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote 56 then the kings countenance was changed and his thoughts troubled him so that the joints of his loins were loosed and his knees smote one against another 57 the king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers the chaldeans and the soothsayers and the king spake and said to the wise men of babylon whosoever shall read this writing and shew me the interpretation thereof shall be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom 58 then came in all the kings wise men but they could not read the writing nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof 59 then was king belshazzar greatly troubled and his countenance was changed in him and his lords were astonied 510 now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house and the queen spake and said o king live for ever let not thy thoughts trouble thee nor let thy countenance be changed 511 there is a man in thy kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods was found in him whom the king nebuchadnezzar thy father the king i say thy father made master of the magicians astrologers chaldeans and soothsayers 512 forasmuch as an excellent spirit and knowledge and understanding interpreting of dreams and shewing of hard sentences and dissolving of doubts were found in the same daniel whom the king named belteshazzar now let daniel be called and he will shew the interpretation 513 then was daniel brought in before the king and the king spake and said unto daniel art thou that daniel which art of the children of the captivity of judah whom the king my father brought out of jewry 514 i have even heard of thee that the spirit of the gods is in thee and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee 515 and now the wise men the astrologers have been brought in before me that they should read this writing and make known unto me the interpretation thereof but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing 516 and i have heard of thee that thou canst make interpretations and dissolve doubts now if thou canst read the writing and make known to me the interpretation thereof thou shalt be clothed with scarlet and have a chain of gold about thy neck and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom 517 then daniel answered and said before the king let thy gifts be to thyself and give thy rewards to another yet i will read the writing unto the king and make known to him the interpretation 518 o thou king the most high god gave nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom and majesty and glory and honour 519 and for the majesty that he gave him all people nations and languages trembled and feared before him whom he would he slew and whom he would he kept alive and whom he would he set up and whom he would he put down 520 but when his heart was lifted up and his mind hardened in pride he was deposed from his kingly throne and they took his glory from him 521 and he was driven from the sons of men and his heart was made like the beasts and his dwelling was with the wild asses they fed him with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till he knew that the most high god ruled in the kingdom of men and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will 522 and thou his son o belshazzar hast not humbled thine heart though thou knewest all this 523 but hast lifted up thyself against the lord of heaven and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee and thou and thy lords thy wives and thy concubines have drunk wine in them and thou hast praised the gods of silver and gold of brass iron wood and stone which see not nor hear nor know and the god in whose hand thy breath is and whose are all thy ways hast thou not glorified 524 then was the part of the hand sent from him and this writing was written 525 and this is the writing that was written mene mene tekel upharsin 526 this is the interpretation of the thing mene god hath numbered thy kingdom and finished it 527 tekel thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting 528 peres thy kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians 529 then commanded belshazzar and they clothed daniel with scarlet and put a chain of gold about his neck and made a proclamation concerning him that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom 530 in that night was belshazzar the king of the chaldeans slain 531 and darius the median took the kingdom being about threescore and two years old 61 it pleased darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes which should be over the whole kingdom 62 and over these three presidents of whom daniel was first that the princes might give accounts unto them and the king should have no damage 63 then this daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes because an excellent spirit was in him and the king thought to set him over the whole realm 64 then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor fault forasmuch as he was faithful neither was there any error or fault found in him 65 then said these men we shall not find any occasion against this daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his god 66 then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king and said thus unto him king darius live for ever 67 all the presidents of the kingdom the governors and the princes the counsellors and the captains have consulted together to establish a royal statute and to make a firm decree that whosoever shall ask a petition of any god or man for thirty days save of thee o king he shall be cast into the den of lions 68 now o king establish the decree and sign the writing that it be not changed according to the law of the medes and persians which altereth not 69 wherefore king darius signed the writing and the decree 610 now when daniel knew that the writing was signed he went into his house and his windows being open in his chamber toward jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his god as he did aforetime 611 then these men assembled and found daniel praying and making supplication before his god 612 then they came near and spake before the king concerning the kings decree hast thou not signed a decree that every man that shall ask a petition of any god or man within thirty days save of thee o king shall be cast into the den of lions the king answered and said the thing is true according to the law of the medes and persians which altereth not 613 then answered they and said before the king that daniel which is of the children of the captivity of judah regardeth not thee o king nor the decree that thou hast signed but maketh his petition three times a day 614 then the king when he heard these words was sore displeased with himself and set his heart on daniel to deliver him and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him 615 then these men assembled unto the king and said unto the king know o king that the law of the medes and persians is that no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed 616 then the king commanded and they brought daniel and cast him into the den of lions now the king spake and said unto daniel thy god whom thou servest continually he will deliver thee 617 and a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den and the king sealed it with his own signet and with the signet of his lords that the purpose might not be changed concerning daniel 618 then the king went to his palace and passed the night fasting neither were instruments of musick brought before him and his sleep went from him 619 then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste unto the den of lions 620 and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto daniel and the king spake and said to daniel o daniel servant of the living god is thy god whom thou servest continually able to deliver thee from the lions 621 then said daniel unto the king o king live for ever 622 my god hath sent his angel and hath shut the lions mouths that they have not hurt me forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me and also before thee o king have i done no hurt 623 then was the king exceedingly glad for him and commanded that they should take daniel up out of the den so daniel was taken up out of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because he believed in his god 624 and the king commanded and they brought those men which had accused daniel and they cast them into the den of lions them their children and their wives and the lions had the mastery of them and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den 625 then king darius wrote unto all people nations and languages that dwell in all the earth peace be multiplied unto you 626 i make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the god of daniel for he is the living god and stedfast for ever and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed and his dominion shall be even unto the end 627 he delivereth and rescueth and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth who hath delivered daniel from the power of the lions 628 so this daniel prospered in the reign of darius and in the reign of cyrus the persian 71 in the first year of belshazzar king of babylon daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters 72 daniel spake and said i saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great sea 73 and four great beasts came up from the sea diverse one from another 74 the first was like a lion and had eagles wings i beheld till the wings thereof were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and made stand upon the feet as a man and a mans heart was given to it 75 and behold another beast a second like to a bear and it raised up itself on one side and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it and they said thus unto it arise devour much flesh 76 after this i beheld and lo another like a leopard which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl the beast had also four heads and dominion was given to it 77 after this i saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast dreadful and terrible and strong exceedingly and it had great iron teeth it devoured and brake in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it and it had ten horns 78 i considered the horns and behold there came up among them another little horn before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots and behold in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man and a mouth speaking great things 79 i beheld till the thrones were cast down and the ancient of days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire 710 a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the judgment was set and the books were opened 711 i beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake i beheld even till the beast was slain and his body destroyed and given to the burning flame 712 as concerning the rest of the beasts they had their dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time 713 i saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him 714 and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed 715 i daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body and the visions of my head troubled me 716 i came near unto one of them that stood by and asked him the truth of all this so he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things 717 these great beasts which are four are four kings which shall arise out of the earth 718 but the saints of the most high shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom for ever even for ever and ever 719 then i would know the truth of the fourth beast which was diverse from all the others exceeding dreadful whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass which devoured brake in pieces and stamped the residue with his feet 720 and of the ten horns that were in his head and of the other which came up and before whom three fell even of that horn that had eyes and a mouth that spake very great things whose look was more stout than his fellows 721 i beheld and the same horn made war with the saints and prevailed against them 722 until the ancient of days came and judgment was given to the saints of the most high and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom 723 thus he said the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces 724 and the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise and another shall rise after them and he shall be diverse from the first and he shall subdue three kings 725 and he shall speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the saints of the most high and think to change times and laws and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time 726 but the judgment shall sit and they shall take away his dominion to consume and to destroy it unto the end 727 and the kingdom and dominion and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven shall be given to the people of the saints of the most high whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and all dominions shall serve and obey him 728 hitherto is the end of the matter as for me daniel my cogitations much troubled me and my countenance changed in me but i kept the matter in my heart 81 in the third year of the reign of king belshazzar a vision appeared unto me even unto me daniel after that which appeared unto me at the first 82 and i saw in a vision and it came to pass when i saw that i was at shushan in the palace which is in the province of elam and i saw in a vision and i was by the river of ulai 83 then i lifted up mine eyes and saw and behold there stood before the river a ram which had two horns and the two horns were high but one was higher than the other and the higher came up last 84 i saw the ram pushing westward and northward and southward so that no beasts might stand before him neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand but he did according to his will and became great 85 and as i was considering behold an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth and touched not the ground and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes 86 and he came to the ram that had two horns which i had seen standing before the river and ran unto him in the fury of his power 87 and i saw him come close unto the ram and he was moved with choler against him and smote the ram and brake his two horns and there was no power in the ram to stand before him but he cast him down to the ground and stamped upon him and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand 88 therefore the he goat waxed very great and when he was strong the great horn was broken and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven 89 and out of one of them came forth a little horn which waxed exceeding great toward the south and toward the east and toward the pleasant land 810 and it waxed great even to the host of heaven and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground and stamped upon them 811 yea he magnified himself even to the prince of the host and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away and the place of the sanctuary was cast down 812 and an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression and it cast down the truth to the ground and it practised and prospered 813 then i heard one saint speaking and another saint said unto that certain saint which spake how long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice and the transgression of desolation to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot 814 and he said unto me unto two thousand and three hundred days then shall the sanctuary be cleansed 815 and it came to pass when i even i daniel had seen the vision and sought for the meaning then behold there stood before me as the appearance of a man 816 and i heard a mans voice between the banks of ulai which called and said gabriel make this man to understand the vision 817 so he came near where i stood and when he came i was afraid and fell upon my face but he said unto me understand o son of man for at the time of the end shall be the vision 818 now as he was speaking with me i was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground but he touched me and set me upright 819 and he said behold i will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation for at the time appointed the end shall be 820 the ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of media and persia 821 and the rough goat is the king of grecia and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king 822 now that being broken whereas four stood up for it four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation but not in his power 823 and in the latter time of their kingdom when the transgressors are come to the full a king of fierce countenance and understanding dark sentences shall stand up 824 and his power shall be mighty but not by his own power and he shall destroy wonderfully and shall prosper and practise and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people 825 and through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand and he shall magnify himself in his heart and by peace shall destroy many he shall also stand up against the prince of princes but he shall be broken without hand 826 and the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true wherefore shut thou up the vision for it shall be for many days 827 and i daniel fainted and was sick certain days afterward i rose up and did the kings business and i was astonished at the vision but none understood it 91 in the first year of darius the son of ahasuerus of the seed of the medes which was made king over the realm of the chaldeans 92 in the first year of his reign i daniel understood by books the number of the years whereof the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of jerusalem 93 and i set my face unto the lord god to seek by prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and ashes 94 and i prayed unto the lord my god and made my confession and said o lord the great and dreadful god keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his commandments 95 we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments 96 neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets which spake in thy name to our kings our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land 97 o lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion of faces as at this day to the men of judah and to the inhabitants of jerusalem and unto all israel that are near and that are far off through all the countries whither thou hast driven them because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee 98 o lord to us belongeth confusion of face to our kings to our princes and to our fathers because we have sinned against thee 99 to the lord our god belong mercies and forgivenesses though we have rebelled against him 910 neither have we obeyed the voice of the lord our god to walk in his laws which he set before us by his servants the prophets 911 yea all israel have transgressed thy law even by departing that they might not obey thy voice therefore the curse is poured upon us and the oath that is written in the law of moses the servant of god because we have sinned against him 912 and he hath confirmed his words which he spake against us and against our judges that judged us by bringing upon us a great evil for under the whole heaven hath not been done as hath been done upon jerusalem 913 as it is written in the law of moses all this evil is come upon us yet made we not our prayer before the lord our god that we might turn from our iniquities and understand thy truth 914 therefore hath the lord watched upon the evil and brought it upon us for the lord our god is righteous in all his works which he doeth for we obeyed not his voice 915 and now o lord our god that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of egypt with a mighty hand and hast gotten thee renown as at this day we have sinned we have done wickedly 916 o lord according to all thy righteousness i beseech thee let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city jerusalem thy holy mountain because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are about us 917 now therefore o our god hear the prayer of thy servant and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is desolate for the lords sake 918 o my god incline thine ear and hear open thine eyes and behold our desolations and the city which is called by thy name for we do not present our supplications before thee for our righteousnesses but for thy great mercies 919 o lord hear o lord forgive o lord hearken and do defer not for thine own sake o my god for thy city and thy people are called by thy name 920 and whiles i was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people israel and presenting my supplication before the lord my god for the holy mountain of my god 921 yea whiles i was speaking in prayer even the man gabriel whom i had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation 922 and he informed me and talked with me and said o daniel i am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding 923 at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came forth and i am come to shew thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision 924 seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the transgression and to make an end of sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy 925 know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build jerusalem unto the messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times 926 and after threescore and two weeks shall messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and unto the end of the war desolations are determined 927 and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate 101 in the third year of cyrus king of persia a thing was revealed unto daniel whose name was called belteshazzar and the thing was true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and had understanding of the vision 102 in those days i daniel was mourning three full weeks 103 i ate no pleasant bread neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth neither did i anoint myself at all till three whole weeks were fulfilled 104 and in the four and twentieth day of the first month as i was by the side of the great river which is hiddekel 105 then i lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with fine gold of uphaz 106 his body also was like the beryl and his face as the appearance of lightning and his eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude 107 and i daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with me saw not the vision but a great quaking fell upon them so that they fled to hide themselves 108 therefore i was left alone and saw this great vision and there remained no strength in me for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption and i retained no strength 109 yet heard i the voice of his words and when i heard the voice of his words then was i in a deep sleep on my face and my face toward the ground 1010 and behold an hand touched me which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands 1011 and he said unto me o daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that i speak unto thee and stand upright for unto thee am i now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me i stood trembling 1012 then said he unto me fear not daniel for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand and to chasten thyself before thy god thy words were heard and i am come for thy words 1013 but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me one and twenty days but lo michael one of the chief princes came to help me and i remained there with the kings of persia 1014 now i am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for many days 1015 and when he had spoken such words unto me i set my face toward the ground and i became dumb 1016 and behold one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips then i opened my mouth and spake and said unto him that stood before me o my lord by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me and i have retained no strength 1017 for how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord for as for me straightway there remained no strength in me neither is there breath left in me 1018 then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man and he strengthened me 1019 and said o man greatly beloved fear not peace be unto thee be strong yea be strong and when he had spoken unto me i was strengthened and said let my lord speak for thou hast strengthened me 1020 then said he knowest thou wherefore i come unto thee and now will i return to fight with the prince of persia and when i am gone forth lo the prince of grecia shall come 1021 but i will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth and there is none that holdeth with me in these things but michael your prince 111 also i in the first year of darius the mede even i stood to confirm and to strengthen him 112 and now will i shew thee the truth behold there shall stand up yet three kings in persia and the fourth shall be far richer than they all and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of grecia 113 and a mighty king shall stand up that shall rule with great dominion and do according to his will 114 and when he shall stand up his kingdom shall be broken and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven and not to his posterity nor according to his dominion which he ruled for his kingdom shall be plucked up even for others beside those 115 and the king of the south shall be strong and one of his princes and he shall be strong above him and have dominion his dominion shall be a great dominion 116 and in the end of years they shall join themselves together for the kings daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement but she shall not retain the power of the arm neither shall he stand nor his arm but she shall be given up and they that brought her and he that begat her and he that strengthened her in these times 117 but out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate which shall come with an army and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north and shall deal against them and shall prevail 118 and shall also carry captives into egypt their gods with their princes and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold and he shall continue more years than the king of the north 119 so the king of the south shall come into his kingdom and shall return into his own land 1110 but his sons shall be stirred up and shall assemble a multitude of great forces and one shall certainly come and overflow and pass through then shall he return and be stirred up even to his fortress 1111 and the king of the south shall be moved with choler and shall come forth and fight with him even with the king of the north and he shall set forth a great multitude but the multitude shall be given into his hand 1112 and when he hath taken away the multitude his heart shall be lifted up and he shall cast down many ten thousands but he shall not be strengthened by it 1113 for the king of the north shall return and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches 1114 and in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to establish the vision but they shall fall 1115 so the king of the north shall come and cast up a mount and take the most fenced cities and the arms of the south shall not withstand neither his chosen people neither shall there be any strength to withstand 1116 but he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will and none shall stand before him and he shall stand in the glorious land which by his hand shall be consumed 1117 he shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom and upright ones with him thus shall he do and he shall give him the daughter of women corrupting her but she shall not stand on his side neither be for him 1118 after this shall he turn his face unto the isles and shall take many but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn upon him 1119 then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land but he shall stumble and fall and not be found 1120 then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom but within few days he shall be destroyed neither in anger nor in battle 1121 and in his estate shall stand up a vile person to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom but he shall come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries 1122 and with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him and shall be broken yea also the prince of the covenant 1123 and after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully for he shall come up and shall become strong with a small people 1124 he shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province and he shall do that which his fathers have not done nor his fathers fathers he shall scatter among them the prey and spoil and riches yea and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds even for a time 1125 and he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army but he shall not stand for they shall forecast devices against him 1126 yea they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him and his army shall overflow and many shall fall down slain 1127 and both of these kings hearts shall be to do mischief and they shall speak lies at one table but it shall not prosper for yet the end shall be at the time appointed 1128 then shall he return into his land with great riches and his heart shall be against the holy covenant and he shall do exploits and return to his own land 1129 at the time appointed he shall return and come toward the south but it shall not be as the former or as the latter 1130 for the ships of chittim shall come against him therefore he shall be grieved and return and have indignation against the holy covenant so shall he do he shall even return and have intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant 1131 and arms shall stand on his part and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength and shall take away the daily sacrifice and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate 1132 and such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know their god shall be strong and do exploits 1133 and they that understand among the people shall instruct many yet they shall fall by the sword and by flame by captivity and by spoil many days 1134 now when they shall fall they shall be holpen with a little help but many shall cleave to them with flatteries 1135 and some of them of understanding shall fall to try them and to purge and to make them white even to the time of the end because it is yet for a time appointed 1136 and the king shall do according to his will and he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god and shall speak marvellous things against the god of gods and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished for that that is determined shall be done 1137 neither shall he regard the god of his fathers nor the desire of women nor regard any god for he shall magnify himself above all 1138 but in his estate shall he honour the god of forces and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold and silver and with precious stones and pleasant things 1139 thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory and he shall cause them to rule over many and shall divide the land for gain 1140 and at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships and he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass over 1141 he shall enter also into the glorious land and many countries shall be overthrown but these shall escape out of his hand even edom and moab and the chief of the children of ammon 1142 he shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries and the land of egypt shall not escape 1143 but he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver and over all the precious things of egypt and the libyans and the ethiopians shall be at his steps 1144 but tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and utterly to make away many 1145 and he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain yet he shall come to his end and none shall help him 121 and at that time shall michael stand up the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book 122 and many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt 123 and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever 124 but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased 125 then i daniel looked and behold there stood other two the one on this side of the bank of the river and the other on that side of the bank of the river 126 and one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river how long shall it be to the end of these wonders 127 and i heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and sware by him that liveth for ever that it shall be for a time times and an half and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished 128 and i heard but i understood not then said i o my lord what shall be the end of these things 129 and he said go thy way daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end 1210 many shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand 1211 and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination that maketh desolate set up there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days 1212 blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days 1213 but go thou thy way till the end be for thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of the days hosea 11 the word of the lord that came unto hosea the son of beeri in the days of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel 12 the beginning of the word of the lord by hosea and the lord said to hosea go take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and children of whoredoms for the land hath committed great whoredom departing from the lord 13 so he went and took gomer the daughter of diblaim which conceived and bare him a son 14 and the lord said unto him call his name jezreel for yet a little while and i will avenge the blood of jezreel upon the house of jehu and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of israel 15 and it shall come to pass at that day that i will break the bow of israel in the valley of jezreel 16 and she conceived again and bare a daughter and god said unto him call her name loruhamah for i will no more have mercy upon the house of israel but i will utterly take them away 17 but i will have mercy upon the house of judah and will save them by the lord their god and will not save them by bow nor by sword nor by battle by horses nor by horsemen 18 now when she had weaned loruhamah she conceived and bare a son 19 then said god call his name loammi for ye are not my people and i will not be your god 110 yet the number of the children of israel shall be as the sand of the sea which cannot be measured nor numbered and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there it shall be said unto them ye are the sons of the living god 111 then shall the children of judah and the children of israel be gathered together and appoint themselves one head and they shall come up out of the land for great shall be the day of jezreel 21 say ye unto your brethren ammi and to your sisters ruhamah 22 plead with your mother plead for she is not my wife neither am i her husband let her therefore put away her whoredoms out of her sight and her adulteries from between her breasts 23 lest i strip her naked and set her as in the day that she was born and make her as a wilderness and set her like a dry land and slay her with thirst 24 and i will not have mercy upon her children for they be the children of whoredoms 25 for their mother hath played the harlot she that conceived them hath done shamefully for she said i will go after my lovers that give me my bread and my water my wool and my flax mine oil and my drink 26 therefore behold i will hedge up thy way with thorns and make a wall that she shall not find her paths 27 and she shall follow after her lovers but she shall not overtake them and she shall seek them but shall not find them then shall she say i will go and return to my first husband for then was it better with me than now 28 for she did not know that i gave her corn and wine and oil and multiplied her silver and gold which they prepared for baal 29 therefore will i return and take away my corn in the time thereof and my wine in the season thereof and will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness 210 and now will i discover her lewdness in the sight of her lovers and none shall deliver her out of mine hand 211 i will also cause all her mirth to cease her feast days her new moons and her sabbaths and all her solemn feasts 212 and i will destroy her vines and her fig trees whereof she hath said these are my rewards that my lovers have given me and i will make them a forest and the beasts of the field shall eat them 213 and i will visit upon her the days of baalim wherein she burned incense to them and she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels and she went after her lovers and forgat me saith the lord 214 therefore behold i will allure her and bring her into the wilderness and speak comfortably unto her 215 and i will give her her vineyards from thence and the valley of achor for a door of hope and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of egypt 216 and it shall be at that day saith the lord that thou shalt call me ishi and shalt call me no more baali 217 for i will take away the names of baalim out of her mouth and they shall no more be remembered by their name 218 and in that day will i make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven and with the creeping things of the ground and i will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the earth and will make them to lie down safely 219 and i will betroth thee unto me for ever yea i will betroth thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in lovingkindness and in mercies 220 i will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness and thou shalt know the lord 221 and it shall come to pass in that day i will hear saith the lord i will hear the heavens and they shall hear the earth 222 and the earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and they shall hear jezreel 223 and i will sow her unto me in the earth and i will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy and i will say to them which were not my people thou art my people and they shall say thou art my god 31 then said the lord unto me go yet love a woman beloved of her friend yet an adulteress according to the love of the lord toward the children of israel who look to other gods and love flagons of wine 32 so i bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and for an homer of barley and an half homer of barley 33 and i said unto her thou shalt abide for me many days thou shalt not play the harlot and thou shalt not be for another man so will i also be for thee 34 for the children of israel shall abide many days without a king and without a prince and without a sacrifice and without an image and without an ephod and without teraphim 35 afterward shall the children of israel return and seek the lord their god and david their king and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latter days 41 hear the word of the lord ye children of israel for the lord hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land because there is no truth nor mercy nor knowledge of god in the land 42 by swearing and lying and killing and stealing and committing adultery they break out and blood toucheth blood 43 therefore shall the land mourn and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven yea the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away 44 yet let no man strive nor reprove another for thy people are as they that strive with the priest 45 therefore shalt thou fall in the day and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night and i will destroy thy mother 46 my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because thou hast rejected knowledge i will also reject thee that thou shalt be no priest to me seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy god i will also forget thy children 47 as they were increased so they sinned against me therefore will i change their glory into shame 48 they eat up the sin of my people and they set their heart on their iniquity 49 and there shall be like people like priest and i will punish them for their ways and reward them their doings 410 for they shall eat and not have enough they shall commit whoredom and shall not increase because they have left off to take heed to the lord 411 whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart 412 my people ask counsel at their stocks and their staff declareth unto them for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err and they have gone a whoring from under their god 413 they sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains and burn incense upon the hills under oaks and poplars and elms because the shadow thereof is good therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom and your spouses shall commit adultery 414 i will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom nor your spouses when they commit adultery for themselves are separated with whores and they sacrifice with harlots therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall 415 though thou israel play the harlot yet let not judah offend and come not ye unto gilgal neither go ye up to bethaven nor swear the lord liveth 416 for israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer now the lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place 417 ephraim is joined to idols let him alone 418 their drink is sour they have committed whoredom continually her rulers with shame do love give ye 419 the wind hath bound her up in her wings and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices 51 hear ye this o priests and hearken ye house of israel and give ye ear o house of the king for judgment is toward you because ye have been a snare on mizpah and a net spread upon tabor 52 and the revolters are profound to make slaughter though i have been a rebuker of them all 53 i know ephraim and israel is not hid from me for now o ephraim thou committest whoredom and israel is defiled 54 they will not frame their doings to turn unto their god for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them and they have not known the lord 55 and the pride of israel doth testify to his face therefore shall israel and ephraim fall in their iniquity judah also shall fall with them 56 they shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the lord but they shall not find him he hath withdrawn himself from them 57 they have dealt treacherously against the lord for they have begotten strange children now shall a month devour them with their portions 58 blow ye the cornet in gibeah and the trumpet in ramah cry aloud at bethaven after thee o benjamin 59 ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke among the tribes of israel have i made known that which shall surely be 510 the princes of judah were like them that remove the bound therefore i will pour out my wrath upon them like water 511 ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment because he willingly walked after the commandment 512 therefore will i be unto ephraim as a moth and to the house of judah as rottenness 513 when ephraim saw his sickness and judah saw his wound then went ephraim to the assyrian and sent to king jareb yet could he not heal you nor cure you of your wound 514 for i will be unto ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to the house of judah i even i will tear and go away i will take away and none shall rescue him 515 i will go and return to my place till they acknowledge their offence and seek my face in their affliction they will seek me early 61 come and let us return unto the lord for he hath torn and he will heal us he hath smitten and he will bind us up 62 after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight 63 then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain unto the earth 64 o ephraim what shall i do unto thee o judah what shall i do unto thee for your goodness is as a morning cloud and as the early dew it goeth away 65 therefore have i hewed them by the prophets i have slain them by the words of my mouth and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth 66 for i desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of god more than burnt offerings 67 but they like men have transgressed the covenant there have they dealt treacherously against me 68 gilead is a city of them that work iniquity and is polluted with blood 69 and as troops of robbers wait for a man so the company of priests murder in the way by consent for they commit lewdness 610 i have seen an horrible thing in the house of israel there is the whoredom of ephraim israel is defiled 611 also o judah he hath set an harvest for thee when i returned the captivity of my people 71 when i would have healed israel then the iniquity of ephraim was discovered and the wickedness of samaria for they commit falsehood and the thief cometh in and the troop of robbers spoileth without 72 and they consider not in their hearts that i remember all their wickedness now their own doings have beset them about they are before my face 73 they make the king glad with their wickedness and the princes with their lies 74 they are all adulterers as an oven heated by the baker who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough until it be leavened 75 in the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine he stretched out his hand with scorners 76 for they have made ready their heart like an oven whiles they lie in wait their baker sleepeth all the night in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire 77 they are all hot as an oven and have devoured their judges all their kings are fallen there is none among them that calleth unto me 78 ephraim he hath mixed himself among the people ephraim is a cake not turned 79 strangers have devoured his strength and he knoweth it not yea gray hairs are here and there upon him yet he knoweth not 710 and the pride of israel testifieth to his face and they do not return to the lord their god nor seek him for all this 711 ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart they call to egypt they go to assyria 712 when they shall go i will spread my net upon them i will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven i will chastise them as their congregation hath heard 713 woe unto them for they have fled from me destruction unto them because they have transgressed against me though i have redeemed them yet they have spoken lies against me 714 and they have not cried unto me with their heart when they howled upon their beds they assemble themselves for corn and wine and they rebel against me 715 though i have bound and strengthened their arms yet do they imagine mischief against me 716 they return but not to the most high they are like a deceitful bow their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue this shall be their derision in the land of egypt 81 set the trumpet to thy mouth he shall come as an eagle against the house of the lord because they have transgressed my covenant and trespassed against my law 82 israel shall cry unto me my god we know thee 83 israel hath cast off the thing that is good the enemy shall pursue him 84 they have set up kings but not by me they have made princes and i knew it not of their silver and their gold have they made them idols that they may be cut off 85 thy calf o samaria hath cast thee off mine anger is kindled against them how long will it be ere they attain to innocency 86 for from israel was it also the workman made it therefore it is not god but the calf of samaria shall be broken in pieces 87 for they have sown the wind and they shall reap the whirlwind it hath no stalk the bud shall yield no meal if so be it yield the strangers shall swallow it up 88 israel is swallowed up now shall they be among the gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure 89 for they are gone up to assyria a wild ass alone by himself ephraim hath hired lovers 810 yea though they have hired among the nations now will i gather them and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes 811 because ephraim hath made many altars to sin altars shall be unto him to sin 812 i have written to him the great things of my law but they were counted as a strange thing 813 they sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings and eat it but the lord accepteth them not now will he remember their iniquity and visit their sins they shall return to egypt 814 for israel hath forgotten his maker and buildeth temples and judah hath multiplied fenced cities but i will send a fire upon his cities and it shall devour the palaces thereof 91 rejoice not o israel for joy as other people for thou hast gone a whoring from thy god thou hast loved a reward upon every cornfloor 92 the floor and the winepress shall not feed them and the new wine shall fail in her 93 they shall not dwell in the lords land but ephraim shall return to egypt and they shall eat unclean things in assyria 94 they shall not offer wine offerings to the lord neither shall they be pleasing unto him their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners all that eat thereof shall be polluted for their bread for their soul shall not come into the house of the lord 95 what will ye do in the solemn day and in the day of the feast of the lord 96 for lo they are gone because of destruction egypt shall gather them up memphis shall bury them the pleasant places for their silver nettles shall possess them thorns shall be in their tabernacles 97 the days of visitation are come the days of recompence are come israel shall know it the prophet is a fool the spiritual man is mad for the multitude of thine iniquity and the great hatred 98 the watchman of ephraim was with my god but the prophet is a snare of a fowler in all his ways and hatred in the house of his god 99 they have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of gibeah therefore he will remember their iniquity he will visit their sins 910 i found israel like grapes in the wilderness i saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time but they went to baalpeor and separated themselves unto that shame and their abominations were according as they loved 911 as for ephraim their glory shall fly away like a bird from the birth and from the womb and from the conception 912 though they bring up their children yet will i bereave them that there shall not be a man left yea woe also to them when i depart from them 913 ephraim as i saw tyrus is planted in a pleasant place but ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer 914 give them o lord what wilt thou give give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts 915 all their wickedness is in gilgal for there i hated them for the wickedness of their doings i will drive them out of mine house i will love them no more all their princes are revolters 916 ephraim is smitten their root is dried up they shall bear no fruit yea though they bring forth yet will i slay even the beloved fruit of their womb 917 my god will cast them away because they did not hearken unto him and they shall be wanderers among the nations 101 israel is an empty vine he bringeth forth fruit unto himself according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images 102 their heart is divided now shall they be found faulty he shall break down their altars he shall spoil their images 103 for now they shall say we have no king because we feared not the lord what then should a king do to us 104 they have spoken words swearing falsely in making a covenant thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field 105 the inhabitants of samaria shall fear because of the calves of bethaven for the people thereof shall mourn over it and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it for the glory thereof because it is departed from it 106 it shall be also carried unto assyria for a present to king jareb ephraim shall receive shame and israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel 107 as for samaria her king is cut off as the foam upon the water 108 the high places also of aven the sin of israel shall be destroyed the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars and they shall say to the mountains cover us and to the hills fall on us 109 o israel thou hast sinned from the days of gibeah there they stood the battle in gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them 1010 it is in my desire that i should chastise them and the people shall be gathered against them when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows 1011 and ephraim is as an heifer that is taught and loveth to tread out the corn but i passed over upon her fair neck i will make ephraim to ride judah shall plow and jacob shall break his clods 1012 sow to yourselves in righteousness reap in mercy break up your fallow ground for it is time to seek the lord till he come and rain righteousness upon you 1013 ye have plowed wickedness ye have reaped iniquity ye have eaten the fruit of lies because thou didst trust in thy way in the multitude of thy mighty men 1014 therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled as shalman spoiled betharbel in the day of battle the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children 1015 so shall bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness in a morning shall the king of israel utterly be cut off 111 when israel was a child then i loved him and called my son out of egypt 112 as they called them so they went from them they sacrificed unto baalim and burned incense to graven images 113 i taught ephraim also to go taking them by their arms but they knew not that i healed them 114 i drew them with cords of a man with bands of love and i was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws and i laid meat unto them 115 he shall not return into the land of egypt and the assyrian shall be his king because they refused to return 116 and the sword shall abide on his cities and shall consume his branches and devour them because of their own counsels 117 and my people are bent to backsliding from me though they called them to the most high none at all would exalt him 118 how shall i give thee up ephraim how shall i deliver thee israel how shall i make thee as admah how shall i set thee as zeboim mine heart is turned within me my repentings are kindled together 119 i will not execute the fierceness of mine anger i will not return to destroy ephraim for i am god and not man the holy one in the midst of thee and i will not enter into the city 1110 they shall walk after the lord he shall roar like a lion when he shall roar then the children shall tremble from the west 1111 they shall tremble as a bird out of egypt and as a dove out of the land of assyria and i will place them in their houses saith the lord 1112 ephraim compasseth me about with lies and the house of israel with deceit but judah yet ruleth with god and is faithful with the saints 121 ephraim feedeth on wind and followeth after the east wind he daily increaseth lies and desolation and they do make a covenant with the assyrians and oil is carried into egypt 122 the lord hath also a controversy with judah and will punish jacob according to his ways according to his doings will he recompense him 123 he took his brother by the heel in the womb and by his strength he had power with god 124 yea he had power over the angel and prevailed he wept and made supplication unto him he found him in bethel and there he spake with us 125 even the lord god of hosts the lord is his memorial 126 therefore turn thou to thy god keep mercy and judgment and wait on thy god continually 127 he is a merchant the balances of deceit are in his hand he loveth to oppress 128 and ephraim said yet i am become rich i have found me out substance in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin 129 and i that am the lord thy god from the land of egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles as in the days of the solemn feast 1210 i have also spoken by the prophets and i have multiplied visions and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets 1211 is there iniquity in gilead surely they are vanity they sacrifice bullocks in gilgal yea their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields 1212 and jacob fled into the country of syria and israel served for a wife and for a wife he kept sheep 1213 and by a prophet the lord brought israel out of egypt and by a prophet was he preserved 1214 ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly therefore shall he leave his blood upon him and his reproach shall his lord return unto him 131 when ephraim spake trembling he exalted himself in israel but when he offended in baal he died 132 and now they sin more and more and have made them molten images of their silver and idols according to their own understanding all of it the work of the craftsmen they say of them let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves 133 therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passeth away as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor and as the smoke out of the chimney 134 yet i am the lord thy god from the land of egypt and thou shalt know no god but me for there is no saviour beside me 135 i did know thee in the wilderness in the land of great drought 136 according to their pasture so were they filled they were filled and their heart was exalted therefore have they forgotten me 137 therefore i will be unto them as a lion as a leopard by the way will i observe them 138 i will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps and will rend the caul of their heart and there will i devour them like a lion the wild beast shall tear them 139 o israel thou hast destroyed thyself but in me is thine help 1310 i will be thy king where is any other that may save thee in all thy cities and thy judges of whom thou saidst give me a king and princes 1311 i gave thee a king in mine anger and took him away in my wrath 1312 the iniquity of ephraim is bound up his sin is hid 1313 the sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him he is an unwise son for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children 1314 i will ransom them from the power of the grave i will redeem them from death o death i will be thy plagues o grave i will be thy destruction repentance shall be hid from mine eyes 1315 though he be fruitful among his brethren an east wind shall come the wind of the lord shall come up from the wilderness and his spring shall become dry and his fountain shall be dried up he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels 1316 samaria shall become desolate for she hath rebelled against her god they shall fall by the sword their infants shall be dashed in pieces and their women with child shall be ripped up 141 o israel return unto the lord thy god for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity 142 take with you words and turn to the lord say unto him take away all iniquity and receive us graciously so will we render the calves of our lips 143 asshur shall not save us we will not ride upon horses neither will we say any more to the work of our hands ye are our gods for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy 144 i will heal their backsliding i will love them freely for mine anger is turned away from him 145 i will be as the dew unto israel he shall grow as the lily and cast forth his roots as lebanon 146 his branches shall spread and his beauty shall be as the olive tree and his smell as lebanon 147 they that dwell under his shadow shall return they shall revive as the corn and grow as the vine the scent thereof shall be as the wine of lebanon 148 ephraim shall say what have i to do any more with idols i have heard him and observed him i am like a green fir tree from me is thy fruit found 149 who is wise and he shall understand these things prudent and he shall know them for the ways of the lord are right and the just shall walk in them but the transgressors shall fall therein joel 11 the word of the lord that came to joel the son of pethuel 12 hear this ye old men and give ear all ye inhabitants of the land hath this been in your days or even in the days of your fathers 13 tell ye your children of it and let your children tell their children and their children another generation 14 that which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten 15 awake ye drunkards and weep and howl all ye drinkers of wine because of the new wine for it is cut off from your mouth 16 for a nation is come up upon my land strong and without number whose teeth are the teeth of a lion and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion 17 he hath laid my vine waste and barked my fig tree he hath made it clean bare and cast it away the branches thereof are made white 18 lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth 19 the meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the lord the priests the lords ministers mourn 110 the field is wasted the land mourneth for the corn is wasted the new wine is dried up the oil languisheth 111 be ye ashamed o ye husbandmen howl o ye vinedressers for the wheat and for the barley because the harvest of the field is perished 112 the vine is dried up and the fig tree languisheth the pomegranate tree the palm tree also and the apple tree even all the trees of the field are withered because joy is withered away from the sons of men 113 gird yourselves and lament ye priests howl ye ministers of the altar come lie all night in sackcloth ye ministers of my god for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your god 114 sanctify ye a fast call a solemn assembly gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the lord your god and cry unto the lord 115 alas for the day for the day of the lord is at hand and as a destruction from the almighty shall it come 116 is not the meat cut off before our eyes yea joy and gladness from the house of our god 117 the seed is rotten under their clods the garners are laid desolate the barns are broken down for the corn is withered 118 how do the beasts groan the herds of cattle are perplexed because they have no pasture yea the flocks of sheep are made desolate 119 o lord to thee will i cry for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field 120 the beasts of the field cry also unto thee for the rivers of waters are dried up and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness 21 blow ye the trumpet in zion and sound an alarm in my holy mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the lord cometh for it is nigh at hand 22 a day of darkness and of gloominess a day of clouds and of thick darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains a great people and a strong there hath not been ever the like neither shall be any more after it even to the years of many generations 23 a fire devoureth before them and behind them a flame burneth the land is as the garden of eden before them and behind them a desolate wilderness yea and nothing shall escape them 24 the appearance of them is as the appearance of horses and as horsemen so shall they run 25 like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they leap like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble as a strong people set in battle array 26 before their face the people shall be much pained all faces shall gather blackness 27 they shall run like mighty men they shall climb the wall like men of war and they shall march every one on his ways and they shall not break their ranks 28 neither shall one thrust another they shall walk every one in his path and when they fall upon the sword they shall not be wounded 29 they shall run to and fro in the city they shall run upon the wall they shall climb up upon the houses they shall enter in at the windows like a thief 210 the earth shall quake before them the heavens shall tremble the sun and the moon shall be dark and the stars shall withdraw their shining 211 and the lord shall utter his voice before his army for his camp is very great for he is strong that executeth his word for the day of the lord is great and very terrible and who can abide it 212 therefore also now saith the lord turn ye even to me with all your heart and with fasting and with weeping and with mourning 213 and rend your heart and not your garments and turn unto the lord your god for he is gracious and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repenteth him of the evil 214 who knoweth if he will return and repent and leave a blessing behind him even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the lord your god 215 blow the trumpet in zion sanctify a fast call a solemn assembly 216 gather the people sanctify the congregation assemble the elders gather the children and those that suck the breasts let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of her closet 217 let the priests the ministers of the lord weep between the porch and the altar and let them say spare thy people o lord and give not thine heritage to reproach that the heathen should rule over them wherefore should they say among the people where is their god 218 then will the lord be jealous for his land and pity his people 219 yea the lord will answer and say unto his people behold i will send you corn and wine and oil and ye shall be satisfied therewith and i will no more make you a reproach among the heathen 220 but i will remove far off from you the northern army and will drive him into a land barren and desolate with his face toward the east sea and his hinder part toward the utmost sea and his stink shall come up and his ill savour shall come up because he hath done great things 221 fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the lord will do great things 222 be not afraid ye beasts of the field for the pastures of the wilderness do spring for the tree beareth her fruit the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength 223 be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month 224 and the floors shall be full of wheat and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil 225 and i will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpiller and the palmerworm my great army which i sent among you 226 and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed 227 and ye shall know that i am in the midst of israel and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed 228 and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions 229 and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit 230 and i will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth blood and fire and pillars of smoke 231 the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come 232 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered for in mount zion and in jerusalem shall be deliverance as the lord hath said and in the remnant whom the lord shall call 31 for behold in those days and in that time when i shall bring again the captivity of judah and jerusalem 32 i will also gather all nations and will bring them down into the valley of jehoshaphat and will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage israel whom they have scattered among the nations and parted my land 33 and they have cast lots for my people and have given a boy for an harlot and sold a girl for wine that they might drink 34 yea and what have ye to do with me o tyre and zidon and all the coasts of palestine will ye render me a recompence and if ye recompense me swiftly and speedily will i return your recompence upon your own head 35 because ye have taken my silver and my gold and have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things 36 the children also of judah and the children of jerusalem have ye sold unto the grecians that ye might remove them far from their border 37 behold i will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold them and will return your recompence upon your own head 38 and i will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of judah and they shall sell them to the sabeans to a people far off for the lord hath spoken it 39 proclaim ye this among the gentiles prepare war wake up the mighty men let all the men of war draw near let them come up 310 beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears let the weak say i am strong 311 assemble yourselves and come all ye heathen and gather yourselves together round about thither cause thy mighty ones to come down o lord 312 let the heathen be wakened and come up to the valley of jehoshaphat for there will i sit to judge all the heathen round about 313 put ye in the sickle for the harvest is ripe come get you down for the press is full the fats overflow for their wickedness is great 314 multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of the lord is near in the valley of decision 315 the sun and the moon shall be darkened and the stars shall withdraw their shining 316 the lord also shall roar out of zion and utter his voice from jerusalem and the heavens and the earth shall shake but the lord will be the hope of his people and the strength of the children of israel 317 so shall ye know that i am the lord your god dwelling in zion my holy mountain then shall jerusalem be holy and there shall no strangers pass through her any more 318 and it shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop down new wine and the hills shall flow with milk and all the rivers of judah shall flow with waters and a fountain shall come forth out of the house of the lord and shall water the valley of shittim 319 egypt shall be a desolation and edom shall be a desolate wilderness for the violence against the children of judah because they have shed innocent blood in their land 320 but judah shall dwell for ever and jerusalem from generation to generation 321 for i will cleanse their blood that i have not cleansed for the lord dwelleth in zion amos 11 the words of amos who was among the herdmen of tekoa which he saw concerning israel in the days of uzziah king of judah and in the days of jeroboam the son of joash king of israel two years before the earthquake 12 and he said the lord will roar from zion and utter his voice from jerusalem and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn and the top of carmel shall wither 13 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of damascus and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have threshed gilead with threshing instruments of iron 14 but i will send a fire into the house of hazael which shall devour the palaces of benhadad 15 i will break also the bar of damascus and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of aven and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of eden and the people of syria shall go into captivity unto kir saith the lord 16 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of gaza and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they carried away captive the whole captivity to deliver them up to edom 17 but i will send a fire on the wall of gaza which shall devour the palaces thereof 18 and i will cut off the inhabitant from ashdod and him that holdeth the sceptre from ashkelon and i will turn mine hand against ekron and the remnant of the philistines shall perish saith the lord god 19 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of tyrus and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they delivered up the whole captivity to edom and remembered not the brotherly covenant 110 but i will send a fire on the wall of tyrus which shall devour the palaces thereof 111 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of edom and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because he did pursue his brother with the sword and did cast off all pity and his anger did tear perpetually and he kept his wrath for ever 112 but i will send a fire upon teman which shall devour the palaces of bozrah 113 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of the children of ammon and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have ripped up the women with child of gilead that they might enlarge their border 114 but i will kindle a fire in the wall of rabbah and it shall devour the palaces thereof with shouting in the day of battle with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind 115 and their king shall go into captivity he and his princes together saith the lord 21 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of moab and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because he burned the bones of the king of edom into lime 22 but i will send a fire upon moab and it shall devour the palaces of kirioth and moab shall die with tumult with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet 23 and i will cut off the judge from the midst thereof and will slay all the princes thereof with him saith the lord 24 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of judah and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they have despised the law of the lord and have not kept his commandments and their lies caused them to err after the which their fathers have walked 25 but i will send a fire upon judah and it shall devour the palaces of jerusalem 26 thus saith the lord for three transgressions of israel and for four i will not turn away the punishment thereof because they sold the righteous for silver and the poor for a pair of shoes 27 that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor and turn aside the way of the meek and a man and his father will go in unto the same maid to profane my holy name 28 and they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by every altar and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god 29 yet destroyed i the amorite before them whose height was like the height of the cedars and he was strong as the oaks yet i destroyed his fruit from above and his roots from beneath 210 also i brought you up from the land of egypt and led you forty years through the wilderness to possess the land of the amorite 211 and i raised up of your sons for prophets and of your young men for nazarites is it not even thus o ye children of israel saith the lord 212 but ye gave the nazarites wine to drink and commanded the prophets saying prophesy not 213 behold i am pressed under you as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves 214 therefore the flight shall perish from the swift and the strong shall not strengthen his force neither shall the mighty deliver himself 215 neither shall he stand that handleth the bow and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself 216 and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day saith the lord 31 hear this word that the lord hath spoken against you o children of israel against the whole family which i brought up from the land of egypt saying 32 you only have i known of all the families of the earth therefore i will punish you for all your iniquities 33 can two walk together except they be agreed 34 will a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he have taken nothing 35 can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth where no gin is for him shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken nothing at all 36 shall a trumpet be blown in the city and the people not be afraid shall there be evil in a city and the lord hath not done it 37 surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets 38 the lion hath roared who will not fear the lord god hath spoken who can but prophesy 39 publish in the palaces at ashdod and in the palaces in the land of egypt and say assemble yourselves upon the mountains of samaria and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof and the oppressed in the midst thereof 310 for they know not to do right saith the lord who store up violence and robbery in their palaces 311 therefore thus saith the lord god an adversary there shall be even round about the land and he shall bring down thy strength from thee and thy palaces shall be spoiled 312 thus saith the lord as the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs or a piece of an ear so shall the children of israel be taken out that dwell in samaria in the corner of a bed and in damascus in a couch 313 hear ye and testify in the house of jacob saith the lord god the god of hosts 314 that in the day that i shall visit the transgressions of israel upon him i will also visit the altars of bethel and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the ground 315 and i will smite the winter house with the summer house and the houses of ivory shall perish and the great houses shall have an end saith the lord 41 hear this word ye kine of bashan that are in the mountain of samaria which oppress the poor which crush the needy which say to their masters bring and let us drink 42 the lord god hath sworn by his holiness that lo the days shall come upon you that he will take you away with hooks and your posterity with fishhooks 43 and ye shall go out at the breaches every cow at that which is before her and ye shall cast them into the palace saith the lord 44 come to bethel and transgress at gilgal multiply transgression and bring your sacrifices every morning and your tithes after three years 45 and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven and proclaim and publish the free offerings for this liketh you o ye children of israel saith the lord god 46 and i also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities and want of bread in all your places yet have ye not returned unto me saith the lord 47 and also i have withholden the rain from you when there were yet three months to the harvest and i caused it to rain upon one city and caused it not to rain upon another city one piece was rained upon and the piece whereupon it rained not withered 48 so two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water but they were not satisfied yet have ye not returned unto me saith the lord 49 i have smitten you with blasting and mildew when your gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees increased the palmerworm devoured them yet have ye not returned unto me saith the lord 410 i have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of egypt your young men have i slain with the sword and have taken away your horses and i have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils yet have ye not returned unto me saith the lord 411 i have overthrown some of you as god overthrew sodom and gomorrah and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning yet have ye not returned unto me saith the lord 412 therefore thus will i do unto thee o israel and because i will do this unto thee prepare to meet thy god o israel 413 for lo he that formeth the mountains and createth the wind and declareth unto man what is his thought that maketh the morning darkness and treadeth upon the high places of the earth the lord the god of hosts is his name 51 hear ye this word which i take up against you even a lamentation o house of israel 52 the virgin of israel is fallen she shall no more rise she is forsaken upon her land there is none to raise her up 53 for thus saith the lord god the city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten to the house of israel 54 for thus saith the lord unto the house of israel seek ye me and ye shall live 55 but seek not bethel nor enter into gilgal and pass not to beersheba for gilgal shall surely go into captivity and bethel shall come to nought 56 seek the lord and ye shall live lest he break out like fire in the house of joseph and devour it and there be none to quench it in bethel 57 ye who turn judgment to wormwood and leave off righteousness in the earth 58 seek him that maketh the seven stars and orion and turneth the shadow of death into the morning and maketh the day dark with night that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth the lord is his name 59 that strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress 510 they hate him that rebuketh in the gate and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly 511 forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor and ye take from him burdens of wheat ye have built houses of hewn stone but ye shall not dwell in them ye have planted pleasant vineyards but ye shall not drink wine of them 512 for i know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins they afflict the just they take a bribe and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right 513 therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time for it is an evil time 514 seek good and not evil that ye may live and so the lord the god of hosts shall be with you as ye have spoken 515 hate the evil and love the good and establish judgment in the gate it may be that the lord god of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of joseph 516 therefore the lord the god of hosts the lord saith thus wailing shall be in all streets and they shall say in all the highways alas alas and they shall call the husbandman to mourning and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing 517 and in all vineyards shall be wailing for i will pass through thee saith the lord 518 woe unto you that desire the day of the lord to what end is it for you the day of the lord is darkness and not light 519 as if a man did flee from a lion and a bear met him or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall and a serpent bit him 520 shall not the day of the lord be darkness and not light even very dark and no brightness in it 521 i hate i despise your feast days and i will not smell in your solemn assemblies 522 though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings i will not accept them neither will i regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts 523 take thou away from me the noise of thy songs for i will not hear the melody of thy viols 524 but let judgment run down as waters and righteousness as a mighty stream 525 have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years o house of israel 526 but ye have borne the tabernacle of your moloch and chiun your images the star of your god which ye made to yourselves 527 therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus saith the lord whose name is the god of hosts 61 woe to them that are at ease in zion and trust in the mountain of samaria which are named chief of the nations to whom the house of israel came 62 pass ye unto calneh and see and from thence go ye to hamath the great then go down to gath of the philistines be they better than these kingdoms or their border greater than your border 63 ye that put far away the evil day and cause the seat of violence to come near 64 that lie upon beds of ivory and stretch themselves upon their couches and eat the lambs out of the flock and the calves out of the midst of the stall 65 that chant to the sound of the viol and invent to themselves instruments of musick like david 66 that drink wine in bowls and anoint themselves with the chief ointments but they are not grieved for the affliction of joseph 67 therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed 68 the lord god hath sworn by himself saith the lord the god of hosts i abhor the excellency of jacob and hate his palaces therefore will i deliver up the city with all that is therein 69 and it shall come to pass if there remain ten men in one house that they shall die 610 and a mans uncle shall take him up and he that burneth him to bring out the bones out of the house and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house is there yet any with thee and he shall say no then shall he say hold thy tongue for we may not make mention of the name of the lord 611 for behold the lord commandeth and he will smite the great house with breaches and the little house with clefts 612 shall horses run upon the rock will one plow there with oxen for ye have turned judgment into gall and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock 613 ye which rejoice in a thing of nought which say have we not taken to us horns by our own strength 614 but behold i will raise up against you a nation o house of israel saith the lord the god of hosts and they shall afflict you from the entering in of hemath unto the river of the wilderness 71 thus hath the lord god shewed unto me and behold he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth and lo it was the latter growth after the kings mowings 72 and it came to pass that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land then i said o lord god forgive i beseech thee by whom shall jacob arise for he is small 73 the lord repented for this it shall not be saith the lord 74 thus hath the lord god shewed unto me and behold the lord god called to contend by fire and it devoured the great deep and did eat up a part 75 then said i o lord god cease i beseech thee by whom shall jacob arise for he is small 76 the lord repented for this this also shall not be saith the lord god 77 thus he shewed me and behold the lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline with a plumbline in his hand 78 and the lord said unto me amos what seest thou and i said a plumbline then said the lord behold i will set a plumbline in the midst of my people israel i will not again pass by them any more 79 and the high places of isaac shall be desolate and the sanctuaries of israel shall be laid waste and i will rise against the house of jeroboam with the sword 710 then amaziah the priest of bethel sent to jeroboam king of israel saying amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of israel the land is not able to bear all his words 711 for thus amos saith jeroboam shall die by the sword and israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land 712 also amaziah said unto amos o thou seer go flee thee away into the land of judah and there eat bread and prophesy there 713 but prophesy not again any more at bethel for it is the kings chapel and it is the kings court 714 then answered amos and said to amaziah i was no prophet neither was i a prophets son but i was an herdman and a gatherer of sycomore fruit 715 and the lord took me as i followed the flock and the lord said unto me go prophesy unto my people israel 716 now therefore hear thou the word of the lord thou sayest prophesy not against israel and drop not thy word against the house of isaac 717 therefore thus saith the lord thy wife shall be an harlot in the city and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword and thy land shall be divided by line and thou shalt die in a polluted land and israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land 81 thus hath the lord god shewed unto me and behold a basket of summer fruit 82 and he said amos what seest thou and i said a basket of summer fruit then said the lord unto me the end is come upon my people of israel i will not again pass by them any more 83 and the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day saith the lord god there shall be many dead bodies in every place they shall cast them forth with silence 84 hear this o ye that swallow up the needy even to make the poor of the land to fail 85 saying when will the new moon be gone that we may sell corn and the sabbath that we may set forth wheat making the ephah small and the shekel great and falsifying the balances by deceit 86 that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes yea and sell the refuse of the wheat 87 the lord hath sworn by the excellency of jacob surely i will never forget any of their works 88 shall not the land tremble for this and every one mourn that dwelleth therein and it shall rise up wholly as a flood and it shall be cast out and drowned as by the flood of egypt 89 and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord god that i will cause the sun to go down at noon and i will darken the earth in the clear day 810 and i will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation and i will bring up sackcloth upon all loins and baldness upon every head and i will make it as the mourning of an only son and the end thereof as a bitter day 811 behold the days come saith the lord god that i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of hearing the words of the lord 812 and they shall wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the lord and shall not find it 813 in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst 814 they that swear by the sin of samaria and say thy god o dan liveth and the manner of beersheba liveth even they shall fall and never rise up again 91 i saw the lord standing upon the altar and he said smite the lintel of the door that the posts may shake and cut them in the head all of them and i will slay the last of them with the sword he that fleeth of them shall not flee away and he that escapeth of them shall not be delivered 92 though they dig into hell thence shall mine hand take them though they climb up to heaven thence will i bring them down 93 and though they hide themselves in the top of carmel i will search and take them out thence and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea thence will i command the serpent and he shall bite them 94 and though they go into captivity before their enemies thence will i command the sword and it shall slay them and i will set mine eyes upon them for evil and not for good 95 and the lord god of hosts is he that toucheth the land and it shall melt and all that dwell therein shall mourn and it shall rise up wholly like a flood and shall be drowned as by the flood of egypt 96 it is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven and hath founded his troop in the earth he that calleth for the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face of the earth the lord is his name 97 are ye not as children of the ethiopians unto me o children of israel saith the lord have not i brought up israel out of the land of egypt and the philistines from caphtor and the syrians from kir 98 behold the eyes of the lord god are upon the sinful kingdom and i will destroy it from off the face of the earth saving that i will not utterly destroy the house of jacob saith the lord 99 for lo i will command and i will sift the house of israel among all nations like as corn is sifted in a sieve yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth 910 all the sinners of my people shall die by the sword which say the evil shall not overtake nor prevent us 911 in that day will i raise up the tabernacle of david that is fallen and close up the breaches thereof and i will raise up his ruins and i will build it as in the days of old 912 that they may possess the remnant of edom and of all the heathen which are called by my name saith the lord that doeth this 913 behold the days come saith the lord that the plowman shall overtake the reaper and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed and the mountains shall drop sweet wine and all the hills shall melt 914 and i will bring again the captivity of my people of israel and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof they shall also make gardens and eat the fruit of them 915 and i will plant them upon their land and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which i have given them saith the lord thy god obadiah 11 the vision of obadiah thus saith the lord god concerning edom we have heard a rumour from the lord and an ambassador is sent among the heathen arise ye and let us rise up against her in battle 12 behold i have made thee small among the heathen thou art greatly despised 13 the pride of thine heart hath deceived thee thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock whose habitation is high that saith in his heart who shall bring me down to the ground 14 though thou exalt thyself as the eagle and though thou set thy nest among the stars thence will i bring thee down saith the lord 15 if thieves came to thee if robbers by night how art thou cut off would they not have stolen till they had enough if the grapegatherers came to thee would they not leave some grapes 16 how are the things of esau searched out how are his hidden things sought up 17 all the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee and prevailed against thee that they eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee there is none understanding in him 18 shall i not in that day saith the lord even destroy the wise men out of edom and understanding out of the mount of esau 19 and thy mighty men o teman shall be dismayed to the end that every one of the mount of esau may be cut off by slaughter 110 for thy violence against thy brother jacob shame shall cover thee and thou shalt be cut off for ever 111 in the day that thou stoodest on the other side in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces and foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots upon jerusalem even thou wast as one of them 112 but thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger neither shouldest thou have rejoiced over the children of judah in the day of their destruction neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress 113 thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity yea thou shouldest not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity 114 neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway to cut off those of his that did escape neither shouldest thou have delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of distress 115 for the day of the lord is near upon all the heathen as thou hast done it shall be done unto thee thy reward shall return upon thine own head 116 for as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain so shall all the heathen drink continually yea they shall drink and they shall swallow down and they shall be as though they had not been 117 but upon mount zion shall be deliverance and there shall be holiness and the house of jacob shall possess their possessions 118 and the house of jacob shall be a fire and the house of joseph a flame and the house of esau for stubble and they shall kindle in them and devour them and there shall not be any remaining of the house of esau for the lord hath spoken it 119 and they of the south shall possess the mount of esau and they of the plain the philistines and they shall possess the fields of ephraim and the fields of samaria and benjamin shall possess gilead 120 and the captivity of this host of the children of israel shall possess that of the canaanites even unto zarephath and the captivity of jerusalem which is in sepharad shall possess the cities of the south 121 and saviours shall come up on mount zion to judge the mount of esau and the kingdom shall be the lords jonah 11 now the word of the lord came unto jonah the son of amittai saying 12 arise go to nineveh that great city and cry against it for their wickedness is come up before me 13 but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord and went down to joppa and he found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the lord 14 but the lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken 15 then the mariners were afraid and cried every man unto his god and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea to lighten it of them but jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship and he lay and was fast asleep 16 so the shipmaster came to him and said unto him what meanest thou o sleeper arise call upon thy god if so be that god will think upon us that we perish not 17 and they said every one to his fellow come and let us cast lots that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us so they cast lots and the lot fell upon jonah 18 then said they unto him tell us we pray thee for whose cause this evil is upon us what is thine occupation and whence comest thou what is thy country and of what people art thou 19 and he said unto them i am an hebrew and i fear the lord the god of heaven which hath made the sea and the dry land 110 then were the men exceedingly afraid and said unto him why hast thou done this for the men knew that he fled from the presence of the lord because he had told them 111 then said they unto him what shall we do unto thee that the sea may be calm unto us for the sea wrought and was tempestuous 112 and he said unto them take me up and cast me forth into the sea so shall the sea be calm unto you for i know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you 113 nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land but they could not for the sea wrought and was tempestuous against them 114 wherefore they cried unto the lord and said we beseech thee o lord we beseech thee let us not perish for this mans life and lay not upon us innocent blood for thou o lord hast done as it pleased thee 115 so they look up jonah and cast him forth into the sea and the sea ceased from her raging 116 then the men feared the lord exceedingly and offered a sacrifice unto the lord and made vows 117 now the lord had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah and jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights 21 then jonah prayed unto the lord his god out of the fishs belly 22 and said i cried by reason of mine affliction unto the lord and he heard me out of the belly of hell cried i and thou heardest my voice 23 for thou hadst cast me into the deep in the midst of the seas and the floods compassed me about all thy billows and thy waves passed over me 24 then i said i am cast out of thy sight yet i will look again toward thy holy temple 25 the waters compassed me about even to the soul the depth closed me round about the weeds were wrapped about my head 26 i went down to the bottoms of the mountains the earth with her bars was about me for ever yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption o lord my god 27 when my soul fainted within me i remembered the lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thine holy temple 28 they that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy 29 but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving i will pay that that i have vowed salvation is of the lord 210 and the lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out jonah upon the dry land 31 and the word of the lord came unto jonah the second time saying 32 arise go unto nineveh that great city and preach unto it the preaching that i bid thee 33 so jonah arose and went unto nineveh according to the word of the lord now nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey 34 and jonah began to enter into the city a days journey and he cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown 35 so the people of nineveh believed god and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least of them 36 for word came unto the king of nineveh and he arose from his throne and he laid his robe from him and covered him with sackcloth and sat in ashes 37 and he caused it to be proclaimed and published through nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles saying let neither man nor beast herd nor flock taste any thing let them not feed nor drink water 38 but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands 39 who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not 310 and god saw their works that they turned from their evil way and god repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them and he did it not 41 but it displeased jonah exceedingly and he was very angry 42 and he prayed unto the lord and said i pray thee o lord was not this my saying when i was yet in my country therefore i fled before unto tarshish for i knew that thou art a gracious god and merciful slow to anger and of great kindness and repentest thee of the evil 43 therefore now o lord take i beseech thee my life from me for it is better for me to die than to live 44 then said the lord doest thou well to be angry 45 so jonah went out of the city and sat on the east side of the city and there made him a booth and sat under it in the shadow till he might see what would become of the city 46 and the lord god prepared a gourd and made it to come up over jonah that it might be a shadow over his head to deliver him from his grief so jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd 47 but god prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day and it smote the gourd that it withered 48 and it came to pass when the sun did arise that god prepared a vehement east wind and the sun beat upon the head of jonah that he fainted and wished in himself to die and said it is better for me to die than to live 49 and god said to jonah doest thou well to be angry for the gourd and he said i do well to be angry even unto death 410 then said the lord thou hast had pity on the gourd for the which thou hast not laboured neither madest it grow which came up in a night and perished in a night 411 and should not i spare nineveh that great city wherein are more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand and also much cattle micah 11 the word of the lord that came to micah the morasthite in the days of jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah which he saw concerning samaria and jerusalem 12 hear all ye people hearken o earth and all that therein is and let the lord god be witness against you the lord from his holy temple 13 for behold the lord cometh forth out of his place and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth 14 and the mountains shall be molten under him and the valleys shall be cleft as wax before the fire and as the waters that are poured down a steep place 15 for the transgression of jacob is all this and for the sins of the house of israel what is the transgression of jacob is it not samaria and what are the high places of judah are they not jerusalem 16 therefore i will make samaria as an heap of the field and as plantings of a vineyard and i will pour down the stones thereof into the valley and i will discover the foundations thereof 17 and all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire and all the idols thereof will i lay desolate for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot and they shall return to the hire of an harlot 18 therefore i will wail and howl i will go stripped and naked i will make a wailing like the dragons and mourning as the owls 19 for her wound is incurable for it is come unto judah he is come unto the gate of my people even to jerusalem 110 declare ye it not at gath weep ye not at all in the house of aphrah roll thyself in the dust 111 pass ye away thou inhabitant of saphir having thy shame naked the inhabitant of zaanan came not forth in the mourning of bethezel he shall receive of you his standing 112 for the inhabitant of maroth waited carefully for good but evil came down from the lord unto the gate of jerusalem 113 o thou inhabitant of lachish bind the chariot to the swift beast she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of zion for the transgressions of israel were found in thee 114 therefore shalt thou give presents to moreshethgath the houses of achzib shall be a lie to the kings of israel 115 yet will i bring an heir unto thee o inhabitant of mareshah he shall come unto adullam the glory of israel 116 make thee bald and poll thee for thy delicate children enlarge thy baldness as the eagle for they are gone into captivity from thee 21 woe to them that devise iniquity and work evil upon their beds when the morning is light they practise it because it is in the power of their hand 22 and they covet fields and take them by violence and houses and take them away so they oppress a man and his house even a man and his heritage 23 therefore thus saith the lord behold against this family do i devise an evil from which ye shall not remove your necks neither shall ye go haughtily for this time is evil 24 in that day shall one take up a parable against you and lament with a doleful lamentation and say we be utterly spoiled he hath changed the portion of my people how hath he removed it from me turning away he hath divided our fields 25 therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the lord 26 prophesy ye not say they to them that prophesy they shall not prophesy to them that they shall not take shame 27 o thou that art named the house of jacob is the spirit of the lord straitened are these his doings do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly 28 even of late my people is risen up as an enemy ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war 29 the women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever 210 arise ye and depart for this is not your rest because it is polluted it shall destroy you even with a sore destruction 211 if a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie saying i will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink he shall even be the prophet of this people 212 i will surely assemble o jacob all of thee i will surely gather the remnant of israel i will put them together as the sheep of bozrah as the flock in the midst of their fold they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men 213 the breaker is come up before them they have broken up and have passed through the gate and are gone out by it and their king shall pass before them and the lord on the head of them 31 and i said hear i pray you o heads of jacob and ye princes of the house of israel is it not for you to know judgment 32 who hate the good and love the evil who pluck off their skin from off them and their flesh from off their bones 33 who also eat the flesh of my people and flay their skin from off them and they break their bones and chop them in pieces as for the pot and as flesh within the caldron 34 then shall they cry unto the lord but he will not hear them he will even hide his face from them at that time as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings 35 thus saith the lord concerning the prophets that make my people err that bite with their teeth and cry peace and he that putteth not into their mouths they even prepare war against him 36 therefore night shall be unto you that ye shall not have a vision and it shall be dark unto you that ye shall not divine and the sun shall go down over the prophets and the day shall be dark over them 37 then shall the seers be ashamed and the diviners confounded yea they shall all cover their lips for there is no answer of god 38 but truly i am full of power by the spirit of the lord and of judgment and of might to declare unto jacob his transgression and to israel his sin 39 hear this i pray you ye heads of the house of jacob and princes of the house of israel that abhor judgment and pervert all equity 310 they build up zion with blood and jerusalem with iniquity 311 the heads thereof judge for reward and the priests thereof teach for hire and the prophets thereof divine for money yet will they lean upon the lord and say is not the lord among us none evil can come upon us 312 therefore shall zion for your sake be plowed as a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest 41 but in the last days it shall come to pass that the mountain of the house of the lord shall be established in the top of the mountains and it shall be exalted above the hills and people shall flow unto it 42 and many nations shall come and say come and let us go up to the mountain of the lord and to the house of the god of jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his paths for the law shall go forth of zion and the word of the lord from jerusalem 43 and he shall judge among many people and rebuke strong nations afar off and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks nation shall not lift up a sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more 44 but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree and none shall make them afraid for the mouth of the lord of hosts hath spoken it 45 for all people will walk every one in the name of his god and we will walk in the name of the lord our god for ever and ever 46 in that day saith the lord will i assemble her that halteth and i will gather her that is driven out and her that i have afflicted 47 and i will make her that halted a remnant and her that was cast far off a strong nation and the lord shall reign over them in mount zion from henceforth even for ever 48 and thou o tower of the flock the strong hold of the daughter of zion unto thee shall it come even the first dominion the kingdom shall come to the daughter of jerusalem 49 now why dost thou cry out aloud is there no king in thee is thy counsellor perished for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail 410 be in pain and labour to bring forth o daughter of zion like a woman in travail for now shalt thou go forth out of the city and thou shalt dwell in the field and thou shalt go even to babylon there shalt thou be delivered there the lord shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies 411 now also many nations are gathered against thee that say let her be defiled and let our eye look upon zion 412 but they know not the thoughts of the lord neither understand they his counsel for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor 413 arise and thresh o daughter of zion for i will make thine horn iron and i will make thy hoofs brass and thou shalt beat in pieces many people and i will consecrate their gain unto the lord and their substance unto the lord of the whole earth 51 now gather thyself in troops o daughter of troops he hath laid siege against us they shall smite the judge of israel with a rod upon the cheek 52 but thou bethlehem ephratah though thou be little among the thousands of judah yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from of old from everlasting 53 therefore will he give them up until the time that she which travaileth hath brought forth then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of israel 54 and he shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord in the majesty of the name of the lord his god and they shall abide for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth 55 and this man shall be the peace when the assyrian shall come into our land and when he shall tread in our palaces then shall we raise against him seven shepherds and eight principal men 56 and they shall waste the land of assyria with the sword and the land of nimrod in the entrances thereof thus shall he deliver us from the assyrian when he cometh into our land and when he treadeth within our borders 57 and the remnant of jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the lord as the showers upon the grass that tarrieth not for man nor waiteth for the sons of men 58 and the remnant of jacob shall be among the gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest as a young lion among the flocks of sheep who if he go through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces and none can deliver 59 thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries and all thine enemies shall be cut off 510 and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord that i will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee and i will destroy thy chariots 511 and i will cut off the cities of thy land and throw down all thy strong holds 512 and i will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand and thou shalt have no more soothsayers 513 thy graven images also will i cut off and thy standing images out of the midst of thee and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands 514 and i will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee so will i destroy thy cities 515 and i will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen such as they have not heard 61 hear ye now what the lord saith arise contend thou before the mountains and let the hills hear thy voice 62 hear ye o mountains the lords controversy and ye strong foundations of the earth for the lord hath a controversy with his people and he will plead with israel 63 o my people what have i done unto thee and wherein have i wearied thee testify against me 64 for i brought thee up out of the land of egypt and redeemed thee out of the house of servants and i sent before thee moses aaron and miriam 65 o my people remember now what balak king of moab consulted and what balaam the son of beor answered him from shittim unto gilgal that ye may know the righteousness of the lord 66 wherewith shall i come before the lord and bow myself before the high god shall i come before him with burnt offerings with calves of a year old 67 will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil shall i give my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul 68 he hath shewed thee o man what is good and what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god 69 the lords voice crieth unto the city and the man of wisdom shall see thy name hear ye the rod and who hath appointed it 610 are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked and the scant measure that is abominable 611 shall i count them pure with the wicked balances and with the bag of deceitful weights 612 for the rich men thereof are full of violence and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth 613 therefore also will i make thee sick in smiting thee in making thee desolate because of thy sins 614 thou shalt eat but not be satisfied and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee and thou shalt take hold but shalt not deliver and that which thou deliverest will i give up to the sword 615 thou shalt sow but thou shalt not reap thou shalt tread the olives but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil and sweet wine but shalt not drink wine 616 for the statutes of omri are kept and all the works of the house of ahab and ye walk in their counsels that i should make thee a desolation and the inhabitants thereof an hissing therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people 71 woe is me for i am as when they have gathered the summer fruits as the grapegleanings of the vintage there is no cluster to eat my soul desired the firstripe fruit 72 the good man is perished out of the earth and there is none upright among men they all lie in wait for blood they hunt every man his brother with a net 73 that they may do evil with both hands earnestly the prince asketh and the judge asketh for a reward and the great man he uttereth his mischievous desire so they wrap it up 74 the best of them is as a brier the most upright is sharper than a thorn hedge the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation cometh now shall be their perplexity 75 trust ye not in a friend put ye not confidence in a guide keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom 76 for the son dishonoureth the father the daughter riseth up against her mother the daughter in law against her mother in law a mans enemies are the men of his own house 77 therefore i will look unto the lord i will wait for the god of my salvation my god will hear me 78 rejoice not against me o mine enemy when i fall i shall arise when i sit in darkness the lord shall be a light unto me 79 i will bear the indignation of the lord because i have sinned against him until he plead my cause and execute judgment for me he will bring me forth to the light and i shall behold his righteousness 710 then she that is mine enemy shall see it and shame shall cover her which said unto me where is the lord thy god mine eyes shall behold her now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets 711 in the day that thy walls are to be built in that day shall the decree be far removed 712 in that day also he shall come even to thee from assyria and from the fortified cities and from the fortress even to the river and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain 713 notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein for the fruit of their doings 714 feed thy people with thy rod the flock of thine heritage which dwell solitarily in the wood in the midst of carmel let them feed in bashan and gilead as in the days of old 715 according to the days of thy coming out of the land of egypt will i shew unto him marvellous things 716 the nations shall see and be confounded at all their might they shall lay their hand upon their mouth their ears shall be deaf 717 they shall lick the dust like a serpent they shall move out of their holes like worms of the earth they shall be afraid of the lord our god and shall fear because of thee 718 who is a god like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage he retaineth not his anger for ever because he delighteth in mercy 719 he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea 720 thou wilt perform the truth to jacob and the mercy to abraham which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old nahum 11 the burden of nineveh the book of the vision of nahum the elkoshite 12 god is jealous and the lord revengeth the lord revengeth and is furious the lord will take vengeance on his adversaries and he reserveth wrath for his enemies 13 the lord is slow to anger and great in power and will not at all acquit the wicked the lord hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm and the clouds are the dust of his feet 14 he rebuketh the sea and maketh it dry and drieth up all the rivers bashan languisheth and carmel and the flower of lebanon languisheth 15 the mountains quake at him and the hills melt and the earth is burned at his presence yea the world and all that dwell therein 16 who can stand before his indignation and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger his fury is poured out like fire and the rocks are thrown down by him 17 the lord is good a strong hold in the day of trouble and he knoweth them that trust in him 18 but with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the place thereof and darkness shall pursue his enemies 19 what do ye imagine against the lord he will make an utter end affliction shall not rise up the second time 110 for while they be folden together as thorns and while they are drunken as drunkards they shall be devoured as stubble fully dry 111 there is one come out of thee that imagineth evil against the lord a wicked counsellor 112 thus saith the lord though they be quiet and likewise many yet thus shall they be cut down when he shall pass through though i have afflicted thee i will afflict thee no more 113 for now will i break his yoke from off thee and will burst thy bonds in sunder 114 and the lord hath given a commandment concerning thee that no more of thy name be sown out of the house of thy gods will i cut off the graven image and the molten image i will make thy grave for thou art vile 115 behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publisheth peace o judah keep thy solemn feasts perform thy vows for the wicked shall no more pass through thee he is utterly cut off 21 he that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face keep the munition watch the way make thy loins strong fortify thy power mightily 22 for the lord hath turned away the excellency of jacob as the excellency of israel for the emptiers have emptied them out and marred their vine branches 23 the shield of his mighty men is made red the valiant men are in scarlet the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken 24 the chariots shall rage in the streets they shall justle one against another in the broad ways they shall seem like torches they shall run like the lightnings 25 he shall recount his worthies they shall stumble in their walk they shall make haste to the wall thereof and the defence shall be prepared 26 the gates of the rivers shall be opened and the palace shall be dissolved 27 and huzzab shall be led away captive she shall be brought up and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves tabering upon their breasts 28 but nineveh is of old like a pool of water yet they shall flee away stand stand shall they cry but none shall look back 29 take ye the spoil of silver take the spoil of gold for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture 210 she is empty and void and waste and the heart melteth and the knees smite together and much pain is in all loins and the faces of them all gather blackness 211 where is the dwelling of the lions and the feedingplace of the young lions where the lion even the old lion walked and the lions whelp and none made them afraid 212 the lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps and strangled for his lionesses and filled his holes with prey and his dens with ravin 213 behold i am against thee saith the lord of hosts and i will burn her chariots in the smoke and the sword shall devour thy young lions and i will cut off thy prey from the earth and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard 31 woe to the bloody city it is all full of lies and robbery the prey departeth not 32 the noise of a whip and the noise of the rattling of the wheels and of the pransing horses and of the jumping chariots 33 the horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the glittering spear and there is a multitude of slain and a great number of carcases and there is none end of their corpses they stumble upon their corpses 34 because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured harlot the mistress of witchcrafts that selleth nations through her whoredoms and families through her witchcrafts 35 behold i am against thee saith the lord of hosts and i will discover thy skirts upon thy face and i will shew the nations thy nakedness and the kingdoms thy shame 36 and i will cast abominable filth upon thee and make thee vile and will set thee as a gazingstock 37 and it shall come to pass that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee and say nineveh is laid waste who will bemoan her whence shall i seek comforters for thee 38 art thou better than populous no that was situate among the rivers that had the waters round about it whose rampart was the sea and her wall was from the sea 39 ethiopia and egypt were her strength and it was infinite put and lubim were thy helpers 310 yet was she carried away she went into captivity her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets and they cast lots for her honourable men and all her great men were bound in chains 311 thou also shalt be drunken thou shalt be hid thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy 312 all thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs if they be shaken they shall even fall into the mouth of the eater 313 behold thy people in the midst of thee are women the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies the fire shall devour thy bars 314 draw thee waters for the siege fortify thy strong holds go into clay and tread the morter make strong the brickkiln 315 there shall the fire devour thee the sword shall cut thee off it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm make thyself many as the cankerworm make thyself many as the locusts 316 thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven the cankerworm spoileth and fleeth away 317 thy crowned are as the locusts and thy captains as the great grasshoppers which camp in the hedges in the cold day but when the sun ariseth they flee away and their place is not known where they are 318 thy shepherds slumber o king of assyria thy nobles shall dwell in the dust thy people is scattered upon the mountains and no man gathereth them 319 there is no healing of thy bruise thy wound is grievous all that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually habakkuk 11 the burden which habakkuk the prophet did see 12 o lord how long shall i cry and thou wilt not hear even cry out unto thee of violence and thou wilt not save 13 why dost thou shew me iniquity and cause me to behold grievance for spoiling and violence are before me and there are that raise up strife and contention 14 therefore the law is slacked and judgment doth never go forth for the wicked doth compass about the righteous therefore wrong judgment proceedeth 15 behold ye among the heathen and regard and wonder marvelously for i will work a work in your days which ye will not believe though it be told you 16 for lo i raise up the chaldeans that bitter and hasty nation which shall march through the breadth of the land to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs 17 they are terrible and dreadful their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves 18 their horses also are swifter than the leopards and are more fierce than the evening wolves and their horsemen shall spread themselves and their horsemen shall come from far they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat 19 they shall come all for violence their faces shall sup up as the east wind and they shall gather the captivity as the sand 110 and they shall scoff at the kings and the princes shall be a scorn unto them they shall deride every strong hold for they shall heap dust and take it 111 then shall his mind change and he shall pass over and offend imputing this his power unto his god 112 art thou not from everlasting o lord my god mine holy one we shall not die o lord thou hast ordained them for judgment and o mighty god thou hast established them for correction 113 thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil and canst not look on iniquity wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he 114 and makest men as the fishes of the sea as the creeping things that have no ruler over them 115 they take up all of them with the angle they catch them in their net and gather them in their drag therefore they rejoice and are glad 116 therefore they sacrifice unto their net and burn incense unto their drag because by them their portion is fat and their meat plenteous 117 shall they therefore empty their net and not spare continually to slay the nations 21 i will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what i shall answer when i am reproved 22 and the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it 23 for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry 24 behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith 25 yea also because he transgresseth by wine he is a proud man neither keepeth at home who enlargeth his desire as hell and is as death and cannot be satisfied but gathereth unto him all nations and heapeth unto him all people 26 shall not all these take up a parable against him and a taunting proverb against him and say woe to him that increaseth that which is not his how long and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay 27 shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee and awake that shall vex thee and thou shalt be for booties unto them 28 because thou hast spoiled many nations all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee because of mens blood and for the violence of the land of the city and of all that dwell therein 29 woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house that he may set his nest on high that he may be delivered from the power of evil 210 thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people and hast sinned against thy soul 211 for the stone shall cry out of the wall and the beam out of the timber shall answer it 212 woe to him that buildeth a town with blood and stablisheth a city by iniquity 213 behold is it not of the lord of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity 214 for the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the lord as the waters cover the sea 215 woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink that puttest thy bottle to him and makest him drunken also that thou mayest look on their nakedness 216 thou art filled with shame for glory drink thou also and let thy foreskin be uncovered the cup of the lords right hand shall be turned unto thee and shameful spewing shall be on thy glory 217 for the violence of lebanon shall cover thee and the spoil of beasts which made them afraid because of mens blood and for the violence of the land of the city and of all that dwell therein 218 what profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it the molten image and a teacher of lies that the maker of his work trusteth therein to make dumb idols 219 woe unto him that saith to the wood awake to the dumb stone arise it shall teach behold it is laid over with gold and silver and there is no breath at all in the midst of it 220 but the lord is in his holy temple let all the earth keep silence before him 31 a prayer of habakkuk the prophet upon shigionoth 32 o lord i have heard thy speech and was afraid o lord revive thy work in the midst of the years in the midst of the years make known in wrath remember mercy 33 god came from teman and the holy one from mount paran selah his glory covered the heavens and the earth was full of his praise 34 and his brightness was as the light he had horns coming out of his hand and there was the hiding of his power 35 before him went the pestilence and burning coals went forth at his feet 36 he stood and measured the earth he beheld and drove asunder the nations and the everlasting mountains were scattered the perpetual hills did bow his ways are everlasting 37 i saw the tents of cushan in affliction and the curtains of the land of midian did tremble 38 was the lord displeased against the rivers was thine anger against the rivers was thy wrath against the sea that thou didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation 39 thy bow was made quite naked according to the oaths of the tribes even thy word selah thou didst cleave the earth with rivers 310 the mountains saw thee and they trembled the overflowing of the water passed by the deep uttered his voice and lifted up his hands on high 311 the sun and moon stood still in their habitation at the light of thine arrows they went and at the shining of thy glittering spear 312 thou didst march through the land in indignation thou didst thresh the heathen in anger 313 thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people even for salvation with thine anointed thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked by discovering the foundation unto the neck selah 314 thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly 315 thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses through the heap of great waters 316 when i heard my belly trembled my lips quivered at the voice rottenness entered into my bones and i trembled in myself that i might rest in the day of trouble when he cometh up unto the people he will invade them with his troops 317 although the fig tree shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines the labour of the olive shall fail and the fields shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the stalls 318 yet i will rejoice in the lord i will joy in the god of my salvation 319 the lord god is my strength and he will make my feet like hinds feet and he will make me to walk upon mine high places to the chief singer on my stringed instruments zephaniah 11 the word of the lord which came unto zephaniah the son of cushi the son of gedaliah the son of amariah the son of hizkiah in the days of josiah the son of amon king of judah 12 i will utterly consume all things from off the land saith the lord 13 i will consume man and beast i will consume the fowls of the heaven and the fishes of the sea and the stumbling blocks with the wicked and i will cut off man from off the land saith the lord 14 i will also stretch out mine hand upon judah and upon all the inhabitants of jerusalem and i will cut off the remnant of baal from this place and the name of the chemarims with the priests 15 and them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops and them that worship and that swear by the lord and that swear by malcham 16 and them that are turned back from the lord and those that have not sought the lord nor enquired for him 17 hold thy peace at the presence of the lord god for the day of the lord is at hand for the lord hath prepared a sacrifice he hath bid his guests 18 and it shall come to pass in the day of the lords sacrifice that i will punish the princes and the kings children and all such as are clothed with strange apparel 19 in the same day also will i punish all those that leap on the threshold which fill their masters houses with violence and deceit 110 and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord that there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate and an howling from the second and a great crashing from the hills 111 howl ye inhabitants of maktesh for all the merchant people are cut down all they that bear silver are cut off 112 and it shall come to pass at that time that i will search jerusalem with candles and punish the men that are settled on their lees that say in their heart the lord will not do good neither will he do evil 113 therefore their goods shall become a booty and their houses a desolation they shall also build houses but not inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards but not drink the wine thereof 114 the great day of the lord is near it is near and hasteth greatly even the voice of the day of the lord the mighty man shall cry there bitterly 115 that day is a day of wrath a day of trouble and distress a day of wasteness and desolation a day of darkness and gloominess a day of clouds and thick darkness 116 a day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities and against the high towers 117 and i will bring distress upon men that they shall walk like blind men because they have sinned against the lord and their blood shall be poured out as dust and their flesh as the dung 118 neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the lords wrath but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealousy for he shall make even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land 21 gather yourselves together yea gather together o nation not desired 22 before the decree bring forth before the day pass as the chaff before the fierce anger of the lord come upon you before the day of the lords anger come upon you 23 seek ye the lord all ye meek of the earth which have wrought his judgment seek righteousness seek meekness it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the lords anger 24 for gaza shall be forsaken and ashkelon a desolation they shall drive out ashdod at the noon day and ekron shall be rooted up 25 woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast the nation of the cherethites the word of the lord is against you o canaan the land of the philistines i will even destroy thee that there shall be no inhabitant 26 and the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for shepherds and folds for flocks 27 and the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of judah they shall feed thereupon in the houses of ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening for the lord their god shall visit them and turn away their captivity 28 i have heard the reproach of moab and the revilings of the children of ammon whereby they have reproached my people and magnified themselves against their border 29 therefore as i live saith the lord of hosts the god of israel surely moab shall be as sodom and the children of ammon as gomorrah even the breeding of nettles and saltpits and a perpetual desolation the residue of my people shall spoil them and the remnant of my people shall possess them 210 this shall they have for their pride because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the lord of hosts 211 the lord will be terrible unto them for he will famish all the gods of the earth and men shall worship him every one from his place even all the isles of the heathen 212 ye ethiopians also ye shall be slain by my sword 213 and he will stretch out his hand against the north and destroy assyria and will make nineveh a desolation and dry like a wilderness 214 and flocks shall lie down in the midst of her all the beasts of the nations both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in the upper lintels of it their voice shall sing in the windows desolation shall be in the thresholds for he shall uncover the cedar work 215 this is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly that said in her heart i am and there is none beside me how is she become a desolation a place for beasts to lie down in every one that passeth by her shall hiss and wag his hand 31 woe to her that is filthy and polluted to the oppressing city 32 she obeyed not the voice she received not correction she trusted not in the lord she drew not near to her god 33 her princes within her are roaring lions her judges are evening wolves they gnaw not the bones till the morrow 34 her prophets are light and treacherous persons her priests have polluted the sanctuary they have done violence to the law 35 the just lord is in the midst thereof he will not do iniquity every morning doth he bring his judgment to light he faileth not but the unjust knoweth no shame 36 i have cut off the nations their towers are desolate i made their streets waste that none passeth by their cities are destroyed so that there is no man that there is none inhabitant 37 i said surely thou wilt fear me thou wilt receive instruction so their dwelling should not be cut off howsoever i punished them but they rose early and corrupted all their doings 38 therefore wait ye upon me saith the lord until the day that i rise up to the prey for my determination is to gather the nations that i may assemble the kingdoms to pour upon them mine indignation even all my fierce anger for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy 39 for then will i turn to the people a pure language that they may all call upon the name of the lord to serve him with one consent 310 from beyond the rivers of ethiopia my suppliants even the daughter of my dispersed shall bring mine offering 311 in that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings wherein thou hast transgressed against me for then i will take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy pride and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy mountain 312 i will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people and they shall trust in the name of the lord 313 the remnant of israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth for they shall feed and lie down and none shall make them afraid 314 sing o daughter of zion shout o israel be glad and rejoice with all the heart o daughter of jerusalem 315 the lord hath taken away thy judgments he hath cast out thine enemy the king of israel even the lord is in the midst of thee thou shalt not see evil any more 316 in that day it shall be said to jerusalem fear thou not and to zion let not thine hands be slack 317 the lord thy god in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will joy over thee with singing 318 i will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly who are of thee to whom the reproach of it was a burden 319 behold at that time i will undo all that afflict thee and i will save her that halteth and gather her that was driven out and i will get them praise and fame in every land where they have been put to shame 320 at that time will i bring you again even in the time that i gather you for i will make you a name and a praise among all people of the earth when i turn back your captivity before your eyes saith the lord haggai 11 in the second year of darius the king in the sixth month in the first day of the month came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet unto zerubbabel the son of shealtiel governor of judah and to joshua the son of josedech the high priest saying 12 thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying this people say the time is not come the time that the lords house should be built 13 then came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet saying 14 is it time for you o ye to dwell in your cieled houses and this house lie waste 15 now therefore thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways 16 ye have sown much and bring in little ye eat but ye have not enough ye drink but ye are not filled with drink ye clothe you but there is none warm and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes 17 thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways 18 go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house and i will take pleasure in it and i will be glorified saith the lord 19 ye looked for much and lo it came to little and when ye brought it home i did blow upon it why saith the lord of hosts because of mine house that is waste and ye run every man unto his own house 110 therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew and the earth is stayed from her fruit 111 and i called for a drought upon the land and upon the mountains and upon the corn and upon the new wine and upon the oil and upon that which the ground bringeth forth and upon men and upon cattle and upon all the labour of the hands 112 then zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and joshua the son of josedech the high priest with all the remnant of the people obeyed the voice of the lord their god and the words of haggai the prophet as the lord their god had sent him and the people did fear before the lord 113 then spake haggai the lords messenger in the lords message unto the people saying i am with you saith the lord 114 and the lord stirred up the spirit of zerubbabel the son of shealtiel governor of judah and the spirit of joshua the son of josedech the high priest and the spirit of all the remnant of the people and they came and did work in the house of the lord of hosts their god 115 in the four and twentieth day of the sixth month in the second year of darius the king 21 in the seventh month in the one and twentieth day of the month came the word of the lord by the prophet haggai saying 22 speak now to zerubbabel the son of shealtiel governor of judah and to joshua the son of josedech the high priest and to the residue of the people saying 23 who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory and how do ye see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing 24 yet now be strong o zerubbabel saith the lord and be strong o joshua son of josedech the high priest and be strong all ye people of the land saith the lord and work for i am with you saith the lord of hosts 25 according to the word that i covenanted with you when ye came out of egypt so my spirit remaineth among you fear ye not 26 for thus saith the lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and i will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land 27 and i will shake all nations and the desire of all nations shall come and i will fill this house with glory saith the lord of hosts 28 the silver is mine and the gold is mine saith the lord of hosts 29 the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former saith the lord of hosts and in this place will i give peace saith the lord of hosts 210 in the four and twentieth day of the ninth month in the second year of darius came the word of the lord by haggai the prophet saying 211 thus saith the lord of hosts ask now the priests concerning the law saying 212 if one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment and with his skirt do touch bread or pottage or wine or oil or any meat shall it be holy and the priests answered and said no 213 then said haggai if one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these shall it be unclean and the priests answered and said it shall be unclean 214 then answered haggai and said so is this people and so is this nation before me saith the lord and so is every work of their hands and that which they offer there is unclean 215 and now i pray you consider from this day and upward from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the lord 216 since those days were when one came to an heap of twenty measures there were but ten when one came to the pressfat for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press there were but twenty 217 i smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands yet ye turned not to me saith the lord 218 consider now from this day and upward from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month even from the day that the foundation of the lords temple was laid consider it 219 is the seed yet in the barn yea as yet the vine and the fig tree and the pomegranate and the olive tree hath not brought forth from this day will i bless you 220 and again the word of the lord came unto haggai in the four and twentieth day of the month saying 221 speak to zerubbabel governor of judah saying i will shake the heavens and the earth 222 and i will overthrow the throne of kingdoms and i will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen and i will overthrow the chariots and those that ride in them and the horses and their riders shall come down every one by the sword of his brother 223 in that day saith the lord of hosts will i take thee o zerubbabel my servant the son of shealtiel saith the lord and will make thee as a signet for i have chosen thee saith the lord of hosts zechariah 11 in the eighth month in the second year of darius came the word of the lord unto zechariah the son of berechiah the son of iddo the prophet saying 12 the lord hath been sore displeased with your fathers 13 therefore say thou unto them thus saith the lord of hosts turn ye unto me saith the lord of hosts and i will turn unto you saith the lord of hosts 14 be ye not as your fathers unto whom the former prophets have cried saying thus saith the lord of hosts turn ye now from your evil ways and from your evil doings but they did not hear nor hearken unto me saith the lord 15 your fathers where are they and the prophets do they live for ever 16 but my words and my statutes which i commanded my servants the prophets did they not take hold of your fathers and they returned and said like as the lord of hosts thought to do unto us according to our ways and according to our doings so hath he dealt with us 17 upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month which is the month sebat in the second year of darius came the word of the lord unto zechariah the son of berechiah the son of iddo the prophet saying 18 i saw by night and behold a man riding upon a red horse and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom and behind him were there red horses speckled and white 19 then said i o my lord what are these and the angel that talked with me said unto me i will shew thee what these be 110 and the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said these are they whom the lord hath sent to walk to and fro through the earth 111 and they answered the angel of the lord that stood among the myrtle trees and said we have walked to and fro through the earth and behold all the earth sitteth still and is at rest 112 then the angel of the lord answered and said o lord of hosts how long wilt thou not have mercy on jerusalem and on the cities of judah against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years 113 and the lord answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words 114 so the angel that communed with me said unto me cry thou saying thus saith the lord of hosts i am jealous for jerusalem and for zion with a great jealousy 115 and i am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease for i was but a little displeased and they helped forward the affliction 116 therefore thus saith the lord i am returned to jerusalem with mercies my house shall be built in it saith the lord of hosts and a line shall be stretched forth upon jerusalem 117 cry yet saying thus saith the lord of hosts my cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad and the lord shall yet comfort zion and shall yet choose jerusalem 118 then lifted i up mine eyes and saw and behold four horns 119 and i said unto the angel that talked with me what be these and he answered me these are the horns which have scattered judah israel and jerusalem 120 and the lord shewed me four carpenters 121 then said i what come these to do and he spake saying these are the horns which have scattered judah so that no man did lift up his head but these are come to fray them to cast out the horns of the gentiles which lifted up their horn over the land of judah to scatter it 21 i lifted up mine eyes again and looked and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand 22 then said i whither goest thou and he said unto me to measure jerusalem to see what is the breadth thereof and what is the length thereof 23 and behold the angel that talked with me went forth and another angel went out to meet him 24 and said unto him run speak to this young man saying jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein 25 for i saith the lord will be unto her a wall of fire round about and will be the glory in the midst of her 26 ho ho come forth and flee from the land of the north saith the lord for i have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven saith the lord 27 deliver thyself o zion that dwellest with the daughter of babylon 28 for thus saith the lord of hosts after the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye 29 for behold i will shake mine hand upon them and they shall be a spoil to their servants and ye shall know that the lord of hosts hath sent me 210 sing and rejoice o daughter of zion for lo i come and i will dwell in the midst of thee saith the lord 211 and many nations shall be joined to the lord in that day and shall be my people and i will dwell in the midst of thee and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee 212 and the lord shall inherit judah his portion in the holy land and shall choose jerusalem again 213 be silent o all flesh before the lord for he is raised up out of his holy habitation 31 and he shewed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the lord and satan standing at his right hand to resist him 32 and the lord said unto satan the lord rebuke thee o satan even the lord that hath chosen jerusalem rebuke thee is not this a brand plucked out of the fire 33 now joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel 34 and he answered and spake unto those that stood before him saying take away the filthy garments from him and unto him he said behold i have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee and i will clothe thee with change of raiment 35 and i said let them set a fair mitre upon his head so they set a fair mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments and the angel of the lord stood by 36 and the angel of the lord protested unto joshua saying 37 thus saith the lord of hosts if thou wilt walk in my ways and if thou wilt keep my charge then thou shalt also judge my house and shalt also keep my courts and i will give thee places to walk among these that stand by 38 hear now o joshua the high priest thou and thy fellows that sit before thee for they are men wondered at for behold i will bring forth my servant the branch 39 for behold the stone that i have laid before joshua upon one stone shall be seven eyes behold i will engrave the graving thereof saith the lord of hosts and i will remove the iniquity of that land in one day 310 in that day saith the lord of hosts shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree 41 and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep 42 and said unto me what seest thou and i said i have looked and behold a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof 43 and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof 44 so i answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my lord 45 then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me knowest thou not what these be and i said no my lord 46 then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the lord unto zerubbabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts 47 who art thou o great mountain before zerubbabel thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it 48 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying 49 the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto you 410 for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the lord which run to and fro through the whole earth 411 then answered i and said unto him what are these two olive trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side thereof 412 and i answered again and said unto him what be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves 413 and he answered me and said knowest thou not what these be and i said no my lord 414 then said he these are the two anointed ones that stand by the lord of the whole earth 51 then i turned and lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold a flying roll 52 and he said unto me what seest thou and i answered i see a flying roll the length thereof is twenty cubits and the breadth thereof ten cubits 53 then said he unto me this is the curse that goeth forth over the face of the whole earth for every one that stealeth shall be cut off as on this side according to it and every one that sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it 54 i will bring it forth saith the lord of hosts and it shall enter into the house of the thief and into the house of him that sweareth falsely by my name and it shall remain in the midst of his house and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof 55 then the angel that talked with me went forth and said unto me lift up now thine eyes and see what is this that goeth forth 56 and i said what is it and he said this is an ephah that goeth forth he said moreover this is their resemblance through all the earth 57 and behold there was lifted up a talent of lead and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah 58 and he said this is wickedness and he cast it into the midst of the ephah and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof 59 then lifted i up mine eyes and looked and behold there came out two women and the wind was in their wings for they had wings like the wings of a stork and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven 510 then said i to the angel that talked with me whither do these bear the ephah 511 and he said unto me to build it an house in the land of shinar and it shall be established and set there upon her own base 61 and i turned and lifted up mine eyes and looked and behold there came four chariots out from between two mountains and the mountains were mountains of brass 62 in the first chariot were red horses and in the second chariot black horses 63 and in the third chariot white horses and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses 64 then i answered and said unto the angel that talked with me what are these my lord 65 and the angel answered and said unto me these are the four spirits of the heavens which go forth from standing before the lord of all the earth 66 the black horses which are therein go forth into the north country and the white go forth after them and the grisled go forth toward the south country 67 and the bay went forth and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth and he said get you hence walk to and fro through the earth so they walked to and fro through the earth 68 then cried he upon me and spake unto me saying behold these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country 69 and the word of the lord came unto me saying 610 take of them of the captivity even of heldai of tobijah and of jedaiah which are come from babylon and come thou the same day and go into the house of josiah the son of zephaniah 611 then take silver and gold and make crowns and set them upon the head of joshua the son of josedech the high priest 612 and speak unto him saying thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying behold the man whose name is the branch and he shall grow up out of his place and he shall build the temple of the lord 613 even he shall build the temple of the lord and he shall bear the glory and shall sit and rule upon his throne and he shall be a priest upon his throne and the counsel of peace shall be between them both 614 and the crowns shall be to helem and to tobijah and to jedaiah and to hen the son of zephaniah for a memorial in the temple of the lord 615 and they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the lord and ye shall know that the lord of hosts hath sent me unto you and this shall come to pass if ye will diligently obey the voice of the lord your god 71 and it came to pass in the fourth year of king darius that the word of the lord came unto zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month even in chisleu 72 when they had sent unto the house of god sherezer and regemmelech and their men to pray before the lord 73 and to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the lord of hosts and to the prophets saying should i weep in the fifth month separating myself as i have done these so many years 74 then came the word of the lord of hosts unto me saying 75 speak unto all the people of the land and to the priests saying when ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month even those seventy years did ye at all fast unto me even to me 76 and when ye did eat and when ye did drink did not ye eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves 77 should ye not hear the words which the lord hath cried by the former prophets when jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity and the cities thereof round about her when men inhabited the south and the plain 78 and the word of the lord came unto zechariah saying 79 thus speaketh the lord of hosts saying execute true judgment and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother 710 and oppress not the widow nor the fatherless the stranger nor the poor and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart 711 but they refused to hearken and pulled away the shoulder and stopped their ears that they should not hear 712 yea they made their hearts as an adamant stone lest they should hear the law and the words which the lord of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets therefore came a great wrath from the lord of hosts 713 therefore it is come to pass that as he cried and they would not hear so they cried and i would not hear saith the lord of hosts 714 but i scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not thus the land was desolate after them that no man passed through nor returned for they laid the pleasant land desolate 81 again the word of the lord of hosts came to me saying 82 thus saith the lord of hosts i was jealous for zion with great jealousy and i was jealous for her with great fury 83 thus saith the lord i am returned unto zion and will dwell in the midst of jerusalem and jerusalem shall be called a city of truth and the mountain of the lord of hosts the holy mountain 84 thus saith the lord of hosts there shall yet old men and old women dwell in the streets of jerusalem and every man with his staff in his hand for very age 85 and the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the streets thereof 86 thus saith the lord of hosts if it be marvellous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days should it also be marvellous in mine eyes saith the lord of hosts 87 thus saith the lord of hosts behold i will save my people from the east country and from the west country 88 and i will bring them and they shall dwell in the midst of jerusalem and they shall be my people and i will be their god in truth and in righteousness 89 thus saith the lord of hosts let your hands be strong ye that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the prophets which were in the day that the foundation of the house of the lord of hosts was laid that the temple might be built 810 for before these days there was no hire for man nor any hire for beast neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction for i set all men every one against his neighbour 811 but now i will not be unto the residue of this people as in the former days saith the lord of hosts 812 for the seed shall be prosperous the vine shall give her fruit and the ground shall give her increase and the heavens shall give their dew and i will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things 813 and it shall come to pass that as ye were a curse among the heathen o house of judah and house of israel so will i save you and ye shall be a blessing fear not but let your hands be strong 814 for thus saith the lord of hosts as i thought to punish you when your fathers provoked me to wrath saith the lord of hosts and i repented not 815 so again have i thought in these days to do well unto jerusalem and to the house of judah fear ye not 816 these are the things that ye shall do speak ye every man the truth to his neighbour execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates 817 and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour and love no false oath for all these are things that i hate saith the lord 818 and the word of the lord of hosts came unto me saying 819 thus saith the lord of hosts the fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of judah joy and gladness and cheerful feasts therefore love the truth and peace 820 thus saith the lord of hosts it shall yet come to pass that there shall come people and the inhabitants of many cities 821 and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another saying let us go speedily to pray before the lord and to seek the lord of hosts i will go also 822 yea many people and strong nations shall come to seek the lord of hosts in jerusalem and to pray before the lord 823 thus saith the lord of hosts in those days it shall come to pass that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a jew saying we will go with you for we have heard that god is with you 91 the burden of the word of the lord in the land of hadrach and damascus shall be the rest thereof when the eyes of man as of all the tribes of israel shall be toward the lord 92 and hamath also shall border thereby tyrus and zidon though it be very wise 93 and tyrus did build herself a strong hold and heaped up silver as the dust and fine gold as the mire of the streets 94 behold the lord will cast her out and he will smite her power in the sea and she shall be devoured with fire 95 ashkelon shall see it and fear gaza also shall see it and be very sorrowful and ekron for her expectation shall be ashamed and the king shall perish from gaza and ashkelon shall not be inhabited 96 and a bastard shall dwell in ashdod and i will cut off the pride of the philistines 97 and i will take away his blood out of his mouth and his abominations from between his teeth but he that remaineth even he shall be for our god and he shall be as a governor in judah and ekron as a jebusite 98 and i will encamp about mine house because of the army because of him that passeth by and because of him that returneth and no oppressor shall pass through them any more for now have i seen with mine eyes 99 rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a colt the foal of an ass 910 and i will cut off the chariot from ephraim and the horse from jerusalem and the battle bow shall be cut off and he shall speak peace unto the heathen and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea and from the river even to the ends of the earth 911 as for thee also by the blood of thy covenant i have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water 912 turn you to the strong hold ye prisoners of hope even to day do i declare that i will render double unto thee 913 when i have bent judah for me filled the bow with ephraim and raised up thy sons o zion against thy sons o greece and made thee as the sword of a mighty man 914 and the lord shall be seen over them and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning and the lord god shall blow the trumpet and shall go with whirlwinds of the south 915 the lord of hosts shall defend them and they shall devour and subdue with sling stones and they shall drink and make a noise as through wine and they shall be filled like bowls and as the corners of the altar 916 and the lord their god shall save them in that day as the flock of his people for they shall be as the stones of a crown lifted up as an ensign upon his land 917 for how great is his goodness and how great is his beauty corn shall make the young men cheerful and new wine the maids 101 ask ye of the lord rain in the time of the latter rain so the lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to every one grass in the field 102 for the idols have spoken vanity and the diviners have seen a lie and have told false dreams they comfort in vain therefore they went their way as a flock they were troubled because there was no shepherd 103 mine anger was kindled against the shepherds and i punished the goats for the lord of hosts hath visited his flock the house of judah and hath made them as his goodly horse in the battle 104 out of him came forth the corner out of him the nail out of him the battle bow out of him every oppressor together 105 and they shall be as mighty men which tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle and they shall fight because the lord is with them and the riders on horses shall be confounded 106 and i will strengthen the house of judah and i will save the house of joseph and i will bring them again to place them for i have mercy upon them and they shall be as though i had not cast them off for i am the lord their god and will hear them 107 and they of ephraim shall be like a mighty man and their heart shall rejoice as through wine yea their children shall see it and be glad their heart shall rejoice in the lord 108 i will hiss for them and gather them for i have redeemed them and they shall increase as they have increased 109 and i will sow them among the people and they shall remember me in far countries and they shall live with their children and turn again 1010 i will bring them again also out of the land of egypt and gather them out of assyria and i will bring them into the land of gilead and lebanon and place shall not be found for them 1011 and he shall pass through the sea with affliction and shall smite the waves in the sea and all the deeps of the river shall dry up and the pride of assyria shall be brought down and the sceptre of egypt shall depart away 1012 and i will strengthen them in the lord and they shall walk up and down in his name saith the lord 111 open thy doors o lebanon that the fire may devour thy cedars 112 howl fir tree for the cedar is fallen because the mighty are spoiled howl o ye oaks of bashan for the forest of the vintage is come down 113 there is a voice of the howling of the shepherds for their glory is spoiled a voice of the roaring of young lions for the pride of jordan is spoiled 114 thus saith the lord my god feed the flock of the slaughter 115 whose possessors slay them and hold themselves not guilty and they that sell them say blessed be the lord for i am rich and their own shepherds pity them not 116 for i will no more pity the inhabitants of the land saith the lord but lo i will deliver the men every one into his neighbours hand and into the hand of his king and they shall smite the land and out of their hand i will not deliver them 117 and i will feed the flock of slaughter even you o poor of the flock and i took unto me two staves the one i called beauty and the other i called bands and i fed the flock 118 three shepherds also i cut off in one month and my soul lothed them and their soul also abhorred me 119 then said i i will not feed you that that dieth let it die and that that is to be cut off let it be cut off and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another 1110 and i took my staff even beauty and cut it asunder that i might break my covenant which i had made with all the people 1111 and it was broken in that day and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the lord 1112 and i said unto them if ye think good give me my price and if not forbear so they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver 1113 and the lord said unto me cast it unto the potter a goodly price that i was prised at of them and i took the thirty pieces of silver and cast them to the potter in the house of the lord 1114 then i cut asunder mine other staff even bands that i might break the brotherhood between judah and israel 1115 and the lord said unto me take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd 1116 for lo i will raise up a shepherd in the land which shall not visit those that be cut off neither shall seek the young one nor heal that that is broken nor feed that that standeth still but he shall eat the flesh of the fat and tear their claws in pieces 1117 woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock the sword shall be upon his arm and upon his right eye his arm shall be clean dried up and his right eye shall be utterly darkened 121 the burden of the word of the lord for israel saith the lord which stretcheth forth the heavens and layeth the foundation of the earth and formeth the spirit of man within him 122 behold i will make jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about when they shall be in the siege both against judah and against jerusalem 123 and in that day will i make jerusalem a burdensome stone for all people all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it 124 in that day saith the lord i will smite every horse with astonishment and his rider with madness and i will open mine eyes upon the house of judah and will smite every horse of the people with blindness 125 and the governors of judah shall say in their heart the inhabitants of jerusalem shall be my strength in the lord of hosts their god 126 in that day will i make the governors of judah like an hearth of fire among the wood and like a torch of fire in a sheaf and they shall devour all the people round about on the right hand and on the left and jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place even in jerusalem 127 the lord also shall save the tents of judah first that the glory of the house of david and the glory of the inhabitants of jerusalem do not magnify themselves against judah 128 in that day shall the lord defend the inhabitants of jerusalem and he that is feeble among them at that day shall be as david and the house of david shall be as god as the angel of the lord before them 129 and it shall come to pass in that day that i will seek to destroy all the nations that come against jerusalem 1210 and i will pour upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn 1211 in that day shall there be a great mourning in jerusalem as the mourning of hadadrimmon in the valley of megiddon 1212 and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the house of david apart and their wives apart the family of the house of nathan apart and their wives apart 1213 the family of the house of levi apart and their wives apart the family of shimei apart and their wives apart 1214 all the families that remain every family apart and their wives apart 131 in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness 132 and it shall come to pass in that day saith the lord of hosts that i will cut off the names of the idols out of the land and they shall no more be remembered and also i will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land 133 and it shall come to pass that when any shall yet prophesy then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him thou shalt not live for thou speakest lies in the name of the lord and his father and his mother that begat him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth 134 and it shall come to pass in that day that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision when he hath prophesied neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive 135 but he shall say i am no prophet i am an husbandman for man taught me to keep cattle from my youth 136 and one shall say unto him what are these wounds in thine hands then he shall answer those with which i was wounded in the house of my friends 137 awake o sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow saith the lord of hosts smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered and i will turn mine hand upon the little ones 138 and it shall come to pass that in all the land saith the lord two parts therein shall be cut off and die but the third shall be left therein 139 and i will bring the third part through the fire and will refine them as silver is refined and will try them as gold is tried they shall call on my name and i will hear them i will say it is my people and they shall say the lord is my god 141 behold the day of the lord cometh and thy spoil shall be divided in the midst of thee 142 for i will gather all nations against jerusalem to battle and the city shall be taken and the houses rifled and the women ravished and half of the city shall go forth into captivity and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city 143 then shall the lord go forth and fight against those nations as when he fought in the day of battle 144 and his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of olives which is before jerusalem on the east and the mount of olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west and there shall be a very great valley and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north and half of it toward the south 145 and ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto azal yea ye shall flee like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of uzziah king of judah and the lord my god shall come and all the saints with thee 146 and it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark 147 but it shall be one day which shall be known to the lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light 148 and it shall be in that day that living waters shall go out from jerusalem half of them toward the former sea and half of them toward the hinder sea in summer and in winter shall it be 149 and the lord shall be king over all the earth in that day shall there be one lord and his name one 1410 all the land shall be turned as a plain from geba to rimmon south of jerusalem and it shall be lifted up and inhabited in her place from benjamins gate unto the place of the first gate unto the corner gate and from the tower of hananeel unto the kings winepresses 1411 and men shall dwell in it and there shall be no more utter destruction but jerusalem shall be safely inhabited 1412 and this shall be the plague wherewith the lord will smite all the people that have fought against jerusalem their flesh shall consume away while they stand upon their feet and their eyes shall consume away in their holes and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth 1413 and it shall come to pass in that day that a great tumult from the lord shall be among them and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbour and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbour 1414 and judah also shall fight at jerusalem and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together gold and silver and apparel in great abundance 1415 and so shall be the plague of the horse of the mule of the camel and of the ass and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents as this plague 1416 and it shall come to pass that every one that is left of all the nations which came against jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king the lord of hosts and to keep the feast of tabernacles 1417 and it shall be that whoso will not come up of all the families of the earth unto jerusalem to worship the king the lord of hosts even upon them shall be no rain 1418 and if the family of egypt go not up and come not that have no rain there shall be the plague wherewith the lord will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles 1419 this shall be the punishment of egypt and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles 1420 in that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses holiness unto the lord and the pots in the lords house shall be like the bowls before the altar 1421 yea every pot in jerusalem and in judah shall be holiness unto the lord of hosts and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them and seethe therein and in that day there shall be no more the canaanite in the house of the lord of hosts malachi 11 the burden of the word of the lord to israel by malachi 12 i have loved you saith the lord yet ye say wherein hast thou loved us was not esau jacobs brother saith the lord yet i loved jacob 13 and i hated esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness 14 whereas edom saith we are impoverished but we will return and build the desolate places thus saith the lord of hosts they shall build but i will throw down and they shall call them the border of wickedness and the people against whom the lord hath indignation for ever 15 and your eyes shall see and ye shall say the lord will be magnified from the border of israel 16 a son honoureth his father and a servant his master if then i be a father where is mine honour and if i be a master where is my fear saith the lord of hosts unto you o priests that despise my name and ye say wherein have we despised thy name 17 ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar and ye say wherein have we polluted thee in that ye say the table of the lord is contemptible 18 and if ye offer the blind for sacrifice is it not evil and if ye offer the lame and sick is it not evil offer it now unto thy governor will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person saith the lord of hosts 19 and now i pray you beseech god that he will be gracious unto us this hath been by your means will he regard your persons saith the lord of hosts 110 who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought i have no pleasure in you saith the lord of hosts neither will i accept an offering at your hand 111 for from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the gentiles and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name and a pure offering for my name shall be great among the heathen saith the lord of hosts 112 but ye have profaned it in that ye say the table of the lord is polluted and the fruit thereof even his meat is contemptible 113 ye said also behold what a weariness is it and ye have snuffed at it saith the lord of hosts and ye brought that which was torn and the lame and the sick thus ye brought an offering should i accept this of your hand saith the lord 114 but cursed be the deceiver which hath in his flock a male and voweth and sacrificeth unto the lord a corrupt thing for i am a great king saith the lord of hosts and my name is dreadful among the heathen 21 and now o ye priests this commandment is for you 22 if ye will not hear and if ye will not lay it to heart to give glory unto my name saith the lord of hosts i will even send a curse upon you and i will curse your blessings yea i have cursed them already because ye do not lay it to heart 23 behold i will corrupt your seed and spread dung upon your faces even the dung of your solemn feasts and one shall take you away with it 24 and ye shall know that i have sent this commandment unto you that my covenant might be with levi saith the lord of hosts 25 my covenant was with him of life and peace and i gave them to him for the fear wherewith he feared me and was afraid before my name 26 the law of truth was in his mouth and iniquity was not found in his lips he walked with me in peace and equity and did turn many away from iniquity 27 for the priests lips should keep knowledge and they should seek the law at his mouth for he is the messenger of the lord of hosts 28 but ye are departed out of the way ye have caused many to stumble at the law ye have corrupted the covenant of levi saith the lord of hosts 29 therefore have i also made you contemptible and base before all the people according as ye have not kept my ways but have been partial in the law 210 have we not all one father hath not one god created us why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother by profaning the covenant of our fathers 211 judah hath dealt treacherously and an abomination is committed in israel and in jerusalem for judah hath profaned the holiness of the lord which he loved and hath married the daughter of a strange god 212 the lord will cut off the man that doeth this the master and the scholar out of the tabernacles of jacob and him that offereth an offering unto the lord of hosts 213 and this have ye done again covering the altar of the lord with tears with weeping and with crying out insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more or receiveth it with good will at your hand 214 yet ye say wherefore because the lord hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou hast dealt treacherously yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy covenant 215 and did not he make one yet had he the residue of the spirit and wherefore one that he might seek a godly seed therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth 216 for the lord the god of israel saith that he hateth putting away for one covereth violence with his garment saith the lord of hosts therefore take heed to your spirit that ye deal not treacherously 217 ye have wearied the lord with your words yet ye say wherein have we wearied him when ye say every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the lord and he delighteth in them or where is the god of judgment 31 behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me and the lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his temple even the messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in behold he shall come saith the lord of hosts 32 but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth for he is like a refiners fire and like fullers soap 33 and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver and he shall purify the sons of levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the lord an offering in righteousness 34 then shall the offering of judah and jerusalem be pleasant unto the lord as in the days of old and as in former years 35 and i will come near to you to judgment and i will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against false swearers and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages the widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger from his right and fear not me saith the lord of hosts 36 for i am the lord i change not therefore ye sons of jacob are not consumed 37 even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and i will return unto you saith the lord of hosts but ye said wherein shall we return 38 will a man rob god yet ye have robbed me but ye say wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings 39 ye are cursed with a curse for ye have robbed me even this whole nation 310 bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith saith the lord of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it 311 and i will rebuke the devourer for your sakes and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field saith the lord of hosts 312 and all nations shall call you blessed for ye shall be a delightsome land saith the lord of hosts 313 your words have been stout against me saith the lord yet ye say what have we spoken so much against thee 314 ye have said it is vain to serve god and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance and that we have walked mournfully before the lord of hosts 315 and now we call the proud happy yea they that work wickedness are set up yea they that tempt god are even delivered 316 then they that feared the lord spake often one to another and the lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord and that thought upon his name 317 and they shall be mine saith the lord of hosts in that day when i make up my jewels and i will spare them as a man spareth his own son that serveth him 318 then shall ye return and discern between the righteous and the wicked between him that serveth god and him that serveth him not 41 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch 42 but unto you that fear my name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall 43 and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that i shall do this saith the lord of hosts 44 remember ye the law of moses my servant which i commanded unto him in horeb for all israel with the statutes and judgments 45 behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord 46 and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse  the new testament of the king james bible the gospel according to saint matthew 11 the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham 12 abraham begat isaac and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat judas and his brethren 13 and judas begat phares and zara of thamar and phares begat esrom and esrom begat aram 14 and aram begat aminadab and aminadab begat naasson and naasson begat salmon 15 and salmon begat booz of rachab and booz begat obed of ruth and obed begat jesse 16 and jesse begat david the king and david the king begat solomon of her that had been the wife of urias 17 and solomon begat roboam and roboam begat abia and abia begat asa 18 and asa begat josaphat and josaphat begat joram and joram begat ozias 19 and ozias begat joatham and joatham begat achaz and achaz begat ezekias 110 and ezekias begat manasses and manasses begat amon and amon begat josias 111 and josias begat jechonias and his brethren about the time they were carried away to babylon 112 and after they were brought to babylon jechonias begat salathiel and salathiel begat zorobabel 113 and zorobabel begat abiud and abiud begat eliakim and eliakim begat azor 114 and azor begat sadoc and sadoc begat achim and achim begat eliud 115 and eliud begat eleazar and eleazar begat matthan and matthan begat jacob 116 and jacob begat joseph the husband of mary of whom was born jesus who is called christ 117 so all the generations from abraham to david are fourteen generations and from david until the carrying away into babylon are fourteen generations and from the carrying away into babylon unto christ are fourteen generations 118 now the birth of jesus christ was on this wise when as his mother mary was espoused to joseph before they came together she was found with child of the holy ghost 119 then joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a publick example was minded to put her away privily 120 but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the lord appeared unto him in a dream saying joseph thou son of david fear not to take unto thee mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is of the holy ghost 121 and she shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins 122 now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying 123 behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us 124 then joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife 125 and knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name jesus 21 now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judaea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem 22 saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him 23 when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all jerusalem with him 24 and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together he demanded of them where christ should be born 25 and they said unto him in bethlehem of judaea for thus it is written by the prophet 26 and thou bethlehem in the land of juda art not the least among the princes of juda for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people israel 27 then herod when he had privily called the wise men enquired of them diligently what time the star appeared 28 and he sent them to bethlehem and said go and search diligently for the young child and when ye have found him bring me word again that i may come and worship him also 29 when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was 210 when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceeding great joy 211 and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with mary his mother and fell down and worshipped him and when they had opened their treasures they presented unto him gifts gold and frankincense and myrrh 212 and being warned of god in a dream that they should not return to herod they departed into their own country another way 213 and when they were departed behold the angel of the lord appeareth to joseph in a dream saying arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into egypt and be thou there until i bring thee word for herod will seek the young child to destroy him 214 when he arose he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into egypt 215 and was there until the death of herod that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying out of egypt have i called my son 216 then herod when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men was exceeding wroth and sent forth and slew all the children that were in bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from two years old and under according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise men 217 then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying 218 in rama was there a voice heard lamentation and weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they are not 219 but when herod was dead behold an angel of the lord appeareth in a dream to joseph in egypt 220 saying arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of israel for they are dead which sought the young childs life 221 and he arose and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of israel 222 but when he heard that archelaus did reign in judaea in the room of his father herod he was afraid to go thither notwithstanding being warned of god in a dream he turned aside into the parts of galilee 223 and he came and dwelt in a city called nazareth that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets he shall be called a nazarene 31 in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judaea 32 and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand 33 for this is he that was spoken of by the prophet esaias saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight 34 and the same john had his raiment of camels hair and a leathern girdle about his loins and his meat was locusts and wild honey 35 then went out to him jerusalem and all judaea and all the region round about jordan 36 and were baptized of him in jordan confessing their sins 37 but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees come to his baptism he said unto them o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come 38 bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance 39 and think not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham 310 and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire 311 i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire 312 whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and gather his wheat into the garner but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire 313 then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him 314 but john forbad him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and comest thou to me 315 and jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness then he suffered him 316 and jesus when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting upon him 317 and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased 41 then was jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil 42 and when he had fasted forty days and forty nights he was afterward an hungred 43 and when the tempter came to him he said if thou be the son of god command that these stones be made bread 44 but he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god 45 then the devil taketh him up into the holy city and setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple 46 and saith unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone 47 jesus said unto him it is written again thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god 48 again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them 49 and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me 410 then saith jesus unto him get thee hence satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve 411 then the devil leaveth him and behold angels came and ministered unto him 412 now when jesus had heard that john was cast into prison he departed into galilee 413 and leaving nazareth he came and dwelt in capernaum which is upon the sea coast in the borders of zabulon and nephthalim 414 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying 415 the land of zabulon and the land of nephthalim by the way of the sea beyond jordan galilee of the gentiles 416 the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up 417 from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand 418 and jesus walking by the sea of galilee saw two brethren simon called peter and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers 419 and he saith unto them follow me and i will make you fishers of men 420 and they straightway left their nets and followed him 421 and going on from thence he saw other two brethren james the son of zebedee and john his brother in a ship with zebedee their father mending their nets and he called them 422 and they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him 423 and jesus went about all galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people 424 and his fame went throughout all syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatick and those that had the palsy and he healed them 425 and there followed him great multitudes of people from galilee and from decapolis and from jerusalem and from judaea and from beyond jordan 51 and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him 52 and he opened his mouth and taught them saying 53 blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven 54 blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted 55 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth 56 blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled 57 blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy 58 blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god 59 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god 510 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven 511 blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake 512 rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you 513 ye are the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be salted it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men 514 ye are the light of the world a city that is set on an hill cannot be hid 515 neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house 516 let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven 517 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfil 518 for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled 519 whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven 520 for i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven 521 ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not kill and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment 522 but i say unto you that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment and whosoever shall say to his brother raca shall be in danger of the council but whosoever shall say thou fool shall be in danger of hell fire 523 therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee 524 leave there thy gift before the altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift 525 agree with thine adversary quickly whiles thou art in the way with him lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and thou be cast into prison 526 verily i say unto thee thou shalt by no means come out thence till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing 527 ye have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not commit adultery 528 but i say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart 529 and if thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell 530 and if thy right hand offend thee cut it off and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell 531 it hath been said whosoever shall put away his wife let him give her a writing of divorcement 532 but i say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causeth her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery 533 again ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time thou shalt not forswear thyself but shalt perform unto the lord thine oaths 534 but i say unto you swear not at all neither by heaven for it is gods throne 535 nor by the earth for it is his footstool neither by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king 536 neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black 537 but let your communication be yea yea nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil 538 ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth 539 but i say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also 540 and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also 541 and whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile go with him twain 542 give to him that asketh thee and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away 543 ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy 544 but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you 545 that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust 546 for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same 547 and if ye salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the publicans so 548 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect 61 take heed that ye do not your alms before men to be seen of them otherwise ye have no reward of your father which is in heaven 62 therefore when thou doest thine alms do not sound a trumpet before thee as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men verily i say unto you they have their reward 63 but when thou doest alms let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth 64 that thine alms may be in secret and thy father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly 65 and when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward 66 but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou hast shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly 67 but when ye pray use not vain repetitions as the heathen do for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking 68 be not ye therefore like unto them for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him 69 after this manner therefore pray ye our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name 610 thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven 611 give us this day our daily bread 612 and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors 613 and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory for ever amen 614 for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you 615 but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses 616 moreover when ye fast be not as the hypocrites of a sad countenance for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast verily i say unto you they have their reward 617 but thou when thou fastest anoint thine head and wash thy face 618 that thou appear not unto men to fast but unto thy father which is in secret and thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly 619 lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal 620 but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal 621 for where your treasure is there will your heart be also 622 the light of the body is the eye if therefore thine eye be single thy whole body shall be full of light 623 but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness 624 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon 625 therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment 626 behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them are ye not much better than they 627 which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature 628 and why take ye thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin 629 and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these 630 wherefore if god so clothe the grass of the field which to day is and to morrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith 631 therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed 632 for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things 633 but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you 634 take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof 71 judge not that ye be not judged 72 for with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again 73 and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye 74 or how wilt thou say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye 75 thou hypocrite first cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brothers eye 76 give not that which is holy unto the dogs neither cast ye your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you 77 ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you 78 for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened 79 or what man is there of you whom if his son ask bread will he give him a stone 710 or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent 711 if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him 712 therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and the prophets 713 enter ye in at the strait gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction and many there be which go in thereat 714 because strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it 715 beware of false prophets which come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves 716 ye shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles 717 even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit 718 a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit 719 every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire 720 wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them 721 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven 722 many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works 723 and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity 724 therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock 725 and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock 726 and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand 727 and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it 728 and it came to pass when jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his doctrine 729 for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes 81 when he was come down from the mountain great multitudes followed him 82 and behold there came a leper and worshipped him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean 83 and jesus put forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou clean and immediately his leprosy was cleansed 84 and jesus saith unto him see thou tell no man but go thy way shew thyself to the priest and offer the gift that moses commanded for a testimony unto them 85 and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him a centurion beseeching him 86 and saying lord my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy grievously tormented 87 and jesus saith unto him i will come and heal him 88 the centurion answered and said lord i am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed 89 for i am a man under authority having soldiers under me and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it 810 when jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them that followed verily i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel 811 and i say unto you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down with abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven 812 but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth 813 and jesus said unto the centurion go thy way and as thou hast believed so be it done unto thee and his servant was healed in the selfsame hour 814 and when jesus was come into peters house he saw his wifes mother laid and sick of a fever 815 and he touched her hand and the fever left her and she arose and ministered unto them 816 when the even was come they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick 817 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses 818 now when jesus saw great multitudes about him he gave commandment to depart unto the other side 819 and a certain scribe came and said unto him master i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest 820 and jesus saith unto him the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head 821 and another of his disciples said unto him lord suffer me first to go and bury my father 822 but jesus said unto him follow me and let the dead bury their dead 823 and when he was entered into a ship his disciples followed him 824 and behold there arose a great tempest in the sea insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves but he was asleep 825 and his disciples came to him and awoke him saying lord save us we perish 826 and he saith unto them why are ye fearful o ye of little faith then he arose and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm 827 but the men marvelled saying what manner of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him 828 and when he was come to the other side into the country of the gergesenes there met him two possessed with devils coming out of the tombs exceeding fierce so that no man might pass by that way 829 and behold they cried out saying what have we to do with thee jesus thou son of god art thou come hither to torment us before the time 830 and there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding 831 so the devils besought him saying if thou cast us out suffer us to go away into the herd of swine 832 and he said unto them go and when they were come out they went into the herd of swine and behold the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters 833 and they that kept them fled and went their ways into the city and told every thing and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils 834 and behold the whole city came out to meet jesus and when they saw him they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts 91 and he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own city 92 and behold they brought to him a man sick of the palsy lying on a bed and jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee 93 and behold certain of the scribes said within themselves this man blasphemeth 94 and jesus knowing their thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in your hearts 95 for whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and walk 96 but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins then saith he to the sick of the palsy arise take up thy bed and go unto thine house 97 and he arose and departed to his house 98 but when the multitudes saw it they marvelled and glorified god which had given such power unto men 99 and as jesus passed forth from thence he saw a man named matthew sitting at the receipt of custom and he saith unto him follow me and he arose and followed him 910 and it came to pass as jesus sat at meat in the house behold many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his disciples 911 and when the pharisees saw it they said unto his disciples why eateth your master with publicans and sinners 912 but when jesus heard that he said unto them they that be whole need not a physician but they that are sick 913 but go ye and learn what that meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice for i am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance 914 then came to him the disciples of john saying why do we and the pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not 915 and jesus said unto them can the children of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall they fast 916 no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent is made worse 917 neither do men put new wine into old bottles else the bottles break and the wine runneth out and the bottles perish but they put new wine into new bottles and both are preserved 918 while he spake these things unto them behold there came a certain ruler and worshipped him saying my daughter is even now dead but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live 919 and jesus arose and followed him and so did his disciples 920 and behold a woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment 921 for she said within herself if i may but touch his garment i shall be whole 922 but jesus turned him about and when he saw her he said daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole and the woman was made whole from that hour 923 and when jesus came into the rulers house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise 924 he said unto them give place for the maid is not dead but sleepeth and they laughed him to scorn 925 but when the people were put forth he went in and took her by the hand and the maid arose 926 and the fame hereof went abroad into all that land 927 and when jesus departed thence two blind men followed him crying and saying thou son of david have mercy on us 928 and when he was come into the house the blind men came to him and jesus saith unto them believe ye that i am able to do this they said unto him yea lord 929 then touched he their eyes saying according to your faith be it unto you 930 and their eyes were opened and jesus straitly charged them saying see that no man know it 931 but they when they were departed spread abroad his fame in all that country 932 as they went out behold they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil 933 and when the devil was cast out the dumb spake and the multitudes marvelled saying it was never so seen in israel 934 but the pharisees said he casteth out devils through the prince of the devils 935 and jesus went about all the cities and villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people 936 but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd 937 then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the labourers are few 938 pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvest 101 and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease 102 now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simon who is called peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee and john his brother 103 philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the publican james the son of alphaeus and lebbaeus whose surname was thaddaeus 104 simon the canaanite and judas iscariot who also betrayed him 105 these twelve jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not 106 but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel 107 and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand 108 heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out devils freely ye have received freely give 109 provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses 1010 nor scrip for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet staves for the workman is worthy of his meat 1011 and into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter enquire who in it is worthy and there abide till ye go thence 1012 and when ye come into an house salute it 1013 and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you 1014 and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when ye depart out of that house or city shake off the dust of your feet 1015 verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city 1016 behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves 1017 but beware of men for they will deliver you up to the councils and they will scourge you in their synagogues 1018 and ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake for a testimony against them and the gentiles 1019 but when they deliver you up take no thought how or what ye shall speak for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak 1020 for it is not ye that speak but the spirit of your father which speaketh in you 1021 and the brother shall deliver up the brother to death and the father the child and the children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death 1022 and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved 1023 but when they persecute you in this city flee ye into another for verily i say unto you ye shall not have gone over the cities of israel till the son of man be come 1024 the disciple is not above his master nor the servant above his lord 1025 it is enough for the disciple that he be as his master and the servant as his lord if they have called the master of the house beelzebub how much more shall they call them of his household 1026 fear them not therefore for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed and hid that shall not be known 1027 what i tell you in darkness that speak ye in light and what ye hear in the ear that preach ye upon the housetops 1028 and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell 1029 are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father 1030 but the very hairs of your head are all numbered 1031 fear ye not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows 1032 whosoever therefore shall confess me before men him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven 1033 but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven 1034 think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword 1035 for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter in law against her mother in law 1036 and a mans foes shall be they of his own household 1037 he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me 1038 and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me 1039 he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it 1040 he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me 1041 he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophets reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous mans reward 1042 and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily i say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward 111 and it came to pass when jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities 112 now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples 113 and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another 114 jesus answered and said unto them go and shew john again those things which ye do hear and see 115 the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them 116 and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me 117 and as they departed jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness to see a reed shaken with the wind 118 but what went ye out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they that wear soft clothing are in kings houses 119 but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you and more than a prophet 1110 for this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee 1111 verily i say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he 1112 and from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force 1113 for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john 1114 and if ye will receive it this is elias which was for to come 1115 he that hath ears to hear let him hear 1116 but whereunto shall i liken this generation it is like unto children sitting in the markets and calling unto their fellows 1117 and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned unto you and ye have not lamented 1118 for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he hath a devil 1119 the son of man came eating and drinking and they say behold a man gluttonous and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners but wisdom is justified of her children 1120 then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done because they repented not 1121 woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes 1122 but i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the day of judgment than for you 1123 and thou capernaum which art exalted unto heaven shalt be brought down to hell for if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in sodom it would have remained until this day 1124 but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of sodom in the day of judgment than for thee 1125 at that time jesus answered and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes 1126 even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight 1127 all things are delivered unto me of my father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father save the son and he to whomsoever the son will reveal him 1128 come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and i will give you rest 1129 take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls 1130 for my yoke is easy and my burden is light 121 at that time jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn and his disciples were an hungred and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat 122 but when the pharisees saw it they said unto him behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day 123 but he said unto them have ye not read what david did when he was an hungred and they that were with him 124 how he entered into the house of god and did eat the shewbread which was not lawful for him to eat neither for them which were with him but only for the priests 125 or have ye not read in the law how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are blameless 126 but i say unto you that in this place is one greater than the temple 127 but if ye had known what this meaneth i will have mercy and not sacrifice ye would not have condemned the guiltless 128 for the son of man is lord even of the sabbath day 129 and when he was departed thence he went into their synagogue 1210 and behold there was a man which had his hand withered and they asked him saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days that they might accuse him 1211 and he said unto them what man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day will he not lay hold on it and lift it out 1212 how much then is a man better than a sheep wherefore it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days 1213 then saith he to the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretched it forth and it was restored whole like as the other 1214 then the pharisees went out and held a council against him how they might destroy him 1215 but when jesus knew it he withdrew himself from thence and great multitudes followed him and he healed them all 1216 and charged them that they should not make him known 1217 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by esaias the prophet saying 1218 behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased i will put my spirit upon him and he shall shew judgment to the gentiles 1219 he shall not strive nor cry neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets 1220 a bruised reed shall he not break and smoking flax shall he not quench till he send forth judgment unto victory 1221 and in his name shall the gentiles trust 1222 then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil blind and dumb and he healed him insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake and saw 1223 and all the people were amazed and said is not this the son of david 1224 but when the pharisees heard it they said this fellow doth not cast out devils but by beelzebub the prince of the devils 1225 and jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand 1226 and if satan cast out satan he is divided against himself how shall then his kingdom stand 1227 and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your children cast them out therefore they shall be your judges 1228 but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god is come unto you 1229 or else how can one enter into a strong mans house and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house 1230 he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad 1231 wherefore i say unto you all manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men but the blasphemy against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven unto men 1232 and whosoever speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speaketh against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come 1233 either make the tree good and his fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and his fruit corrupt for the tree is known by his fruit 1234 o generation of vipers how can ye being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh 1235 a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things 1236 but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment 1237 for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned 1238 then certain of the scribes and of the pharisees answered saying master we would see a sign from thee 1239 but he answered and said unto them an evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given to it but the sign of the prophet jonas 1240 for as jonas was three days and three nights in the whales belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth 1241 the men of nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here 1242 the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here 1243 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and findeth none 1244 then he saith i will return into my house from whence i came out and when he is come he findeth it empty swept and garnished 1245 then goeth he and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation 1246 while he yet talked to the people behold his mother and his brethren stood without desiring to speak with him 1247 then one said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to speak with thee 1248 but he answered and said unto him that told him who is my mother and who are my brethren 1249 and he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples and said behold my mother and my brethren 1250 for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven the same is my brother and sister and mother 131 the same day went jesus out of the house and sat by the sea side 132 and great multitudes were gathered together unto him so that he went into a ship and sat and the whole multitude stood on the shore 133 and he spake many things unto them in parables saying behold a sower went forth to sow 134 and when he sowed some seeds fell by the way side and the fowls came and devoured them up 135 some fell upon stony places where they had not much earth and forthwith they sprung up because they had no deepness of earth 136 and when the sun was up they were scorched and because they had no root they withered away 137 and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprung up and choked them 138 but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some an hundredfold some sixtyfold some thirtyfold 139 who hath ears to hear let him hear 1310 and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in parables 1311 he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given 1312 for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath 1313 therefore speak i to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand 1314 and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of esaias which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive 1315 for this peoples heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them 1316 but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear 1317 for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them 1318 hear ye therefore the parable of the sower 1319 when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the way side 1320 but he that received the seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy receiveth it 1321 yet hath he not root in himself but dureth for a while for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word by and by he is offended 1322 he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the care of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word and he becometh unfruitful 1323 but he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit and bringeth forth some an hundredfold some sixty some thirty 1324 another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field 1325 but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way 1326 but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also 1327 so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir didst not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tares 1328 he said unto them an enemy hath done this the servants said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up 1329 but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tares ye root up also the wheat with them 1330 let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn 1331 another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field 1332 which indeed is the least of all seeds but when it is grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof 1333 another parable spake he unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened 1334 all these things spake jesus unto the multitude in parables and without a parable spake he not unto them 1335 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world 1336 then jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field 1337 he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man 1338 the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one 1339 the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels 1340 as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world 1341 the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity 1342 and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth 1343 then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear let him hear 1344 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a field the which when a man hath found he hideth and for joy thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath and buyeth that field 1345 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man seeking goodly pearls 1346 who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it 1347 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind 1348 which when it was full they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels but cast the bad away 1349 so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just 1350 and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth 1351 jesus saith unto them have ye understood all these things they say unto him yea lord 1352 then said he unto them therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old 1353 and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these parables he departed thence 1354 and when he was come into his own country he taught them in their synagogue insomuch that they were astonished and said whence hath this man this wisdom and these mighty works 1355 is not this the carpenters son is not his mother called mary and his brethren james and joses and simon and judas 1356 and his sisters are they not all with us whence then hath this man all these things 1357 and they were offended in him but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honour save in his own country and in his own house 1358 and he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief 141 at that time herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of jesus 142 and said unto his servants this is john the baptist he is risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him 143 for herod had laid hold on john and bound him and put him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife 144 for john said unto him it is not lawful for thee to have her 145 and when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophet 146 but when herods birthday was kept the daughter of herodias danced before them and pleased herod 147 whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she would ask 148 and she being before instructed of her mother said give me here john baptists head in a charger 149 and the king was sorry nevertheless for the oaths sake and them which sat with him at meat he commanded it to be given her 1410 and he sent and beheaded john in the prison 1411 and his head was brought in a charger and given to the damsel and she brought it to her mother 1412 and his disciples came and took up the body and buried it and went and told jesus 1413 when jesus heard of it he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart and when the people had heard thereof they followed him on foot out of the cities 1414 and jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sick 1415 and when it was evening his disciples came to him saying this is a desert place and the time is now past send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves victuals 1416 but jesus said unto them they need not depart give ye them to eat 1417 and they say unto him we have here but five loaves and two fishes 1418 he said bring them hither to me 1419 and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass and took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed and brake and gave the loaves to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude 1420 and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the fragments that remained twelve baskets full 1421 and they that had eaten were about five thousand men beside women and children 1422 and straightway jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away 1423 and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone 1424 but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary 1425 and in the fourth watch of the night jesus went unto them walking on the sea 1426 and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear 1427 but straightway jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is i be not afraid 1428 and peter answered him and said lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water 1429 and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus 1430 but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me 1431 and immediately jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him o thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt 1432 and when they were come into the ship the wind ceased 1433 then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him saying of a truth thou art the son of god 1434 and when they were gone over they came into the land of gennesaret 1435 and when the men of that place had knowledge of him they sent out into all that country round about and brought unto him all that were diseased 1436 and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment and as many as touched were made perfectly whole 151 then came to jesus scribes and pharisees which were of jerusalem saying 152 why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread 153 but he answered and said unto them why do ye also transgress the commandment of god by your tradition 154 for god commanded saying honour thy father and mother and he that curseth father or mother let him die the death 155 but ye say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother it is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me 156 and honour not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have ye made the commandment of god of none effect by your tradition 157 ye hypocrites well did esaias prophesy of you saying 158 this people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me 159 but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men 1510 and he called the multitude and said unto them hear and understand 1511 not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man but that which cometh out of the mouth this defileth a man 1512 then came his disciples and said unto him knowest thou that the pharisees were offended after they heard this saying 1513 but he answered and said every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up 1514 let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch 1515 then answered peter and said unto him declare unto us this parable 1516 and jesus said are ye also yet without understanding 1517 do not ye yet understand that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly and is cast out into the draught 1518 but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart and they defile the man 1519 for out of the heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemies 1520 these are the things which defile a man but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man 1521 then jesus went thence and departed into the coasts of tyre and sidon 1522 and behold a woman of canaan came out of the same coasts and cried unto him saying have mercy on me o lord thou son of david my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil 1523 but he answered her not a word and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crieth after us 1524 but he answered and said i am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of israel 1525 then came she and worshipped him saying lord help me 1526 but he answered and said it is not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast it to dogs 1527 and she said truth lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters table 1528 then jesus answered and said unto her o woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou wilt and her daughter was made whole from that very hour 1529 and jesus departed from thence and came nigh unto the sea of galilee and went up into a mountain and sat down there 1530 and great multitudes came unto him having with them those that were lame blind dumb maimed and many others and cast them down at jesus feet and he healed them 1531 insomuch that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb to speak the maimed to be whole the lame to walk and the blind to see and they glorified the god of israel 1532 then jesus called his disciples unto him and said i have compassion on the multitude because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat and i will not send them away fasting lest they faint in the way 1533 and his disciples say unto him whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness as to fill so great a multitude 1534 and jesus saith unto them how many loaves have ye and they said seven and a few little fishes 1535 and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground 1536 and he took the seven loaves and the fishes and gave thanks and brake them and gave to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude 1537 and they did all eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full 1538 and they that did eat were four thousand men beside women and children 1539 and he sent away the multitude and took ship and came into the coasts of magdala 161 the pharisees also with the sadducees came and tempting desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven 162 he answered and said unto them when it is evening ye say it will be fair weather for the sky is red 163 and in the morning it will be foul weather to day for the sky is red and lowering o ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky but can ye not discern the signs of the times 164 a wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given unto it but the sign of the prophet jonas and he left them and departed 165 and when his disciples were come to the other side they had forgotten to take bread 166 then jesus said unto them take heed and beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees 167 and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have taken no bread 168 which when jesus perceived he said unto them o ye of little faith why reason ye among yourselves because ye have brought no bread 169 do ye not yet understand neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand and how many baskets ye took up 1610 neither the seven loaves of the four thousand and how many baskets ye took up 1611 how is it that ye do not understand that i spake it not to you concerning bread that ye should beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees 1612 then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees 1613 when jesus came into the coasts of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that i the son of man am 1614 and they said some say that thou art john the baptist some elias and others jeremias or one of the prophets 1615 he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am 1616 and simon peter answered and said thou art the christ the son of the living god 1617 and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven 1618 and i say also unto thee that thou art peter and upon this rock i will build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it 1619 and i will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven 1620 then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was jesus the christ 1621 from that time forth began jesus to shew unto his disciples how that he must go unto jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day 1622 then peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from thee lord this shall not be unto thee 1623 but he turned and said unto peter get thee behind me satan thou art an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of god but those that be of men 1624 then said jesus unto his disciples if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me 1625 for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it 1626 for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul 1627 for the son of man shall come in the glory of his father with his angels and then he shall reward every man according to his works 1628 verily i say unto you there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the son of man coming in his kingdom 171 and after six days jesus taketh peter james and john his brother and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart 172 and was transfigured before them and his face did shine as the sun and his raiment was white as the light 173 and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him 174 then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias 175 while he yet spake behold a bright cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him 176 and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were sore afraid 177 and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid 178 and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only 179 and as they came down from the mountain jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead 1710 and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come 1711 and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things 1712 but i say unto you that elias is come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them 1713 then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of john the baptist 1714 and when they were come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying 1715 lord have mercy on my son for he is lunatick and sore vexed for ofttimes he falleth into the fire and oft into the water 1716 and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him 1717 then jesus answered and said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him hither to me 1718 and jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour 1719 then came the disciples to jesus apart and said why could not we cast him out 1720 and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you 1721 howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting 1722 and while they abode in galilee jesus said unto them the son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men 1723 and they shall kill him and the third day he shall be raised again and they were exceeding sorry 1724 and when they were come to capernaum they that received tribute money came to peter and said doth not your master pay tribute 1725 he saith yes and when he was come into the house jesus prevented him saying what thinkest thou simon of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute of their own children or of strangers 1726 peter saith unto him of strangers jesus saith unto him then are the children free 1727 notwithstanding lest we should offend them go thou to the sea and cast an hook and take up the fish that first cometh up and when thou hast opened his mouth thou shalt find a piece of money that take and give unto them for me and thee 181 at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven 182 and jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them 183 and said verily i say unto you except ye be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven 184 whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven 185 and whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me 186 but whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea 187 woe unto the world because of offences for it must needs be that offences come but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh 188 wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee cut them off and cast them from thee it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire 189 and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out and cast it from thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire 1810 take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven 1811 for the son of man is come to save that which was lost 1812 how think ye if a man have an hundred sheep and one of them be gone astray doth he not leave the ninety and nine and goeth into the mountains and seeketh that which is gone astray 1813 and if so be that he find it verily i say unto you he rejoiceth more of that sheep than of the ninety and nine which went not astray 1814 even so it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish 1815 moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone if he shall hear thee thou hast gained thy brother 1816 but if he will not hear thee then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established 1817 and if he shall neglect to hear them tell it unto the church but if he neglect to hear the church let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican 1818 verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven 1819 again i say unto you that if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven 1820 for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am i in the midst of them 1821 then came peter to him and said lord how oft shall my brother sin against me and i forgive him till seven times 1822 jesus saith unto him i say not unto thee until seven times but until seventy times seven 1823 therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king which would take account of his servants 1824 and when he had begun to reckon one was brought unto him which owed him ten thousand talents 1825 but forasmuch as he had not to pay his lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and children and all that he had and payment to be made 1826 the servant therefore fell down and worshipped him saying lord have patience with me and i will pay thee all 1827 then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt 1828 but the same servant went out and found one of his fellowservants which owed him an hundred pence and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest 1829 and his fellowservant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and i will pay thee all 1830 and he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt 1831 so when his fellowservants saw what was done they were very sorry and came and told unto their lord all that was done 1832 then his lord after that he had called him said unto him o thou wicked servant i forgave thee all that debt because thou desiredst me 1833 shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellowservant even as i had pity on thee 1834 and his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him 1835 so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses 191 and it came to pass that when jesus had finished these sayings he departed from galilee and came into the coasts of judaea beyond jordan 192 and great multitudes followed him and he healed them there 193 the pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause 194 and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female 195 and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh 196 wherefore they are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder 197 they say unto him why did moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away 198 he saith unto them moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so 199 and i say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery 1910 his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it is not good to marry 1911 but he said unto them all men cannot receive this saying save they to whom it is given 1912 for there are some eunuchs which were so born from their mothers womb and there are some eunuchs which were made eunuchs of men and there be eunuchs which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heavens sake he that is able to receive it let him receive it 1913 then were there brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them and pray and the disciples rebuked them 1914 but jesus said suffer little children and forbid them not to come unto me for of such is the kingdom of heaven 1915 and he laid his hands on them and departed thence 1916 and behold one came and said unto him good master what good thing shall i do that i may have eternal life 1917 and he said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is god but if thou wilt enter into life keep the commandments 1918 he saith unto him which jesus said thou shalt do no murder thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness 1919 honour thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself 1920 the young man saith unto him all these things have i kept from my youth up what lack i yet 1921 jesus said unto him if thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me 1922 but when the young man heard that saying he went away sorrowful for he had great possessions 1923 then said jesus unto his disciples verily i say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven 1924 and again i say unto you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god 1925 when his disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved 1926 but jesus beheld them and said unto them with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible 1927 then answered peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken all and followed thee what shall we have therefore 1928 and jesus said unto them verily i say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel 1929 and every one that hath forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my names sake shall receive an hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life 1930 but many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first 201 for the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder which went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard 202 and when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day he sent them into his vineyard 203 and he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace 204 and said unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right i will give you and they went their way 205 again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise 206 and about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle and saith unto them why stand ye here all the day idle 207 they say unto him because no man hath hired us he saith unto them go ye also into the vineyard and whatsoever is right that shall ye receive 208 so when even was come the lord of the vineyard saith unto his steward call the labourers and give them their hire beginning from the last unto the first 209 and when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour they received every man a penny 2010 but when the first came they supposed that they should have received more and they likewise received every man a penny 2011 and when they had received it they murmured against the goodman of the house 2012 saying these last have wrought but one hour and thou hast made them equal unto us which have borne the burden and heat of the day 2013 but he answered one of them and said friend i do thee no wrong didst not thou agree with me for a penny 2014 take that thine is and go thy way i will give unto this last even as unto thee 2015 is it not lawful for me to do what i will with mine own is thine eye evil because i am good 2016 so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen 2017 and jesus going up to jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said unto them 2018 behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death 2019 and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again 2020 then came to him the mother of zebedees children with her sons worshipping him and desiring a certain thing of him 2021 and he said unto her what wilt thou she saith unto him grant that these my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom 2022 but jesus answered and said ye know not what ye ask are ye able to drink of the cup that i shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with they say unto him we are able 2023 and he saith unto them ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father 2024 and when the ten heard it they were moved with indignation against the two brethren 2025 but jesus called them unto him and said ye know that the princes of the gentiles exercise dominion over them and they that are great exercise authority upon them 2026 but it shall not be so among you but whosoever will be great among you let him be your minister 2027 and whosoever will be chief among you let him be your servant 2028 even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many 2029 and as they departed from jericho a great multitude followed him 2030 and behold two blind men sitting by the way side when they heard that jesus passed by cried out saying have mercy on us o lord thou son of david 2031 and the multitude rebuked them because they should hold their peace but they cried the more saying have mercy on us o lord thou son of david 2032 and jesus stood still and called them and said what will ye that i shall do unto you 2033 they say unto him lord that our eyes may be opened 2034 so jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him 211 and when they drew nigh unto jerusalem and were come to bethphage unto the mount of olives then sent jesus two disciples 212 saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her loose them and bring them unto me 213 and if any man say ought unto you ye shall say the lord hath need of them and straightway he will send them 214 all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying 215 tell ye the daughter of sion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt the foal of an ass 216 and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them 217 and brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes and they set him thereon 218 and a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way 219 and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest 2110 and when he was come into jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this 2111 and the multitude said this is jesus the prophet of nazareth of galilee 2112 and jesus went into the temple of god and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves 2113 and said unto them it is written my house shall be called the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves 2114 and the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and he healed them 2115 and when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying in the temple and saying hosanna to the son of david they were sore displeased 2116 and said unto him hearest thou what these say and jesus saith unto them yea have ye never read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise 2117 and he left them and went out of the city into bethany and he lodged there 2118 now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered 2119 and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing thereon but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever and presently the fig tree withered away 2120 and when the disciples saw it they marvelled saying how soon is the fig tree withered away 2121 jesus answered and said unto them verily i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done 2122 and all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive 2123 and when he was come into the temple the chief priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said by what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority 2124 and jesus answered and said unto them i also will ask you one thing which if ye tell me i in like wise will tell you by what authority i do these things 2125 the baptism of john whence was it from heaven or of men and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say unto us why did ye not then believe him 2126 but if we shall say of men we fear the people for all hold john as a prophet 2127 and they answered jesus and said we cannot tell and he said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things 2128 but what think ye a certain man had two sons and he came to the first and said son go work to day in my vineyard 2129 he answered and said i will not but afterward he repented and went 2130 and he came to the second and said likewise and he answered and said i go sir and went not 2131 whether of them twain did the will of his father they say unto him the first jesus saith unto them verily i say unto you that the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of god before you 2132 for john came unto you in the way of righteousness and ye believed him not but the publicans and the harlots believed him and ye when ye had seen it repented not afterward that ye might believe him 2133 hear another parable there was a certain householder which planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and digged a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country 2134 and when the time of the fruit drew near he sent his servants to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it 2135 and the husbandmen took his servants and beat one and killed another and stoned another 2136 again he sent other servants more than the first and they did unto them likewise 2137 but last of all he sent unto them his son saying they will reverence my son 2138 but when the husbandmen saw the son they said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and let us seize on his inheritance 2139 and they caught him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him 2140 when the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh what will he do unto those husbandmen 2141 they say unto him he will miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen which shall render him the fruits in their seasons 2142 jesus saith unto them did ye never read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner this is the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes 2143 therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof 2144 and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder 2145 and when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parables they perceived that he spake of them 2146 but when they sought to lay hands on him they feared the multitude because they took him for a prophet 221 and jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and said 222 the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son 223 and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come 224 again he sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden behold i have prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come unto the marriage 225 but they made light of it and went their ways one to his farm another to his merchandise 226 and the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them 227 but when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city 228 then saith he to his servants the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy 229 go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage 2210 so those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests 2211 and when the king came in to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment 2212 and he saith unto him friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless 2213 then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth 2214 for many are called but few are chosen 2215 then went the pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk 2216 and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying master we know that thou art true and teachest the way of god in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men 2217 tell us therefore what thinkest thou is it lawful to give tribute unto caesar or not 2218 but jesus perceived their wickedness and said why tempt ye me ye hypocrites 2219 shew me the tribute money and they brought unto him a penny 2220 and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription 2221 they say unto him caesars then saith he unto them render therefore unto caesar the things which are caesars and unto god the things that are gods 2222 when they had heard these words they marvelled and left him and went their way 2223 the same day came to him the sadducees which say that there is no resurrection and asked him 2224 saying master moses said if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother 2225 now there were with us seven brethren and the first when he had married a wife deceased and having no issue left his wife unto his brother 2226 likewise the second also and the third unto the seventh 2227 and last of all the woman died also 2228 therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven for they all had her 2229 jesus answered and said unto them ye do err not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god 2230 for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels of god in heaven 2231 but as touching the resurrection of the dead have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by god saying 2232 i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob god is not the god of the dead but of the living 2233 and when the multitude heard this they were astonished at his doctrine 2234 but when the pharisees had heard that he had put the sadducees to silence they were gathered together 2235 then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him and saying 2236 master which is the great commandment in the law 2237 jesus said unto him thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind 2238 this is the first and great commandment 2239 and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself 2240 on these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets 2241 while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them 2242 saying what think ye of christ whose son is he they say unto him the son of david 2243 he saith unto them how then doth david in spirit call him lord saying 2244 the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool 2245 if david then call him lord how is he his son 2246 and no man was able to answer him a word neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions 231 then spake jesus to the multitude and to his disciples 232 saying the scribes and the pharisees sit in moses seat 233 all therefore whatsoever they bid you observe that observe and do but do not ye after their works for they say and do not 234 for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on mens shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers 235 but all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments 236 and love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues 237 and greetings in the markets and to be called of men rabbi rabbi 238 but be not ye called rabbi for one is your master even christ and all ye are brethren 239 and call no man your father upon the earth for one is your father which is in heaven 2310 neither be ye called masters for one is your master even christ 2311 but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant 2312 and whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted 2313 but woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in 2314 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation 2315 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he is made ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves 2316 woe unto you ye blind guides which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor 2317 ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gold or the temple that sanctifieth the gold 2318 and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it he is guilty 2319 ye fools and blind for whether is greater the gift or the altar that sanctifieth the gift 2320 whoso therefore shall swear by the altar sweareth by it and by all things thereon 2321 and whoso shall swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein 2322 and he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of god and by him that sitteth thereon 2323 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone 2324 ye blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel 2325 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess 2326 thou blind pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also 2327 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead mens bones and of all uncleanness 2328 even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity 2329 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites because ye build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous 2330 and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets 2331 wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets 2332 fill ye up then the measure of your fathers 2333 ye serpents ye generation of vipers how can ye escape the damnation of hell 2334 wherefore behold i send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them ye shall kill and crucify and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city 2335 that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous abel unto the blood of zacharias son of barachias whom ye slew between the temple and the altar 2336 verily i say unto you all these things shall come upon this generation 2337 o jerusalem jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings and ye would not 2338 behold your house is left unto you desolate 2339 for i say unto you ye shall not see me henceforth till ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord 241 and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple 242 and jesus said unto them see ye not all these things verily i say unto you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down 243 and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world 244 and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you 245 for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many 246 and ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet 247 for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places 248 all these are the beginning of sorrows 249 then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sake 2410 and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another 2411 and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many 2412 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold 2413 but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved 2414 and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come 2415 when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand 2416 then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountains 2417 let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house 2418 neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes 2419 and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days 2420 but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day 2421 for then shall be great tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be 2422 and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened 2423 then if any man shall say unto you lo here is christ or there believe it not 2424 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall shew great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect 2425 behold i have told you before 2426 wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not 2427 for as the lightning cometh out of the east and shineth even unto the west so shall also the coming of the son of man be 2428 for wheresoever the carcase is there will the eagles be gathered together 2429 immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken 2430 and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory 2431 and he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other 2432 now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is nigh 2433 so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors 2434 verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled 2435 heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away 2436 but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only 2437 but as the days of noe were so shall also the coming of the son of man be 2438 for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark 2439 and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be 2440 then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left 2441 two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other left 2442 watch therefore for ye know not what hour your lord doth come 2443 but know this that if the goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up 2444 therefore be ye also ready for in such an hour as ye think not the son of man cometh 2445 who then is a faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them meat in due season 2446 blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing 2447 verily i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his goods 2448 but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming 2449 and shall begin to smite his fellowservants and to eat and drink with the drunken 2450 the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and in an hour that he is not aware of 2451 and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth 251 then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom 252 and five of them were wise and five were foolish 253 they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them 254 but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps 255 while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept 256 and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him 257 then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps 258 and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out 259 but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves 2510 and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut 2511 afterward came also the other virgins saying lord lord open to us 2512 but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not 2513 watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh 2514 for the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country who called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods 2515 and unto one he gave five talents to another two and to another one to every man according to his several ability and straightway took his journey 2516 then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made them other five talents 2517 and likewise he that had received two he also gained other two 2518 but he that had received one went and digged in the earth and hid his lords money 2519 after a long time the lord of those servants cometh and reckoneth with them 2520 and so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying lord thou deliveredst unto me five talents behold i have gained beside them five talents more 2521 his lord said unto him well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord 2522 he also that had received two talents came and said lord thou deliveredst unto me two talents behold i have gained two other talents beside them 2523 his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord 2524 then he which had received the one talent came and said lord i knew thee that thou art an hard man reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not strawed 2525 and i was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast that is thine 2526 his lord answered and said unto him thou wicked and slothful servant thou knewest that i reap where i sowed not and gather where i have not strawed 2527 thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming i should have received mine own with usury 2528 take therefore the talent from him and give it unto him which hath ten talents 2529 for unto every one that hath shall be given and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath 2530 and cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth 2531 when the son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory 2532 and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats 2533 and he shall set the sheep on his right hand but the goats on the left 2534 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world 2535 for i was an hungred and ye gave me meat i was thirsty and ye gave me drink i was a stranger and ye took me in 2536 naked and ye clothed me i was sick and ye visited me i was in prison and ye came unto me 2537 then shall the righteous answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink 2538 when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee 2539 or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee 2540 and the king shall answer and say unto them verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me 2541 then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels 2542 for i was an hungred and ye gave me no meat i was thirsty and ye gave me no drink 2543 i was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not sick and in prison and ye visited me not 2544 then shall they also answer him saying lord when saw we thee an hungred or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee 2545 then shall he answer them saying verily i say unto you inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these ye did it not to me 2546 and these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal 261 and it came to pass when jesus had finished all these sayings he said unto his disciples 262 ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified 263 then assembled together the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people unto the palace of the high priest who was called caiaphas 264 and consulted that they might take jesus by subtilty and kill him 265 but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar among the people 266 now when jesus was in bethany in the house of simon the leper 267 there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat 268 but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste 269 for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor 2610 when jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me 2611 for ye have the poor always with you but me ye have not always 2612 for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial 2613 verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of her 2614 then one of the twelve called judas iscariot went unto the chief priests 2615 and said unto them what will ye give me and i will deliver him unto you and they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver 2616 and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him 2617 now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying unto him where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover 2618 and he said go into the city to such a man and say unto him the master saith my time is at hand i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples 2619 and the disciples did as jesus had appointed them and they made ready the passover 2620 now when the even was come he sat down with the twelve 2621 and as they did eat he said verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me 2622 and they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them to say unto him lord is it i 2623 and he answered and said he that dippeth his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me 2624 the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had not been born 2625 then judas which betrayed him answered and said master is it i he said unto him thou hast said 2626 and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and brake it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body 2627 and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it 2628 for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins 2629 but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom 2630 and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives 2631 then saith jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad 2632 but after i am risen again i will go before you into galilee 2633 peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will i never be offended 2634 jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee that this night before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice 2635 peter said unto him though i should die with thee yet will i not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples 2636 then cometh jesus with them unto a place called gethsemane and saith unto the disciples sit ye here while i go and pray yonder 2637 and he took with him peter and the two sons of zebedee and began to be sorrowful and very heavy 2638 then saith he unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death tarry ye here and watch with me 2639 and he went a little farther and fell on his face and prayed saying o my father if it be possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not as i will but as thou wilt 2640 and he cometh unto the disciples and findeth them asleep and saith unto peter what could ye not watch with me one hour 2641 watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak 2642 he went away again the second time and prayed saying o my father if this cup may not pass away from me except i drink it thy will be done 2643 and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy 2644 and he left them and went away again and prayed the third time saying the same words 2645 then cometh he to his disciples and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners 2646 rise let us be going behold he is at hand that doth betray me 2647 and while he yet spake lo judas one of the twelve came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and elders of the people 2648 now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he hold him fast 2649 and forthwith he came to jesus and said hail master and kissed him 2650 and jesus said unto him friend wherefore art thou come then came they and laid hands on jesus and took him 2651 and behold one of them which were with jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck a servant of the high priests and smote off his ear 2652 then said jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword 2653 thinkest thou that i cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels 2654 but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be 2655 in that same hour said jesus to the multitudes are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me i sat daily with you teaching in the temple and ye laid no hold on me 2656 but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled then all the disciples forsook him and fled 2657 and they that had laid hold on jesus led him away to caiaphas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled 2658 but peter followed him afar off unto the high priests palace and went in and sat with the servants to see the end 2659 now the chief priests and elders and all the council sought false witness against jesus to put him to death 2660 but found none yea though many false witnesses came yet found they none at the last came two false witnesses 2661 and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days 2662 and the high priest arose and said unto him answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee 2663 but jesus held his peace and the high priest answered and said unto him i adjure thee by the living god that thou tell us whether thou be the christ the son of god 2664 jesus saith unto him thou hast said nevertheless i say unto you hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven 2665 then the high priest rent his clothes saying he hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses behold now ye have heard his blasphemy 2666 what think ye they answered and said he is guilty of death 2667 then did they spit in his face and buffeted him and others smote him with the palms of their hands 2668 saying prophesy unto us thou christ who is he that smote thee 2669 now peter sat without in the palace and a damsel came unto him saying thou also wast with jesus of galilee 2670 but he denied before them all saying i know not what thou sayest 2671 and when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto them that were there this fellow was also with jesus of nazareth 2672 and again he denied with an oath i do not know the man 2673 and after a while came unto him they that stood by and said to peter surely thou also art one of them for thy speech bewrayeth thee 2674 then began he to curse and to swear saying i know not the man and immediately the cock crew 2675 and peter remembered the word of jesus which said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice and he went out and wept bitterly 271 when the morning was come all the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against jesus to put him to death 272 and when they had bound him they led him away and delivered him to pontius pilate the governor 273 then judas which had betrayed him when he saw that he was condemned repented himself and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders 274 saying i have sinned in that i have betrayed the innocent blood and they said what is that to us see thou to that 275 and he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed and went and hanged himself 276 and the chief priests took the silver pieces and said it is not lawful for to put them into the treasury because it is the price of blood 277 and they took counsel and bought with them the potters field to bury strangers in 278 wherefore that field was called the field of blood unto this day 279 then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of israel did value 2710 and gave them for the potters field as the lord appointed me 2711 and jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and jesus said unto him thou sayest 2712 and when he was accused of the chief priests and elders he answered nothing 2713 then said pilate unto him hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee 2714 and he answered him to never a word insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly 2715 now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the people a prisoner whom they would 2716 and they had then a notable prisoner called barabbas 2717 therefore when they were gathered together pilate said unto them whom will ye that i release unto you barabbas or jesus which is called christ 2718 for he knew that for envy they had delivered him 2719 when he was set down on the judgment seat his wife sent unto him saying have thou nothing to do with that just man for i have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him 2720 but the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask barabbas and destroy jesus 2721 the governor answered and said unto them whether of the twain will ye that i release unto you they said barabbas 2722 pilate saith unto them what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ they all say unto him let him be crucified 2723 and the governor said why what evil hath he done but they cried out the more saying let him be crucified 2724 when pilate saw that he could prevail nothing but that rather a tumult was made he took water and washed his hands before the multitude saying i am innocent of the blood of this just person see ye to it 2725 then answered all the people and said his blood be on us and on our children 2726 then released he barabbas unto them and when he had scourged jesus he delivered him to be crucified 2727 then the soldiers of the governor took jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers 2728 and they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe 2729 and when they had platted a crown of thorns they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him saying hail king of the jews 2730 and they spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head 2731 and after that they had mocked him they took the robe off from him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him 2732 and as they came out they found a man of cyrene simon by name him they compelled to bear his cross 2733 and when they were come unto a place called golgotha that is to say a place of a skull 2734 they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall and when he had tasted thereof he would not drink 2735 and they crucified him and parted his garments casting lots that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots 2736 and sitting down they watched him there 2737 and set up over his head his accusation written this is jesus the king of the jews 2738 then were there two thieves crucified with him one on the right hand and another on the left 2739 and they that passed by reviled him wagging their heads 2740 and saying thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days save thyself if thou be the son of god come down from the cross 2741 likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said 2742 he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him 2743 he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god 2744 the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth 2745 now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour 2746 and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me 2747 some of them that stood there when they heard that said this man calleth for elias 2748 and straightway one of them ran and took a spunge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink 2749 the rest said let be let us see whether elias will come to save him 2750 jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost 2751 and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent 2752 and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose 2753 and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many 2754 now when the centurion and they that were with him watching jesus saw the earthquake and those things that were done they feared greatly saying truly this was the son of god 2755 and many women were there beholding afar off which followed jesus from galilee ministering unto him 2756 among which was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and joses and the mother of zebedees children 2757 when the even was come there came a rich man of arimathaea named joseph who also himself was jesus disciple 2758 he went to pilate and begged the body of jesus then pilate commanded the body to be delivered 2759 and when joseph had taken the body he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth 2760 and laid it in his own new tomb which he had hewn out in the rock and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed 2761 and there was mary magdalene and the other mary sitting over against the sepulchre 2762 now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate 2763 saying sir we remember that that deceiver said while he was yet alive after three days i will rise again 2764 command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he is risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first 2765 pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as ye can 2766 so they went and made the sepulchre sure sealing the stone and setting a watch 281 in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre 282 and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it 283 his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow 284 and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men 285 and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified 286 he is not here for he is risen as he said come see the place where the lord lay 287 and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead and behold he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him lo i have told you 288 and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word 289 and as they went to tell his disciples behold jesus met them saying all hail and they came and held him by the feet and worshipped him 2810 then said jesus unto them be not afraid go tell my brethren that they go into galilee and there shall they see me 2811 now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were done 2812 and when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers 2813 saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept 2814 and if this come to the governors ears we will persuade him and secure you 2815 so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is commonly reported among the jews until this day 2816 then the eleven disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them 2817 and when they saw him they worshipped him but some doubted 2818 and jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in earth 2819 go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost 2820 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the world amen the gospel according to saint mark 11 the beginning of the gospel of jesus christ the son of god 12 as it is written in the prophets behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee 13 the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight 14 john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins 15 and there went out unto him all the land of judaea and they of jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of jordan confessing their sins 16 and john was clothed with camels hair and with a girdle of a skin about his loins and he did eat locusts and wild honey 17 and preached saying there cometh one mightier than i after me the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to stoop down and unloose 18 i indeed have baptized you with water but he shall baptize you with the holy ghost 19 and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized of john in jordan 110 and straightway coming up out of the water he saw the heavens opened and the spirit like a dove descending upon him 111 and there came a voice from heaven saying thou art my beloved son in whom i am well pleased 112 and immediately the spirit driveth him into the wilderness 113 and he was there in the wilderness forty days tempted of satan and was with the wild beasts and the angels ministered unto him 114 now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel of the kingdom of god 115 and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel 116 now as he walked by the sea of galilee he saw simon and andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were fishers 117 and jesus said unto them come ye after me and i will make you to become fishers of men 118 and straightway they forsook their nets and followed him 119 and when he had gone a little farther thence he saw james the son of zebedee and john his brother who also were in the ship mending their nets 120 and straightway he called them and they left their father zebedee in the ship with the hired servants and went after him 121 and they went into capernaum and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught 122 and they were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one that had authority and not as the scribes 123 and there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit and he cried out 124 saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god 125 and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him 126 and when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried with a loud voice he came out of him 127 and they were all amazed insomuch that they questioned among themselves saying what thing is this what new doctrine is this for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits and they do obey him 128 and immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about galilee 129 and forthwith when they were come out of the synagogue they entered into the house of simon and andrew with james and john 130 but simons wifes mother lay sick of a fever and anon they tell him of her 131 and he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up and immediately the fever left her and she ministered unto them 132 and at even when the sun did set they brought unto him all that were diseased and them that were possessed with devils 133 and all the city was gathered together at the door 134 and he healed many that were sick of divers diseases and cast out many devils and suffered not the devils to speak because they knew him 135 and in the morning rising up a great while before day he went out and departed into a solitary place and there prayed 136 and simon and they that were with him followed after him 137 and when they had found him they said unto him all men seek for thee 138 and he said unto them let us go into the next towns that i may preach there also for therefore came i forth 139 and he preached in their synagogues throughout all galilee and cast out devils 140 and there came a leper to him beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean 141 and jesus moved with compassion put forth his hand and touched him and saith unto him i will be thou clean 142 and as soon as he had spoken immediately the leprosy departed from him and he was cleansed 143 and he straitly charged him and forthwith sent him away 144 and saith unto him see thou say nothing to any man but go thy way shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing those things which moses commanded for a testimony unto them 145 but he went out and began to publish it much and to blaze abroad the matter insomuch that jesus could no more openly enter into the city but was without in desert places and they came to him from every quarter 21 and again he entered into capernaum after some days and it was noised that he was in the house 22 and straightway many were gathered together insomuch that there was no room to receive them no not so much as about the door and he preached the word unto them 23 and they come unto him bringing one sick of the palsy which was borne of four 24 and when they could not come nigh unto him for the press they uncovered the roof where he was and when they had broken it up they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay 25 when jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of the palsy son thy sins be forgiven thee 26 but there was certain of the scribes sitting there and reasoning in their hearts 27 why doth this man thus speak blasphemies who can forgive sins but god only 28 and immediately when jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves he said unto them why reason ye these things in your hearts 29 whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy thy sins be forgiven thee or to say arise and take up thy bed and walk 210 but that ye may know that the son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins he saith to the sick of the palsy 211 i say unto thee arise and take up thy bed and go thy way into thine house 212 and immediately he arose took up the bed and went forth before them all insomuch that they were all amazed and glorified god saying we never saw it on this fashion 213 and he went forth again by the sea side and all the multitude resorted unto him and he taught them 214 and as he passed by he saw levi the son of alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom and said unto him follow me and he arose and followed him 215 and it came to pass that as jesus sat at meat in his house many publicans and sinners sat also together with jesus and his disciples for there were many and they followed him 216 and when the scribes and pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners they said unto his disciples how is it that he eateth and drinketh with publicans and sinners 217 when jesus heard it he saith unto them they that are whole have no need of the physician but they that are sick i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance 218 and the disciples of john and of the pharisees used to fast and they come and say unto him why do the disciples of john and of the pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not 219 and jesus said unto them can the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast 220 but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days 221 no man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old and the rent is made worse 222 and no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine doth burst the bottles and the wine is spilled and the bottles will be marred but new wine must be put into new bottles 223 and it came to pass that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day and his disciples began as they went to pluck the ears of corn 224 and the pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful 225 and he said unto them have ye never read what david did when he had need and was an hungred he and they that were with him 226 how he went into the house of god in the days of abiathar the high priest and did eat the shewbread which is not lawful to eat but for the priests and gave also to them which were with him 227 and he said unto them the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath 228 therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath 31 and he entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there which had a withered hand 32 and they watched him whether he would heal him on the sabbath day that they might accuse him 33 and he saith unto the man which had the withered hand stand forth 34 and he saith unto them is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days or to do evil to save life or to kill but they held their peace 35 and when he had looked round about on them with anger being grieved for the hardness of their hearts he saith unto the man stretch forth thine hand and he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the other 36 and the pharisees went forth and straightway took counsel with the herodians against him how they might destroy him 37 but jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea and a great multitude from galilee followed him and from judaea 38 and from jerusalem and from idumaea and from beyond jordan and they about tyre and sidon a great multitude when they had heard what great things he did came unto him 39 and he spake to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude lest they should throng him 310 for he had healed many insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him as many as had plagues 311 and unclean spirits when they saw him fell down before him and cried saying thou art the son of god 312 and he straitly charged them that they should not make him known 313 and he goeth up into a mountain and calleth unto him whom he would and they came unto him 314 and he ordained twelve that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach 315 and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils 316 and simon he surnamed peter 317 and james the son of zebedee and john the brother of james and he surnamed them boanerges which is the sons of thunder 318 and andrew and philip and bartholomew and matthew and thomas and james the son of alphaeus and thaddaeus and simon the canaanite 319 and judas iscariot which also betrayed him and they went into an house 320 and the multitude cometh together again so that they could not so much as eat bread 321 and when his friends heard of it they went out to lay hold on him for they said he is beside himself 322 and the scribes which came down from jerusalem said he hath beelzebub and by the prince of the devils casteth he out devils 323 and he called them unto him and said unto them in parables how can satan cast out satan 324 and if a kingdom be divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand 325 and if a house be divided against itself that house cannot stand 326 and if satan rise up against himself and be divided he cannot stand but hath an end 327 no man can enter into a strong mans house and spoil his goods except he will first bind the strong man and then he will spoil his house 328 verily i say unto you all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme 329 but he that shall blaspheme against the holy ghost hath never forgiveness but is in danger of eternal damnation 330 because they said he hath an unclean spirit 331 there came then his brethren and his mother and standing without sent unto him calling him 332 and the multitude sat about him and they said unto him behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee 333 and he answered them saying who is my mother or my brethren 334 and he looked round about on them which sat about him and said behold my mother and my brethren 335 for whosoever shall do the will of god the same is my brother and my sister and mother 41 and he began again to teach by the sea side and there was gathered unto him a great multitude so that he entered into a ship and sat in the sea and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land 42 and he taught them many things by parables and said unto them in his doctrine 43 hearken behold there went out a sower to sow 44 and it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the way side and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up 45 and some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth 46 but when the sun was up it was scorched and because it had no root it withered away 47 and some fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it and it yielded no fruit 48 and other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth some thirty and some sixty and some an hundred 49 and he said unto them he that hath ears to hear let him hear 410 and when he was alone they that were about him with the twelve asked of him the parable 411 and he said unto them unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of god but unto them that are without all these things are done in parables 412 that seeing they may see and not perceive and hearing they may hear and not understand lest at any time they should be converted and their sins should be forgiven them 413 and he said unto them know ye not this parable and how then will ye know all parables 414 the sower soweth the word 415 and these are they by the way side where the word is sown but when they have heard satan cometh immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts 416 and these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness 417 and have no root in themselves and so endure but for a time afterward when affliction or persecution ariseth for the words sake immediately they are offended 418 and these are they which are sown among thorns such as hear the word 419 and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word and it becometh unfruitful 420 and these are they which are sown on good ground such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit some thirtyfold some sixty and some an hundred 421 and he said unto them is a candle brought to be put under a bushel or under a bed and not to be set on a candlestick 422 for there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested neither was any thing kept secret but that it should come abroad 423 if any man have ears to hear let him hear 424 and he said unto them take heed what ye hear with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you and unto you that hear shall more be given 425 for he that hath to him shall be given and he that hath not from him shall be taken even that which he hath 426 and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed into the ground 427 and should sleep and rise night and day and the seed should spring and grow up he knoweth not how 428 for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that the full corn in the ear 429 but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because the harvest is come 430 and he said whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of god or with what comparison shall we compare it 431 it is like a grain of mustard seed which when it is sown in the earth is less than all the seeds that be in the earth 432 but when it is sown it groweth up and becometh greater than all herbs and shooteth out great branches so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it 433 and with many such parables spake he the word unto them as they were able to hear it 434 but without a parable spake he not unto them and when they were alone he expounded all things to his disciples 435 and the same day when the even was come he saith unto them let us pass over unto the other side 436 and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships 437 and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full 438 and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and say unto him master carest thou not that we perish 439 and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm 440 and he said unto them why are ye so fearful how is it that ye have no faith 441 and they feared exceedingly and said one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the sea obey him 51 and they came over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the gadarenes 52 and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit 53 who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains 54 because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him 55 and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones 56 but when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him 57 and cried with a loud voice and said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god i adjure thee by god that thou torment me not 58 for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit 59 and he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is legion for we are many 510 and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country 511 now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding 512 and all the devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them 513 and forthwith jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea they were about two thousand and were choked in the sea 514 and they that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country and they went out to see what it was that was done 515 and they come to jesus and see him that was possessed with the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid 516 and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil and also concerning the swine 517 and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts 518 and when he was come into the ship he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him 519 howbeit jesus suffered him not but saith unto him go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee and hath had compassion on thee 520 and he departed and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him and all men did marvel 521 and when jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side much people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the sea 522 and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue jairus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet 523 and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lieth at the point of death i pray thee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she shall live 524 and jesus went with him and much people followed him and thronged him 525 and a certain woman which had an issue of blood twelve years 526 and had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse 527 when she had heard of jesus came in the press behind and touched his garment 528 for she said if i may touch but his clothes i shall be whole 529 and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague 530 and jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes 531 and his disciples said unto him thou seest the multitude thronging thee and sayest thou who touched me 532 and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing 533 but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth 534 and he said unto her daughter thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague 535 while he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogues house certain which said thy daughter is dead why troublest thou the master any further 536 as soon as jesus heard the word that was spoken he saith unto the ruler of the synagogue be not afraid only believe 537 and he suffered no man to follow him save peter and james and john the brother of james 538 and he cometh to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and seeth the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly 539 and when he was come in he saith unto them why make ye this ado and weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth 540 and they laughed him to scorn but when he had put them all out he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with him and entereth in where the damsel was lying 541 and he took the damsel by the hand and said unto her talitha cumi which is being interpreted damsel i say unto thee arise 542 and straightway the damsel arose and walked for she was of the age of twelve years and they were astonished with a great astonishment 543 and he charged them straitly that no man should know it and commanded that something should be given her to eat 61 and he went out from thence and came into his own country and his disciples follow him 62 and when the sabbath day was come he began to teach in the synagogue and many hearing him were astonished saying from whence hath this man these things and what wisdom is this which is given unto him that even such mighty works are wrought by his hands 63 is not this the carpenter the son of mary the brother of james and joses and of juda and simon and are not his sisters here with us and they were offended at him 64 but jesus said unto them a prophet is not without honour but in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house 65 and he could there do no mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them 66 and he marvelled because of their unbelief and he went round about the villages teaching 67 and he called unto him the twelve and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them power over unclean spirits 68 and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey save a staff only no scrip no bread no money in their purse 69 but be shod with sandals and not put on two coats 610 and he said unto them in what place soever ye enter into an house there abide till ye depart from that place 611 and whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you when ye depart thence shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony against them verily i say unto you it shall be more tolerable for sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city 612 and they went out and preached that men should repent 613 and they cast out many devils and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them 614 and king herod heard of him for his name was spread abroad and he said that john the baptist was risen from the dead and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him 615 others said that it is elias and others said that it is a prophet or as one of the prophets 616 but when herod heard thereof he said it is john whom i beheaded he is risen from the dead 617 for herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon john and bound him in prison for herodias sake his brother philips wife for he had married her 618 for john had said unto herod it is not lawful for thee to have thy brothers wife 619 therefore herodias had a quarrel against him and would have killed him but she could not 620 for herod feared john knowing that he was a just man and an holy and observed him and when he heard him he did many things and heard him gladly 621 and when a convenient day was come that herod on his birthday made a supper to his lords high captains and chief estates of galilee 622 and when the daughter of the said herodias came in and danced and pleased herod and them that sat with him the king said unto the damsel ask of me whatsoever thou wilt and i will give it thee 623 and he sware unto her whatsoever thou shalt ask of me i will give it thee unto the half of my kingdom 624 and she went forth and said unto her mother what shall i ask and she said the head of john the baptist 625 and she came in straightway with haste unto the king and asked saying i will that thou give me by and by in a charger the head of john the baptist 626 and the king was exceeding sorry yet for his oaths sake and for their sakes which sat with him he would not reject her 627 and immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought and he went and beheaded him in the prison 628 and brought his head in a charger and gave it to the damsel and the damsel gave it to her mother 629 and when his disciples heard of it they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb 630 and the apostles gathered themselves together unto jesus and told him all things both what they had done and what they had taught 631 and he said unto them come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while for there were many coming and going and they had no leisure so much as to eat 632 and they departed into a desert place by ship privately 633 and the people saw them departing and many knew him and ran afoot thither out of all cities and outwent them and came together unto him 634 and jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things 635 and when the day was now far spent his disciples came unto him and said this is a desert place and now the time is far passed 636 send them away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and buy themselves bread for they have nothing to eat 637 he answered and said unto them give ye them to eat and they say unto him shall we go and buy two hundred pennyworth of bread and give them to eat 638 he saith unto them how many loaves have ye go and see and when they knew they say five and two fishes 639 and he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass 640 and they sat down in ranks by hundreds and by fifties 641 and when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes he looked up to heaven and blessed and brake the loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before them and the two fishes divided he among them all 642 and they did all eat and were filled 643 and they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes 644 and they that did eat of the loaves were about five thousand men 645 and straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship and to go to the other side before unto bethsaida while he sent away the people 646 and when he had sent them away he departed into a mountain to pray 647 and when even was come the ship was in the midst of the sea and he alone on the land 648 and he saw them toiling in rowing for the wind was contrary unto them and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh unto them walking upon the sea and would have passed by them 649 but when they saw him walking upon the sea they supposed it had been a spirit and cried out 650 for they all saw him and were troubled and immediately he talked with them and saith unto them be of good cheer it is i be not afraid 651 and he went up unto them into the ship and the wind ceased and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered 652 for they considered not the miracle of the loaves for their heart was hardened 653 and when they had passed over they came into the land of gennesaret and drew to the shore 654 and when they were come out of the ship straightway they knew him 655 and ran through that whole region round about and began to carry about in beds those that were sick where they heard he was 656 and whithersoever he entered into villages or cities or country they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment and as many as touched him were made whole 71 then came together unto him the pharisees and certain of the scribes which came from jerusalem 72 and when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled that is to say with unwashen hands they found fault 73 for the pharisees and all the jews except they wash their hands oft eat not holding the tradition of the elders 74 and when they come from the market except they wash they eat not and many other things there be which they have received to hold as the washing of cups and pots brasen vessels and of tables 75 then the pharisees and scribes asked him why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashen hands 76 he answered and said unto them well hath esaias prophesied of you hypocrites as it is written this people honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me 77 howbeit in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men 78 for laying aside the commandment of god ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such like things ye do 79 and he said unto them full well ye reject the commandment of god that ye may keep your own tradition 710 for moses said honour thy father and thy mother and whoso curseth father or mother let him die the death 711 but ye say if a man shall say to his father or mother it is corban that is to say a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me he shall be free 712 and ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother 713 making the word of god of none effect through your tradition which ye have delivered and many such like things do ye 714 and when he had called all the people unto him he said unto them hearken unto me every one of you and understand 715 there is nothing from without a man that entering into him can defile him but the things which come out of him those are they that defile the man 716 if any man have ears to hear let him hear 717 and when he was entered into the house from the people his disciples asked him concerning the parable 718 and he saith unto them are ye so without understanding also do ye not perceive that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man it cannot defile him 719 because it entereth not into his heart but into the belly and goeth out into the draught purging all meats 720 and he said that which cometh out of the man that defileth the man 721 for from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts adulteries fornications murders 722 thefts covetousness wickedness deceit lasciviousness an evil eye blasphemy pride foolishness 723 all these evil things come from within and defile the man 724 and from thence he arose and went into the borders of tyre and sidon and entered into an house and would have no man know it but he could not be hid 725 for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet 726 the woman was a greek a syrophenician by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter 727 but jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not meet to take the childrens bread and to cast it unto the dogs 728 and she answered and said unto him yes lord yet the dogs under the table eat of the childrens crumbs 729 and he said unto her for this saying go thy way the devil is gone out of thy daughter 730 and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out and her daughter laid upon the bed 731 and again departing from the coasts of tyre and sidon he came unto the sea of galilee through the midst of the coasts of decapolis 732 and they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech and they beseech him to put his hand upon him 733 and he took him aside from the multitude and put his fingers into his ears and he spit and touched his tongue 734 and looking up to heaven he sighed and saith unto him ephphatha that is be opened 735 and straightway his ears were opened and the string of his tongue was loosed and he spake plain 736 and he charged them that they should tell no man but the more he charged them so much the more a great deal they published it 737 and were beyond measure astonished saying he hath done all things well he maketh both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak 81 in those days the multitude being very great and having nothing to eat jesus called his disciples unto him and saith unto them 82 i have compassion on the multitude because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat 83 and if i send them away fasting to their own houses they will faint by the way for divers of them came from far 84 and his disciples answered him from whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness 85 and he asked them how many loaves have ye and they said seven 86 and he commanded the people to sit down on the ground and he took the seven loaves and gave thanks and brake and gave to his disciples to set before them and they did set them before the people 87 and they had a few small fishes and he blessed and commanded to set them also before them 88 so they did eat and were filled and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets 89 and they that had eaten were about four thousand and he sent them away 810 and straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples and came into the parts of dalmanutha 811 and the pharisees came forth and began to question with him seeking of him a sign from heaven tempting him 812 and he sighed deeply in his spirit and saith why doth this generation seek after a sign verily i say unto you there shall no sign be given unto this generation 813 and he left them and entering into the ship again departed to the other side 814 now the disciples had forgotten to take bread neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf 815 and he charged them saying take heed beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the leaven of herod 816 and they reasoned among themselves saying it is because we have no bread 817 and when jesus knew it he saith unto them why reason ye because ye have no bread perceive ye not yet neither understand have ye your heart yet hardened 818 having eyes see ye not and having ears hear ye not and do ye not remember 819 when i brake the five loaves among five thousand how many baskets full of fragments took ye up they say unto him twelve 820 and when the seven among four thousand how many baskets full of fragments took ye up and they said seven 821 and he said unto them how is it that ye do not understand 822 and he cometh to bethsaida and they bring a blind man unto him and besought him to touch him 823 and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town and when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him he asked him if he saw ought 824 and he looked up and said i see men as trees walking 825 after that he put his hands again upon his eyes and made him look up and he was restored and saw every man clearly 826 and he sent him away to his house saying neither go into the town nor tell it to any in the town 827 and jesus went out and his disciples into the towns of caesarea philippi and by the way he asked his disciples saying unto them whom do men say that i am 828 and they answered john the baptist but some say elias and others one of the prophets 829 and he saith unto them but whom say ye that i am and peter answereth and saith unto him thou art the christ 830 and he charged them that they should tell no man of him 831 and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the chief priests and scribes and be killed and after three days rise again 832 and he spake that saying openly and peter took him and began to rebuke him 833 but when he had turned about and looked on his disciples he rebuked peter saying get thee behind me satan for thou savourest not the things that be of god but the things that be of men 834 and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me 835 for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it 836 for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul 837 or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul 838 whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels 91 and he said unto them verily i say unto you that there be some of them that stand here which shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of god come with power 92 and after six days jesus taketh with him peter and james and john and leadeth them up into an high mountain apart by themselves and he was transfigured before them 93 and his raiment became shining exceeding white as snow so as no fuller on earth can white them 94 and there appeared unto them elias with moses and they were talking with jesus 95 and peter answered and said to jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias 96 for he wist not what to say for they were sore afraid 97 and there was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him 98 and suddenly when they had looked round about they saw no man any more save jesus only with themselves 99 and as they came down from the mountain he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen till the son of man were risen from the dead 910 and they kept that saying with themselves questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should mean 911 and they asked him saying why say the scribes that elias must first come 912 and he answered and told them elias verily cometh first and restoreth all things and how it is written of the son of man that he must suffer many things and be set at nought 913 but i say unto you that elias is indeed come and they have done unto him whatsoever they listed as it is written of him 914 and when he came to his disciples he saw a great multitude about them and the scribes questioning with them 915 and straightway all the people when they beheld him were greatly amazed and running to him saluted him 916 and he asked the scribes what question ye with them 917 and one of the multitude answered and said master i have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit 918 and wheresoever he taketh him he teareth him and he foameth and gnasheth with his teeth and pineth away and i spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not 919 he answereth him and saith o faithless generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me 920 and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tare him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming 921 and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto him and he said of a child 922 and ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou canst do any thing have compassion on us and help us 923 jesus said unto him if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth 924 and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears lord i believe help thou mine unbelief 925 when jesus saw that the people came running together he rebuked the foul spirit saying unto him thou dumb and deaf spirit i charge thee come out of him and enter no more into him 926 and the spirit cried and rent him sore and came out of him and he was as one dead insomuch that many said he is dead 927 but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up and he arose 928 and when he was come into the house his disciples asked him privately why could not we cast him out 929 and he said unto them this kind can come forth by nothing but by prayer and fasting 930 and they departed thence and passed through galilee and he would not that any man should know it 931 for he taught his disciples and said unto them the son of man is delivered into the hands of men and they shall kill him and after that he is killed he shall rise the third day 932 but they understood not that saying and were afraid to ask him 933 and he came to capernaum and being in the house he asked them what was it that ye disputed among yourselves by the way 934 but they held their peace for by the way they had disputed among themselves who should be the greatest 935 and he sat down and called the twelve and saith unto them if any man desire to be first the same shall be last of all and servant of all 936 and he took a child and set him in the midst of them and when he had taken him in his arms he said unto them 937 whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth not me but him that sent me 938 and john answered him saying master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and he followeth not us and we forbad him because he followeth not us 939 but jesus said forbid him not for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me 940 for he that is not against us is on our part 941 for whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because ye belong to christ verily i say unto you he shall not lose his reward 942 and whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea 943 and if thy hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched 944 where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched 945 and if thy foot offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched 946 where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched 947 and if thine eye offend thee pluck it out it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of god with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire 948 where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched 949 for every one shall be salted with fire and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt 950 salt is good but if the salt have lost his saltness wherewith will ye season it have salt in yourselves and have peace one with another 101 and he arose from thence and cometh into the coasts of judaea by the farther side of jordan and the people resort unto him again and as he was wont he taught them again 102 and the pharisees came to him and asked him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife tempting him 103 and he answered and said unto them what did moses command you 104 and they said moses suffered to write a bill of divorcement and to put her away 105 and jesus answered and said unto them for the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept 106 but from the beginning of the creation god made them male and female 107 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife 108 and they twain shall be one flesh so then they are no more twain but one flesh 109 what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder 1010 and in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter 1011 and he saith unto them whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another committeth adultery against her 1012 and if a woman shall put away her husband and be married to another she committeth adultery 1013 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them 1014 but when jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god 1015 verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child he shall not enter therein 1016 and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and blessed them 1017 and when he was gone forth into the way there came one running and kneeled to him and asked him good master what shall i do that i may inherit eternal life 1018 and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is god 1019 thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness defraud not honour thy father and mother 1020 and he answered and said unto him master all these have i observed from my youth 1021 then jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou hast and give to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come take up the cross and follow me 1022 and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions 1023 and jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god 1024 and the disciples were astonished at his words but jesus answereth again and saith unto them children how hard is it for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of god 1025 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god 1026 and they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves who then can be saved 1027 and jesus looking upon them saith with men it is impossible but not with god for with god all things are possible 1028 then peter began to say unto him lo we have left all and have followed thee 1029 and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels 1030 but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life 1031 but many that are first shall be last and the last first 1032 and they were in the way going up to jerusalem and jesus went before them and they were amazed and as they followed they were afraid and he took again the twelve and began to tell them what things should happen unto him 1033 saying behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be delivered unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles 1034 and they shall mock him and shall scourge him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him and the third day he shall rise again 1035 and james and john the sons of zebedee come unto him saying master we would that thou shouldest do for us whatsoever we shall desire 1036 and he said unto them what would ye that i should do for you 1037 they said unto him grant unto us that we may sit one on thy right hand and the other on thy left hand in thy glory 1038 but jesus said unto them ye know not what ye ask can ye drink of the cup that i drink of and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with 1039 and they said unto him we can and jesus said unto them ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of and with the baptism that i am baptized withal shall ye be baptized 1040 but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared 1041 and when the ten heard it they began to be much displeased with james and john 1042 but jesus called them to him and saith unto them ye know that they which are accounted to rule over the gentiles exercise lordship over them and their great ones exercise authority upon them 1043 but so shall it not be among you but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister 1044 and whosoever of you will be the chiefest shall be servant of all 1045 for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many 1046 and they came to jericho and as he went out of jericho with his disciples and a great number of people blind bartimaeus the son of timaeus sat by the highway side begging 1047 and when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me 1048 and many charged him that he should hold his peace but he cried the more a great deal thou son of david have mercy on me 1049 and jesus stood still and commanded him to be called and they call the blind man saying unto him be of good comfort rise he calleth thee 1050 and he casting away his garment rose and came to jesus 1051 and jesus answered and said unto him what wilt thou that i should do unto thee the blind man said unto him lord that i might receive my sight 1052 and jesus said unto him go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole and immediately he received his sight and followed jesus in the way 111 and when they came nigh to jerusalem unto bethphage and bethany at the mount of olives he sendeth forth two of his disciples 112 and saith unto them go your way into the village over against you and as soon as ye be entered into it ye shall find a colt tied whereon never man sat loose him and bring him 113 and if any man say unto you why do ye this say ye that the lord hath need of him and straightway he will send him hither 114 and they went their way and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met and they loose him 115 and certain of them that stood there said unto them what do ye loosing the colt 116 and they said unto them even as jesus had commanded and they let them go 117 and they brought the colt to jesus and cast their garments on him and he sat upon him 118 and many spread their garments in the way and others cut down branches off the trees and strawed them in the way 119 and they that went before and they that followed cried saying hosanna blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord 1110 blessed be the kingdom of our father david that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest 1111 and jesus entered into jerusalem and into the temple and when he had looked round about upon all things and now the eventide was come he went out unto bethany with the twelve 1112 and on the morrow when they were come from bethany he was hungry 1113 and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves he came if haply he might find any thing thereon and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet 1114 and jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever and his disciples heard it 1115 and they come to jerusalem and jesus went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of them that sold doves 1116 and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple 1117 and he taught saying unto them is it not written my house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves 1118 and the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy him for they feared him because all the people was astonished at his doctrine 1119 and when even was come he went out of the city 1120 and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots 1121 and peter calling to remembrance saith unto him master behold the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away 1122 and jesus answering saith unto them have faith in god 1123 for verily i say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith 1124 therefore i say unto you what things soever ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them 1125 and when ye stand praying forgive if ye have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses 1126 but if ye do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses 1127 and they come again to jerusalem and as he was walking in the temple there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the elders 1128 and say unto him by what authority doest thou these things and who gave thee this authority to do these things 1129 and jesus answered and said unto them i will also ask of you one question and answer me and i will tell you by what authority i do these things 1130 the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men answer me 1131 and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why then did ye not believe him 1132 but if we shall say of men they feared the people for all men counted john that he was a prophet indeed 1133 and they answered and said unto jesus we cannot tell and jesus answering saith unto them neither do i tell you by what authority i do these things 121 and he began to speak unto them by parables a certain man planted a vineyard and set an hedge about it and digged a place for the winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country 122 and at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard 123 and they caught him and beat him and sent him away empty 124 and again he sent unto them another servant and at him they cast stones and wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully handled 125 and again he sent another and him they killed and many others beating some and killing some 126 having yet therefore one son his wellbeloved he sent him also last unto them saying they will reverence my son 127 but those husbandmen said among themselves this is the heir come let us kill him and the inheritance shall be ours 128 and they took him and killed him and cast him out of the vineyard 129 what shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do he will come and destroy the husbandmen and will give the vineyard unto others 1210 and have ye not read this scripture the stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner 1211 this was the lords doing and it is marvellous in our eyes 1212 and they sought to lay hold on him but feared the people for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them and they left him and went their way 1213 and they send unto him certain of the pharisees and of the herodians to catch him in his words 1214 and when they were come they say unto him master we know that thou art true and carest for no man for thou regardest not the person of men but teachest the way of god in truth is it lawful to give tribute to caesar or not 1215 shall we give or shall we not give but he knowing their hypocrisy said unto them why tempt ye me bring me a penny that i may see it 1216 and they brought it and he saith unto them whose is this image and superscription and they said unto him caesars 1217 and jesus answering said unto them render to caesar the things that are caesars and to god the things that are gods and they marvelled at him 1218 then come unto him the sadducees which say there is no resurrection and they asked him saying 1219 master moses wrote unto us if a mans brother die and leave his wife behind him and leave no children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother 1220 now there were seven brethren and the first took a wife and dying left no seed 1221 and the second took her and died neither left he any seed and the third likewise 1222 and the seven had her and left no seed last of all the woman died also 1223 in the resurrection therefore when they shall rise whose wife shall she be of them for the seven had her to wife 1224 and jesus answering said unto them do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures neither the power of god 1225 for when they shall rise from the dead they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are as the angels which are in heaven 1226 and as touching the dead that they rise have ye not read in the book of moses how in the bush god spake unto him saying i am the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob 1227 he is not the god of the dead but the god of the living ye therefore do greatly err 1228 and one of the scribes came and having heard them reasoning together and perceiving that he had answered them well asked him which is the first commandment of all 1229 and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o israel the lord our god is one lord 1230 and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment 1231 and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these 1232 and the scribe said unto him well master thou hast said the truth for there is one god and there is none other but he 1233 and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbour as himself is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices 1234 and when jesus saw that he answered discreetly he said unto him thou art not far from the kingdom of god and no man after that durst ask him any question 1235 and jesus answered and said while he taught in the temple how say the scribes that christ is the son of david 1236 for david himself said by the holy ghost the lord said to my lord sit thou on my right hand till i make thine enemies thy footstool 1237 david therefore himself calleth him lord and whence is he then his son and the common people heard him gladly 1238 and he said unto them in his doctrine beware of the scribes which love to go in long clothing and love salutations in the marketplaces 1239 and the chief seats in the synagogues and the uppermost rooms at feasts 1240 which devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayers these shall receive greater damnation 1241 and jesus sat over against the treasury and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury and many that were rich cast in much 1242 and there came a certain poor widow and she threw in two mites which make a farthing 1243 and he called unto him his disciples and saith unto them verily i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury 1244 for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living 131 and as he went out of the temple one of his disciples saith unto him master see what manner of stones and what buildings are here 132 and jesus answering said unto him seest thou these great buildings there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down 133 and as he sat upon the mount of olives over against the temple peter and james and john and andrew asked him privately 134 tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled 135 and jesus answering them began to say take heed lest any man deceive you 136 for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many 137 and when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars be ye not troubled for such things must needs be but the end shall not be yet 138 for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be earthquakes in divers places and there shall be famines and troubles these are the beginnings of sorrows 139 but take heed to yourselves for they shall deliver you up to councils and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten and ye shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony against them 1310 and the gospel must first be published among all nations 1311 but when they shall lead you and deliver you up take no thought beforehand what ye shall speak neither do ye premeditate but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak ye for it is not ye that speak but the holy ghost 1312 now the brother shall betray the brother to death and the father the son and children shall rise up against their parents and shall cause them to be put to death 1313 and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved 1314 but when ye shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet standing where it ought not let him that readeth understand then let them that be in judaea flee to the mountains 1315 and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house neither enter therein to take any thing out of his house 1316 and let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment 1317 but woe to them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days 1318 and pray ye that your flight be not in the winter 1319 for in those days shall be affliction such as was not from the beginning of the creation which god created unto this time neither shall be 1320 and except that the lord had shortened those days no flesh should be saved but for the elects sake whom he hath chosen he hath shortened the days 1321 and then if any man shall say to you lo here is christ or lo he is there believe him not 1322 for false christs and false prophets shall rise and shall shew signs and wonders to seduce if it were possible even the elect 1323 but take ye heed behold i have foretold you all things 1324 but in those days after that tribulation the sun shall be darkened and the moon shall not give her light 1325 and the stars of heaven shall fall and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken 1326 and then shall they see the son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory 1327 and then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven 1328 now learn a parable of the fig tree when her branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know that summer is near 1329 so ye in like manner when ye shall see these things come to pass know that it is nigh even at the doors 1330 verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done 1331 heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away 1332 but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father 1333 take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is 1334 for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch 1335 watch ye therefore for ye know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight or at the cockcrowing or in the morning 1336 lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping 1337 and what i say unto you i say unto all watch 141 after two days was the feast of the passover and of unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft and put him to death 142 but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar of the people 143 and being in bethany in the house of simon the leper as he sat at meat there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious and she brake the box and poured it on his head 144 and there were some that had indignation within themselves and said why was this waste of the ointment made 145 for it might have been sold for more than three hundred pence and have been given to the poor and they murmured against her 146 and jesus said let her alone why trouble ye her she hath wrought a good work on me 147 for ye have the poor with you always and whensoever ye will ye may do them good but me ye have not always 148 she hath done what she could she is come aforehand to anoint my body to the burying 149 verily i say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her 1410 and judas iscariot one of the twelve went unto the chief priests to betray him unto them 1411 and when they heard it they were glad and promised to give him money and he sought how he might conveniently betray him 1412 and the first day of unleavened bread when they killed the passover his disciples said unto him where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayest eat the passover 1413 and he sendeth forth two of his disciples and saith unto them go ye into the city and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water follow him 1414 and wheresoever he shall go in say ye to the goodman of the house the master saith where is the guestchamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples 1415 and he will shew you a large upper room furnished and prepared there make ready for us 1416 and his disciples went forth and came into the city and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover 1417 and in the evening he cometh with the twelve 1418 and as they sat and did eat jesus said verily i say unto you one of you which eateth with me shall betray me 1419 and they began to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one is it i and another said is it i 1420 and he answered and said unto them it is one of the twelve that dippeth with me in the dish 1421 the son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him but woe to that man by whom the son of man is betrayed good were it for that man if he had never been born 1422 and as they did eat jesus took bread and blessed and brake it and gave to them and said take eat this is my body 1423 and he took the cup and when he had given thanks he gave it to them and they all drank of it 1424 and he said unto them this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many 1425 verily i say unto you i will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that i drink it new in the kingdom of god 1426 and when they had sung an hymn they went out into the mount of olives 1427 and jesus saith unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written i will smite the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered 1428 but after that i am risen i will go before you into galilee 1429 but peter said unto him although all shall be offended yet will not i 1430 and jesus saith unto him verily i say unto thee that this day even in this night before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice 1431 but he spake the more vehemently if i should die with thee i will not deny thee in any wise likewise also said they all 1432 and they came to a place which was named gethsemane and he saith to his disciples sit ye here while i shall pray 1433 and he taketh with him peter and james and john and began to be sore amazed and to be very heavy 1434 and saith unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death tarry ye here and watch 1435 and he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him 1436 and he said abba father all things are possible unto thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what i will but what thou wilt 1437 and he cometh and findeth them sleeping and saith unto peter simon sleepest thou couldest not thou watch one hour 1438 watch ye and pray lest ye enter into temptation the spirit truly is ready but the flesh is weak 1439 and again he went away and prayed and spake the same words 1440 and when he returned he found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy neither wist they what to answer him 1441 and he cometh the third time and saith unto them sleep on now and take your rest it is enough the hour is come behold the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners 1442 rise up let us go lo he that betrayeth me is at hand 1443 and immediately while he yet spake cometh judas one of the twelve and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders 1444 and he that betrayed him had given them a token saying whomsoever i shall kiss that same is he take him and lead him away safely 1445 and as soon as he was come he goeth straightway to him and saith master master and kissed him 1446 and they laid their hands on him and took him 1447 and one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote a servant of the high priest and cut off his ear 1448 and jesus answered and said unto them are ye come out as against a thief with swords and with staves to take me 1449 i was daily with you in the temple teaching and ye took me not but the scriptures must be fulfilled 1450 and they all forsook him and fled 1451 and there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth cast about his naked body and the young men laid hold on him 1452 and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked 1453 and they led jesus away to the high priest and with him were assembled all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes 1454 and peter followed him afar off even into the palace of the high priest and he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire 1455 and the chief priests and all the council sought for witness against jesus to put him to death and found none 1456 for many bare false witness against him but their witness agreed not together 1457 and there arose certain and bare false witness against him saying 1458 we heard him say i will destroy this temple that is made with hands and within three days i will build another made without hands 1459 but neither so did their witness agree together 1460 and the high priest stood up in the midst and asked jesus saying answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee 1461 but he held his peace and answered nothing again the high priest asked him and said unto him art thou the christ the son of the blessed 1462 and jesus said i am and ye shall see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven 1463 then the high priest rent his clothes and saith what need we any further witnesses 1464 ye have heard the blasphemy what think ye and they all condemned him to be guilty of death 1465 and some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him prophesy and the servants did strike him with the palms of their hands 1466 and as peter was beneath in the palace there cometh one of the maids of the high priest 1467 and when she saw peter warming himself she looked upon him and said and thou also wast with jesus of nazareth 1468 but he denied saying i know not neither understand i what thou sayest and he went out into the porch and the cock crew 1469 and a maid saw him again and began to say to them that stood by this is one of them 1470 and he denied it again and a little after they that stood by said again to peter surely thou art one of them for thou art a galilaean and thy speech agreeth thereto 1471 but he began to curse and to swear saying i know not this man of whom ye speak 1472 and the second time the cock crew and peter called to mind the word that jesus said unto him before the cock crow twice thou shalt deny me thrice and when he thought thereon he wept 151 and straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council and bound jesus and carried him away and delivered him to pilate 152 and pilate asked him art thou the king of the jews and he answering said unto them thou sayest it 153 and the chief priests accused him of many things but he answered nothing 154 and pilate asked him again saying answerest thou nothing behold how many things they witness against thee 155 but jesus yet answered nothing so that pilate marvelled 156 now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner whomsoever they desired 157 and there was one named barabbas which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him who had committed murder in the insurrection 158 and the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them 159 but pilate answered them saying will ye that i release unto you the king of the jews 1510 for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy 1511 but the chief priests moved the people that he should rather release barabbas unto them 1512 and pilate answered and said again unto them what will ye then that i shall do unto him whom ye call the king of the jews 1513 and they cried out again crucify him 1514 then pilate said unto them why what evil hath he done and they cried out the more exceedingly crucify him 1515 and so pilate willing to content the people released barabbas unto them and delivered jesus when he had scourged him to be crucified 1516 and the soldiers led him away into the hall called praetorium and they call together the whole band 1517 and they clothed him with purple and platted a crown of thorns and put it about his head 1518 and began to salute him hail king of the jews 1519 and they smote him on the head with a reed and did spit upon him and bowing their knees worshipped him 1520 and when they had mocked him they took off the purple from him and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him 1521 and they compel one simon a cyrenian who passed by coming out of the country the father of alexander and rufus to bear his cross 1522 and they bring him unto the place golgotha which is being interpreted the place of a skull 1523 and they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh but he received it not 1524 and when they had crucified him they parted his garments casting lots upon them what every man should take 1525 and it was the third hour and they crucified him 1526 and the superscription of his accusation was written over the king of the jews 1527 and with him they crucify two thieves the one on his right hand and the other on his left 1528 and the scripture was fulfilled which saith and he was numbered with the transgressors 1529 and they that passed by railed on him wagging their heads and saying ah thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days 1530 save thyself and come down from the cross 1531 likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes he saved others himself he cannot save 1532 let christ the king of israel descend now from the cross that we may see and believe and they that were crucified with him reviled him 1533 and when the sixth hour was come there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour 1534 and at the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eloi eloi lama sabachthani which is being interpreted my god my god why hast thou forsaken me 1535 and some of them that stood by when they heard it said behold he calleth elias 1536 and one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink saying let alone let us see whether elias will come to take him down 1537 and jesus cried with a loud voice and gave up the ghost 1538 and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom 1539 and when the centurion which stood over against him saw that he so cried out and gave up the ghost he said truly this man was the son of god 1540 there were also women looking on afar off among whom was mary magdalene and mary the mother of james the less and of joses and salome 1541 who also when he was in galilee followed him and ministered unto him and many other women which came up with him unto jerusalem 1542 and now when the even was come because it was the preparation that is the day before the sabbath 1543 joseph of arimathaea an honourable counsellor which also waited for the kingdom of god came and went in boldly unto pilate and craved the body of jesus 1544 and pilate marvelled if he were already dead and calling unto him the centurion he asked him whether he had been any while dead 1545 and when he knew it of the centurion he gave the body to joseph 1546 and he bought fine linen and took him down and wrapped him in the linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre 1547 and mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses beheld where he was laid 161 and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him 162 and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun 163 and they said among themselves who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre 164 and when they looked they saw that the stone was rolled away for it was very great 165 and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted 166 and he saith unto them be not affrighted ye seek jesus of nazareth which was crucified he is risen he is not here behold the place where they laid him 167 but go your way tell his disciples and peter that he goeth before you into galilee there shall ye see him as he said unto you 168 and they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre for they trembled and were amazed neither said they any thing to any man for they were afraid 169 now when jesus was risen early the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had cast seven devils 1610 and she went and told them that had been with him as they mourned and wept 1611 and they when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her believed not 1612 after that he appeared in another form unto two of them as they walked and went into the country 1613 and they went and told it unto the residue neither believed they them 1614 afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen 1615 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature 1616 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned 1617 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues 1618 they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover 1619 so then after the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god 1620 and they went forth and preached every where the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen the gospel according to saint luke 11 forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us 12 even as they delivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word 13 it seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent theophilus 14 that thou mightest know the certainty of those things wherein thou hast been instructed 15 there was in the days of herod the king of judaea a certain priest named zacharias of the course of abia and his wife was of the daughters of aaron and her name was elisabeth 16 and they were both righteous before god walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the lord blameless 17 and they had no child because that elisabeth was barren and they both were now well stricken in years 18 and it came to pass that while he executed the priests office before god in the order of his course 19 according to the custom of the priests office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the lord 110 and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense 111 and there appeared unto him an angel of the lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense 112 and when zacharias saw him he was troubled and fear fell upon him 113 but the angel said unto him fear not zacharias for thy prayer is heard and thy wife elisabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john 114 and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth 115 for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mothers womb 116 and many of the children of israel shall he turn to the lord their god 117 and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord 118 and zacharias said unto the angel whereby shall i know this for i am an old man and my wife well stricken in years 119 and the angel answering said unto him i am gabriel that stand in the presence of god and am sent to speak unto thee and to shew thee these glad tidings 120 and behold thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed because thou believest not my words which shall be fulfilled in their season 121 and the people waited for zacharias and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple 122 and when he came out he could not speak unto them and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple for he beckoned unto them and remained speechless 123 and it came to pass that as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished he departed to his own house 124 and after those days his wife elisabeth conceived and hid herself five months saying 125 thus hath the lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me to take away my reproach among men 126 and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth 127 to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgins name was mary 128 and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that art highly favoured the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women 129 and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be 130 and the angel said unto her fear not mary for thou hast found favour with god 131 and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name jesus 132 he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david 133 and he shall reign over the house of jacob for ever and of his kingdom there shall be no end 134 then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing i know not a man 135 and the angel answered and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god 136 and behold thy cousin elisabeth she hath also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren 137 for with god nothing shall be impossible 138 and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her 139 and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of juda 140 and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elisabeth 141 and it came to pass that when elisabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elisabeth was filled with the holy ghost 142 and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb 143 and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me 144 for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy 145 and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord 146 and mary said my soul doth magnify the lord 147 and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my saviour 148 for he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed 149 for he that is mighty hath done to me great things and holy is his name 150 and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation 151 he hath shewed strength with his arm he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts 152 he hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree 153 he hath filled the hungry with good things and the rich he hath sent empty away 154 he hath holpen his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy 155 as he spake to our fathers to abraham and to his seed for ever 156 and mary abode with her about three months and returned to her own house 157 now elisabeths full time came that she should be delivered and she brought forth a son 158 and her neighbours and her cousins heard how the lord had shewed great mercy upon her and they rejoiced with her 159 and it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they called him zacharias after the name of his father 160 and his mother answered and said not so but he shall be called john 161 and they said unto her there is none of thy kindred that is called by this name 162 and they made signs to his father how he would have him called 163 and he asked for a writing table and wrote saying his name is john and they marvelled all 164 and his mouth was opened immediately and his tongue loosed and he spake and praised god 165 and fear came on all that dwelt round about them and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of judaea 166 and all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts saying what manner of child shall this be and the hand of the lord was with him 167 and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost and prophesied saying 168 blessed be the lord god of israel for he hath visited and redeemed his people 169 and hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david 170 as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world began 171 that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us 172 to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant 173 the oath which he sware to our father abraham 174 that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear 175 in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life 176 and thou child shalt be called the prophet of the highest for thou shalt go before the face of the lord to prepare his ways 177 to give knowledge of salvation unto his people by the remission of their sins 178 through the tender mercy of our god whereby the dayspring from on high hath visited us 179 to give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the way of peace 180 and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit and was in the deserts till the day of his shewing unto israel 21 and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from caesar augustus that all the world should be taxed 22 and this taxing was first made when cyrenius was governor of syria 23 and all went to be taxed every one into his own city 24 and joseph also went up from galilee out of the city of nazareth into judaea unto the city of david which is called bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of david 25 to be taxed with mary his espoused wife being great with child 26 and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered 27 and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn 28 and there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night 29 and lo the angel of the lord came upon them and the glory of the lord shone round about them and they were sore afraid 210 and the angel said unto them fear not for behold i bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people 211 for unto you is born this day in the city of david a saviour which is christ the lord 212 and this shall be a sign unto you ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger 213 and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising god and saying 214 glory to god in the highest and on earth peace good will toward men 215 and it came to pass as the angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherds said one to another let us now go even unto bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the lord hath made known unto us 216 and they came with haste and found mary and joseph and the babe lying in a manger 217 and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child 218 and all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds 219 but mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart 220 and the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things that they had heard and seen as it was told unto them 221 and when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child his name was called jesus which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb 222 and when the days of her purification according to the law of moses were accomplished they brought him to jerusalem to present him to the lord 223 as it is written in the law of the lord every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the lord 224 and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the lord a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons 225 and behold there was a man in jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him 226 and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lords christ 227 and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law 228 then took he him up in his arms and blessed god and said 229 lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word 230 for mine eyes have seen thy salvation 231 which thou hast prepared before the face of all people 232 a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel 233 and joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him 234 and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against 235 yea a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed 236 and there was one anna a prophetess the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of aser she was of a great age and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity 237 and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day 238 and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the lord and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in jerusalem 239 and when they had performed all things according to the law of the lord they returned into galilee to their own city nazareth 240 and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him 241 now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover 242 and when he was twelve years old they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast 243 and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus tarried behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of it 244 but they supposing him to have been in the company went a days journey and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance 245 and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem seeking him 246 and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions 247 and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers 248 and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing 249 and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me wist ye not that i must be about my fathers business 250 and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them 251 and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart 252 and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favour with god and man 31 now in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar pontius pilate being governor of judaea and herod being tetrarch of galilee and his brother philip tetrarch of ituraea and of the region of trachonitis and lysanias the tetrarch of abilene 32 annas and caiaphas being the high priests the word of god came unto john the son of zacharias in the wilderness 33 and he came into all the country about jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins 34 as it is written in the book of the words of esaias the prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make his paths straight 35 every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough ways shall be made smooth 36 and all flesh shall see the salvation of god 37 then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him o generation of vipers who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come 38 bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves we have abraham to our father for i say unto you that god is able of these stones to raise up children unto abraham 39 and now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees every tree therefore which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire 310 and the people asked him saying what shall we do then 311 he answereth and saith unto them he that hath two coats let him impart to him that hath none and he that hath meat let him do likewise 312 then came also publicans to be baptized and said unto him master what shall we do 313 and he said unto them exact no more than that which is appointed you 314 and the soldiers likewise demanded of him saying and what shall we do and he said unto them do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely and be content with your wages 315 and as the people were in expectation and all men mused in their hearts of john whether he were the christ or not 316 john answered saying unto them all i indeed baptize you with water but one mightier than i cometh the latchet of whose shoes i am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire 317 whose fan is in his hand and he will throughly purge his floor and will gather the wheat into his garner but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable 318 and many other things in his exhortation preached he unto the people 319 but herod the tetrarch being reproved by him for herodias his brother philips wife and for all the evils which herod had done 320 added yet this above all that he shut up john in prison 321 now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that jesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was opened 322 and the holy ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice came from heaven which said thou art my beloved son in thee i am well pleased 323 and jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age being as was supposed the son of joseph which was the son of heli 324 which was the son of matthat which was the son of levi which was the son of melchi which was the son of janna which was the son of joseph 325 which was the son of mattathias which was the son of amos which was the son of naum which was the son of esli which was the son of nagge 326 which was the son of maath which was the son of mattathias which was the son of semei which was the son of joseph which was the son of juda 327 which was the son of joanna which was the son of rhesa which was the son of zorobabel which was the son of salathiel which was the son of neri 328 which was the son of melchi which was the son of addi which was the son of cosam which was the son of elmodam which was the son of er 329 which was the son

joseph which was the son of jonan which was the son of eliakim 331 which was the son of melea which was the son of menan which was the son of mattatha which was the son of nathan which was the son of david 332 which was the son of jesse which was the son of obed which was the son of booz which was the son of salmon which was the son of naasson 333 which was the son of aminadab which was the son of aram which was the son of esrom which was the son of phares which was the son of juda 334 which was the son of jacob which was the son of isaac which was the son of abraham which was the son of thara which was the son of nachor 335 which was the son of saruch which was the son of ragau which was the son of phalec which was the son of heber which was the son of sala 336 which was the son of cainan

which was the son of maleleel which was the son of cainan 338 which was the son of enos which was the son of seth which was the son of adam which was the son of god 41 and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness 42 being forty days tempted of the devil and in those days he did eat nothing and when they were ended he afterward hungered 43 and the devil said unto him if thou be the son of god command this stone that it be made bread 44 and jesus answered him saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of god 45 and the devil taking him up into an high mountain shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time 46 and the devil said unto him all this power will i give thee and the glory of them for that is delivered unto me and to whomsoever i will i give it 47 if thou therefore wilt worship me all shall be thine 48 and jesus answered and said unto him get thee behind me satan for it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve 49 and he brought him to jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him if thou be the son of god cast thyself down from hence 410 for it is written he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee 411 and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone 412 and jesus answering said unto him it is said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god 413 and when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season 414 and jesus returned in the power of the spirit into galilee and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about 415 and he taught in their synagogues being glorified of all 416 and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read 417 and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet esaias and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written 418 the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised 419 to preach the acceptable year of the lord 420 and he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him 421 and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears 422 and all bare him witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth and they said is not this josephs son 423 and he said unto them ye will surely say unto me this proverb physician heal thyself whatsoever we have heard done in capernaum do also here in thy country 424 and he said verily i say unto you no prophet is accepted in his own country 425 but i tell you of a truth many widows were in israel in the days of elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land 426 but unto none of them was elias sent save unto sarepta a city of sidon unto a woman that was a widow 427 and many lepers were in israel in the time of eliseus the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving naaman the syrian 428 and all they in the synagogue when they heard these things were filled with wrath 429 and rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built that they might cast him down headlong 430 but he passing through the midst of them went his way 431 and came down to capernaum a city of galilee and taught them on the sabbath days 432 and they were astonished at his doctrine for his word was with power 433 and in the synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an unclean devil and cried out with a loud voice 434 saying let us alone what have we to do with thee thou jesus of nazareth art thou come to destroy us i know thee who thou art the holy one of god 435 and jesus rebuked him saying hold thy peace and come out of him and when the devil had thrown him in the midst he came out of him and hurt him not 436 and they were all amazed and spake among themselves saying what a word is this for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits and they come out 437 and the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about 438 and he arose out of the synagogue and entered into simons house and simons wifes mother was taken with a great fever and they besought him for her 439 and he stood over her and rebuked the fever and it left her and immediately she arose and ministered unto them 440 now when the sun was setting all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on every one of them and healed them 441 and devils also came out of many crying out and saying thou art christ the son of god and he rebuking them suffered them not to speak for they knew that he was christ 442 and when it was day he departed and went into a desert place and the people sought him and came unto him and stayed him that he should not depart from them 443 and he said unto them i must preach the kingdom of god to other cities also for therefore am i sent 444 and he preached in the synagogues of galilee 51 and it came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of god he stood by the lake of gennesaret 52 and saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets 53 and he entered into one of the ships which was simons and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship 54 now when he had left speaking he said unto simon launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a draught 55 and simon answering said unto him master we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing nevertheless at thy word i will let down the net 56 and when they had this done they inclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net brake 57 and they beckoned unto their partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they began to sink 58 when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesus knees saying depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord 59 for he was astonished and all that were with him at the draught of the fishes which they had taken 510 and so was also james and john the sons of zebedee which were partners with simon and jesus said unto simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men 511 and when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed him 512 and it came to pass when he was in a certain city behold a man full of leprosy who seeing jesus fell on his face and besought him saying lord if thou wilt thou canst make me clean 513 and he put forth his hand and touched him saying i will be thou clean and immediately the leprosy departed from him 514 and he charged him to tell no man but go and shew thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing according as moses commanded for a testimony unto them 515 but so much the more went there a fame abroad of him and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities 516 and he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed 517 and it came to pass on a certain day as he was teaching that there were pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by which were come out of every town of galilee and judaea and jerusalem and the power of the lord was present to heal them 518 and behold men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him 519 and when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude they went upon the housetop and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before jesus 520 and when he saw their faith he said unto him man thy sins are forgiven thee 521 and the scribes and the pharisees began to reason saying who is this which speaketh blasphemies who can forgive sins but god alone 522 but when jesus perceived their thoughts he answering said unto them what reason ye in your hearts 523 whether is easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk 524 but that ye may know that the son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins he said unto the sick of the palsy i say unto thee arise and take up thy couch and go into thine house 525 and immediately he rose up before them and took up that whereon he lay and departed to his own house glorifying god 526 and they were all amazed and they glorified god and were filled with fear saying we have seen strange things to day 527 and after these things he went forth and saw a publican named levi sitting at the receipt of custom and he said unto him follow me 528 and he left all rose up and followed him 529 and levi made him a great feast in his own house and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them 530 but their scribes and pharisees murmured against his disciples saying why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners 531 and jesus answering said unto them they that are whole need not a physician but they that are sick 532 i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance 533 and they said unto him why do the disciples of john fast often and make prayers and likewise the disciples of the pharisees but thine eat and drink 534 and he said unto them can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them 535 but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days 536 and he spake also a parable unto them no man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new maketh a rent and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old 537 and no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles shall perish 538 but new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preserved 539 no man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new for he saith the old is better 61 and it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first that he went through the corn fields and his disciples plucked the ears of corn and did eat rubbing them in their hands 62 and certain of the pharisees said unto them why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days 63 and jesus answering them said have ye not read so much as this what david did when himself was an hungred and they which were with him 64 how he went into the house of god and did take and eat the shewbread and gave also to them that were with him which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone 65 and he said unto them that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath 66 and it came to pass also on another sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught and there was a man whose right hand was withered 67 and the scribes and pharisees watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath day that they might find an accusation against him 68 but he knew their thoughts and said to the man which had the withered hand rise up and stand forth in the midst and he arose and stood forth 69 then said jesus unto them i will ask you one thing is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy it 610 and looking round about upon them all he said unto the man stretch forth thy hand and he did so and his hand was restored whole as the other 611 and they were filled with madness and communed one with another what they might do to jesus 612 and it came to pass in those days that he went out into a mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to god 613 and when it was day he called unto him his disciples and of them he chose twelve whom also he named apostles 614 simon whom he also named peter and andrew his brother james and john philip and bartholomew 615 matthew and thomas james the son of alphaeus and simon called zelotes 616 and judas the brother of james and judas iscariot which also was the traitor 617 and he came down with them and stood in the plain and the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all judaea and jerusalem and from the sea coast of tyre and sidon which came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases 618 and they that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed 619 and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and healed them all 620 and he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said blessed be ye poor for yours is the kingdom of god 621 blessed are ye that hunger now for ye shall be filled blessed are ye that weep now for ye shall laugh 622 blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of mans sake 623 rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy for behold your reward is great in heaven for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets 624 but woe unto you that are rich for ye have received your consolation 625 woe unto you that are full for ye shall hunger woe unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep 626 woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets 627 but i say unto you which hear love your enemies do good to them which hate you 628 bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you 629 and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take thy coat also 630 give to every man that asketh of thee and of him that taketh away thy goods ask them not again 631 and as ye would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise 632 for if ye love them which love you what thank have ye for sinners also love those that love them 633 and if ye do good to them which do good to you what thank have ye for sinners also do even the same 634 and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what thank have ye for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again 635 but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing again and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil 636 be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful 637 judge not and ye shall not be judged condemn not and ye shall not be condemned forgive and ye shall be forgiven 638 give and it shall be given unto you good measure pressed down and shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again 639 and he spake a parable unto them can the blind lead the blind shall they not both fall into the ditch 640 the disciple is not above his master but every one that is perfect shall be as his master 641 and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brothers eye but perceivest not the beam that is in thine own eye 642 either how canst thou say to thy brother brother let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye when thou thyself beholdest not the beam that is in thine own eye thou hypocrite cast out first the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brothers eye 643 for a good tree bringeth not forth corrupt fruit neither doth a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit 644 for every tree is known by his own fruit for of thorns men do not gather figs nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes 645 a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh 646 and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say 647 whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sayings and doeth them i will shew you to whom he is like 648 he is like a man which built an house and digged deep and laid the foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the stream beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock 649 but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that without a foundation built an house upon the earth against which the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great 71 now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people he entered into capernaum 72 and a certain centurions servant who was dear unto him was sick and ready to die 73 and when he heard of jesus he sent unto him the elders of the jews beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant 74 and when they came to jesus they besought him instantly saying that he was worthy for whom he should do this 75 for he loveth our nation and he hath built us a synagogue 76 then jesus went with them and when he was now not far from the house the centurion sent friends to him saying unto him lord trouble not thyself for i am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof 77 wherefore neither thought i myself worthy to come unto thee but say in a word and my servant shall be healed 78 for i also am a man set under authority having under me soldiers and i say unto one go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it 79 when jesus heard these things he marvelled at him and turned him about and said unto the people that followed him i say unto you i have not found so great faith no not in israel 710 and they that were sent returning to the house found the servant whole that had been sick 711 and it came to pass the day after that he went into a city called nain and many of his disciples went with him and much people 712 now when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her 713 and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not 714 and he came and touched the bier and they that bare him stood still and he said young man i say unto thee arise 715 and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother 716 and there came a fear on all and they glorified god saying that a great prophet is risen up among us and that god hath visited his people 717 and this rumour of him went forth throughout all judaea and throughout all the region round about 718 and the disciples of john shewed him of all these things 719 and john calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to jesus saying art thou he that should come or look we for another 720 when the men were come unto him they said john baptist hath sent us unto thee saying art thou he that should come or look we for another 721 and in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits and unto many that were blind he gave sight 722 then jesus answering said unto them go your way and tell john what things ye have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised to the poor the gospel is preached 723 and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me 724 and when the messengers of john were departed he began to speak unto the people concerning john what went ye out into the wilderness for to see a reed shaken with the wind 725 but what went ye out for to see a man clothed in soft raiment behold they which are gorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings courts 726 but what went ye out for to see a prophet yea i say unto you and much more than a prophet 727 this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee 728 for i say unto you among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than john the baptist but he that is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he 729 and all the people that heard him and the publicans justified god being baptized with the baptism of john 730 but the pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of god against themselves being not baptized of him 731 and the lord said whereunto then shall i liken the men of this generation and to what are they like 732 they are like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying we have piped unto you and ye have not danced we have mourned to you and ye have not wept 733 for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and ye say he hath a devil 734 the son of man is come eating and drinking and ye say behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber a friend of publicans and sinners 735 but wisdom is justified of all her children 736 and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to meat 737 and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus sat at meat in the pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment 738 and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment 739 now when the pharisee which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him for she is a sinner 740 and jesus answering said unto him simon i have somewhat to say unto thee and he saith master say on 741 there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed five hundred pence and the other fifty 742 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most 743 simon answered and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou hast rightly judged 744 and he turned to the woman and said unto simon seest thou this woman i entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head 745 thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet 746 my head with oil thou didst not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment 747 wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little 748 and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven 749 and they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgiveth sins also 750 and he said to the woman thy faith hath saved thee go in peace 81 and it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and village preaching and shewing the glad tidings of the kingdom of god and the twelve were with him 82 and certain women which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities mary called magdalene out of whom went seven devils 83 and joanna the wife of chuza herods steward and susanna and many others which ministered unto him of their substance 84 and when much people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city he spake by a parable 85 a sower went out to sow his seed and as he sowed some fell by the way side and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air devoured it 86 and some fell upon a rock and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lacked moisture 87 and some fell among thorns and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it 88 and other fell on good ground and sprang up and bare fruit an hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried he that hath ears to hear let him hear 89 and his disciples asked him saying what might this parable be 810 and he said unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of god but to others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand 811 now the parable is this the seed is the word of god 812 those by the way side are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should believe and be saved 813 they on the rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away 814 and that which fell among thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection 815 but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience 816 no man when he hath lighted a candle covereth it with a vessel or putteth it under a bed but setteth it on a candlestick that they which enter in may see the light 817 for nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest neither any thing hid that shall not be known and come abroad 818 take heed therefore how ye hear for whosoever hath to him shall be given and whosoever hath not from him shall be taken even that which he seemeth to have 819 then came to him his mother and his brethren and could not come at him for the press 820 and it was told him by certain which said thy mother and thy brethren stand without desiring to see thee 821 and he answered and said unto them my mother and my brethren are these which hear the word of god and do it 822 now it came to pass on a certain day that he went into a ship with his disciples and he said unto them let us go over unto the other side of the lake and they launched forth 823 but as they sailed he fell asleep and there came down a storm of wind on the lake and they were filled with water and were in jeopardy 824 and they came to him and awoke him saying master master we perish then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and they ceased and there was a calm 825 and he said unto them where is your faith and they being afraid wondered saying one to another what manner of man is this for he commandeth even the winds and water and they obey him 826 and they arrived at the country of the gadarenes which is over against galilee 827 and when he went forth to land there met him out of the city a certain man which had devils long time and ware no clothes neither abode in any house but in the tombs 828 when he saw jesus he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of god most high i beseech thee torment me not 829 for he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man for oftentimes it had caught him and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters and he brake the bands and was driven of the devil into the wilderness 830 and jesus asked him saying what is thy name and he said legion because many devils were entered into him 831 and they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the deep 832 and there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain and they besought him that he would suffer them to enter into them and he suffered them 833 then went the devils out of the man and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked 834 when they that fed them saw what was done they fled and went and told it in the city and in the country 835 then they went out to see what was done and came to jesus and found the man out of whom the devils were departed sitting at the feet of jesus clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid 836 they also which saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the devils was healed 837 then the whole multitude of the country of the gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them for they were taken with great fear and he went up into the ship and returned back again 838 now the man out of whom the devils were departed besought him that he might be with him but jesus sent him away saying 839 return to thine own house and shew how great things god hath done unto thee and he went his way and published throughout the whole city how great things jesus had done unto him 840 and it came to pass that when jesus was returned the people gladly received him for they were all waiting for him 841 and behold there came a man named jairus and he was a ruler of the synagogue and he fell down at jesus feet and besought him that he would come into his house 842 for he had one only daughter about twelve years of age and she lay a dying but as he went the people thronged him 843 and a woman having an issue of blood twelve years which had spent all her living upon physicians neither could be healed of any 844 came behind him and touched the border of his garment and immediately her issue of blood stanched 845 and jesus said who touched me when all denied peter and they that were with him said master the multitude throng thee and press thee and sayest thou who touched me 846 and jesus said somebody hath touched me for i perceive that virtue is gone out of me 847 and when the woman saw that she was not hid she came trembling and falling down before him she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately 848 and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace 849 while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogues house saying to him thy daughter is dead trouble not the master 850 but when jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not believe only and she shall be made whole 851 and when he came into the house he suffered no man to go in save peter and james and john and the father and the mother of the maiden 852 and all wept and bewailed her but he said weep not she is not dead but sleepeth 853 and they laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead 854 and he put them all out and took her by the hand and called saying maid arise 855 and her spirit came again and she arose straightway and he commanded to give her meat 856 and her parents were astonished but he charged them that they should tell no man what was done 91 then he called his twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases 92 and he sent them to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick 93 and he said unto them take nothing for your journey neither staves nor scrip neither bread neither money neither have two coats apiece 94 and whatsoever house ye enter into there abide and thence depart 95 and whosoever will not receive you when ye go out of that city shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them 96 and they departed and went through the towns preaching the gospel and healing every where 97 now herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him and he was perplexed because that it was said of some that john was risen from the dead 98 and of some that elias had appeared and of others that one of the old prophets was risen again 99 and herod said john have i beheaded but who is this of whom i hear such things and he desired to see him 910 and the apostles when they were returned told him all that they had done and he took them and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called bethsaida 911 and the people when they knew it followed him and he received them and spake unto them of the kingdom of god and healed them that had need of healing 912 and when the day began to wear away then came the twelve and said unto him send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and country round about and lodge and get victuals for we are here in a desert place 913 but he said unto them give ye them to eat and they said we have no more but five loaves and two fishes except we should go and buy meat for all this people 914 for they were about five thousand men and he said to his disciples make them sit down by fifties in a company 915 and they did so and made them all sit down 916 then he took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed them and brake and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude 917 and they did eat and were all filled and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets 918 and it came to pass as he was alone praying his disciples were with him and he asked them saying whom say the people that i am 919 they answering said john the baptist but some say elias and others say that one of the old prophets is risen again 920 he said unto them but whom say ye that i am peter answering said the christ of god 921 and he straitly charged them and commanded them to tell no man that thing 922 saying the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be slain and be raised the third day 923 and he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me 924 for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it 925 for what is a man advantaged if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be cast away 926 for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his fathers and of the holy angels 927 but i tell you of a truth there be some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god 928 and it came to pass about an eight days after these sayings he took peter and john and james and went up into a mountain to pray 929 and as he prayed the fashion of his countenance was altered and his raiment was white and glistering 930 and behold there talked with him two men which were moses and elias 931 who appeared in glory and spake of his decease which he should accomplish at jerusalem 932 but peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep and when they were awake they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him 933 and it came to pass as they departed from him peter said unto jesus master it is good for us to be here and let us make three tabernacles one for thee and one for moses and one for elias not knowing what he said 934 while he thus spake there came a cloud and overshadowed them and they feared as they entered into the cloud 935 and there came a voice out of the cloud saying this is my beloved son hear him 936 and when the voice was past jesus was found alone and they kept it close and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen 937 and it came to pass that on the next day when they were come down from the hill much people met him 938 and behold a man of the company cried out saying master i beseech thee look upon my son for he is mine only child 939 and lo a spirit taketh him and he suddenly crieth out and it teareth him that he foameth again and bruising him hardly departeth from him 940 and i besought thy disciples to cast him out and they could not 941 and jesus answering said o faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you and suffer you bring thy son hither 942 and as he was yet a coming the devil threw him down and tare him and jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and delivered him again to his father 943 and they were all amazed at the mighty power of god but while they wondered every one at all things which jesus did he said unto his disciples 944 let these sayings sink down into your ears for the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men 945 but they understood not this saying and it was hid from them that they perceived it not and they feared to ask him of that saying 946 then there arose a reasoning among them which of them should be greatest 947 and jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him 948 and said unto them whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great 949 and john answered and said master we saw one casting out devils in thy name and we forbad him because he followeth not with us 950 and jesus said unto him forbid him not for he that is not against us is for us 951 and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he stedfastly set his face to go to jerusalem 952 and sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the samaritans to make ready for him 953 and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to jerusalem 954 and when his disciples james and john saw this they said lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as elias did 955 but he turned and rebuked them and said ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of 956 for the son of man is not come to destroy mens lives but to save them and they went to another village 957 and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him lord i will follow thee whithersoever thou goest 958 and jesus said unto him foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man hath not where to lay his head 959 and he said unto another follow me but he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father 960 jesus said unto him let the dead bury their dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of god 961 and another also said lord i will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house 962 and jesus said unto him no man having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of god 101 after these things the lord appointed other seventy also and sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whither he himself would come 102 therefore said he unto them the harvest truly is great but the labourers are few pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he would send forth labourers into his harvest 103 go your ways behold i send you forth as lambs among wolves 104 carry neither purse nor scrip nor shoes and salute no man by the way 105 and into whatsoever house ye enter first say peace be to this house 106 and if the son of peace be there your peace shall rest upon it if not it shall turn to you again 107 and in the same house remain eating and drinking such things as they give for the labourer is worthy of his hire go not from house to house 108 and into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you eat such things as are set before you 109 and heal the sick that are therein and say unto them the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you 1010 but into whatsoever city ye enter and they receive you not go your ways out into the streets of the same and say 1011 even the very dust of your city which cleaveth on us we do wipe off against you notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of god is come nigh unto you 1012 but i say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in that day for sodom than for that city 1013 woe unto thee chorazin woe unto thee bethsaida for if the mighty works had been done in tyre and sidon which have been done in you they had a great while ago repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes 1014 but it shall be more tolerable for tyre and sidon at the judgment than for you 1015 and thou capernaum which art exalted to heaven shalt be thrust down to hell 1016 he that heareth you heareth me and he that despiseth you despiseth me and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me 1017 and the seventy returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name 1018 and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven 1019 behold i give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you 1020 notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven 1021 in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit and said i thank thee o father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight 1022 all things are delivered to me of my father and no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him 1023 and he turned him unto his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see 1024 for i tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them 1025 and behold a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life 1026 he said unto him what is written in the law how readest thou 1027 and he answering said thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy mind and thy neighbour as thyself 1028 and he said unto him thou hast answered right this do and thou shalt live 1029 but he willing to justify himself said unto jesus and who is my neighbour 1030 and jesus answering said a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead 1031 and by chance there came down a certain priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side 1032 and likewise a levite when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side 1033 but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him 1034 and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him 1035 and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever thou spendest more when i come again i will repay thee 1036 which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves 1037 and he said he that shewed mercy on him then said jesus unto him go and do thou likewise 1038 now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain village and a certain woman named martha received him into her house 1039 and she had a sister called mary which also sat at jesus feet and heard his word 1040 but martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said lord dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone bid her therefore that she help me 1041 and jesus answered and said unto her martha martha thou art careful and troubled about many things 1042 but one thing is needful and mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her 111 and it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him lord teach us to pray as john also taught his disciples 112 and he said unto them when ye pray say our father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in earth 113 give us day by day our daily bread 114 and forgive us our sins for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil 115 and he said unto them which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him friend lend me three loaves 116 for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me and i have nothing to set before him 117 and he from within shall answer and say trouble me not the door is now shut and my children are with me in bed i cannot rise and give thee 118 i say unto you though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth 119 and i say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you 1110 for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened 1111 if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent 1112 or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion 1113 if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him 1114 and he was casting out a devil and it was dumb and it came to pass when the devil was gone out the dumb spake and the people wondered 1115 but some of them said he casteth out devils through beelzebub the chief of the devils 1116 and others tempting him sought of him a sign from heaven 1117 but he knowing their thoughts said unto them every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and a house divided against a house falleth 1118 if satan also be divided against himself how shall his kingdom stand because ye say that i cast out devils through beelzebub 1119 and if i by beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your sons cast them out therefore shall they be your judges 1120 but if i with the finger of god cast out devils no doubt the kingdom of god is come upon you 1121 when a strong man armed keepeth his palace his goods are in peace 1122 but when a stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted and divideth his spoils 1123 he that is not with me is against me and he that gathereth not with me scattereth 1124 when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest and finding none he saith i will return unto my house whence i came out 1125 and when he cometh he findeth it swept and garnished 1126 then goeth he and taketh to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself and they enter in and dwell there and the last state of that man is worse than the first 1127 and it came to pass as he spake these things a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice and said unto him blessed is the womb that bare thee and the paps which thou hast sucked 1128 but he said yea rather blessed are they that hear the word of god and keep it 1129 and when the people were gathered thick together he began to say this is an evil generation they seek a sign and there shall no sign be given it but the sign of jonas the prophet 1130 for as jonas was a sign unto the ninevites so shall also the son of man be to this generation 1131 the queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon and behold a greater than solomon is here 1132 the men of nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it for they repented at the preaching of jonas and behold a greater than jonas is here 1133 no man when he hath lighted a candle putteth it in a secret place neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that they which come in may see the light 1134 the light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is single thy whole body also is full of light but when thine eye is evil thy body also is full of darkness 1135 take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness 1136 if thy whole body therefore be full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light 1137 and as he spake a certain pharisee besought him to dine with him and he went in and sat down to meat 1138 and when the pharisee saw it he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner 1139 and the lord said unto him now do ye pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness 1140 ye fools did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also 1141 but rather give alms of such things as ye have and behold all things are clean unto you 1142 but woe unto you pharisees for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs and pass over judgment and the love of god these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone 1143 woe unto you pharisees for ye love the uppermost seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets 1144 woe unto you scribes and pharisees hypocrites for ye are as graves which appear not and the men that walk over them are not aware of them 1145 then answered one of the lawyers and said unto him master thus saying thou reproachest us also 1146 and he said woe unto you also ye lawyers for ye lade men with burdens grievous to be borne and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers 1147 woe unto you for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and your fathers killed them 1148 truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers for they indeed killed them and ye build their sepulchres 1149 therefore also said the wisdom of god i will send them prophets and apostles and some of them they shall slay and persecute 1150 that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation 1151 from the blood of abel unto the blood of zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple verily i say unto you it shall be required of this generation 1152 woe unto you lawyers for ye have taken away the key of knowledge ye entered not in yourselves and them that were entering in ye hindered 1153 and as he said these things unto them the scribes and the pharisees began to urge him vehemently and to provoke him to speak of many things 1154 laying wait for him and seeking to catch something out of his mouth that they might accuse him 121 in the mean time when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people insomuch that they trode one upon another he began to say unto his disciples first of all beware ye of the leaven of the pharisees which is hypocrisy 122 for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed neither hid that shall not be known 123 therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops 124 and i say unto you my friends be not afraid of them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do 125 but i will forewarn you whom ye shall fear fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell yea i say unto you fear him 126 are not five sparrows sold for two farthings and not one of them is forgotten before god 127 but even the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows 128 also i say unto you whosoever shall confess me before men him shall the son of man also confess before the angels of god 129 but he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the angels of god 1210 and whosoever shall speak a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but unto him that blasphemeth against the holy ghost it shall not be forgiven 1211 and when they bring you unto the synagogues and unto magistrates and powers take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer or what ye shall say 1212 for the holy ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say 1213 and one of the company said unto him master speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me 1214 and he said unto him man who made me a judge or a divider over you 1215 and he said unto them take heed and beware of covetousness for a mans life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth 1216 and he spake a parable unto them saying the ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully 1217 and he thought within himself saying what shall i do because i have no room where to bestow my fruits 1218 and he said this will i do i will pull down my barns and build greater and there will i bestow all my fruits and my goods 1219 and i will say to my soul soul thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thine ease eat drink and be merry 1220 but god said unto him thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee then whose shall those things be which thou hast provided 1221 so is he that layeth up treasure for himself and is not rich toward god 1222 and he said unto his disciples therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what ye shall eat neither for the body what ye shall put on 1223 the life is more than meat and the body is more than raiment 1224 consider the ravens for they neither sow nor reap which neither have storehouse nor barn and god feedeth them how much more are ye better than the fowls 1225 and which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit 1226 if ye then be not able to do that thing which is least why take ye thought for the rest 1227 consider the lilies how they grow they toil not they spin not and yet i say unto you that solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these 1228 if then god so clothe the grass which is to day in the field and to morrow is cast into the oven how much more will he clothe you o ye of little faith 1229 and seek not ye what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink neither be ye of doubtful mind 1230 for all these things do the nations of the world seek after and your father knoweth that ye have need of these things 1231 but rather seek ye the kingdom of god and all these things shall be added unto you 1232 fear not little flock for it is your fathers good pleasure to give you the kingdom 1233 sell that ye have and give alms provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where no thief approacheth neither moth corrupteth 1234 for where your treasure is there will your heart be also 1235 let your loins be girded about and your lights burning 1236 and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord when he will return from the wedding that when he cometh and knocketh they may open unto him immediately 1237 blessed are those servants whom the lord when he cometh shall find watching verily i say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to meat and will come forth and serve them 1238 and if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so blessed are those servants 1239 and this know that if the goodman of the house had known what hour the thief would come he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken through 1240 be ye therefore ready also for the son of man cometh at an hour when ye think not 1241 then peter said unto him lord speakest thou this parable unto us or even to all 1242 and the lord said who then is that faithful and wise steward whom his lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of meat in due season 1243 blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing 1244 of a truth i say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he hath 1245 but and if that servant say in his heart my lord delayeth his coming and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens and to eat and drink and to be drunken 1246 the lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not for him and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him in sunder and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers 1247 and that servant which knew his lords will and prepared not himself neither did according to his will shall be beaten with many stripes 1248 but he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes for unto whomsoever much is given of him shall be much required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more 1249 i am come to send fire on the earth and what will i if it be already kindled 1250 but i have a baptism to be baptized with and how am i straitened till it be accomplished 1251 suppose ye that i am come to give peace on earth i tell you nay but rather division 1252 for from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided three against two and two against three 1253 the father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother the mother in law against her daughter in law and the daughter in law against her mother in law 1254 and he said also to the people when ye see a cloud rise out of the west straightway ye say there cometh a shower and so it is 1255 and when ye see the south wind blow ye say there will be heat and it cometh to pass 1256 ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth but how is it that ye do not discern this time 1257 yea and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right 1258 when thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate as thou art in the way give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him lest he hale thee to the judge and the judge deliver thee to the officer and the officer cast thee into prison 1259 i tell thee thou shalt not depart thence till thou hast paid the very last mite 131 there were present at that season some that told him of the galilaeans whose blood pilate had mingled with their sacrifices 132 and jesus answering said unto them suppose ye that these galilaeans were sinners above all the galilaeans because they suffered such things 133 i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish 134 or those eighteen upon whom the tower in siloam fell and slew them think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in jerusalem 135 i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish 136 he spake also this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none 137 then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground 138 and he answering said unto him lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it and dung it 139 and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it down 1310 and he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath 1311 and behold there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift up herself 1312 and when jesus saw her he called her to him and said unto her woman thou art loosed from thine infirmity 1313 and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god 1314 and the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation because that jesus had healed on the sabbath day and said unto the people there are six days in which men ought to work in them therefore come and be healed and not on the sabbath day 1315 the lord then answered him and said thou hypocrite doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead him away to watering 1316 and ought not this woman being a daughter of abraham whom satan hath bound lo these eighteen years be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day 1317 and when he had said these things all his adversaries were ashamed and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him 1318 then said he unto what is the kingdom of god like and whereunto shall i resemble it 1319 it is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew and waxed a great tree and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it 1320 and again he said whereunto shall i liken the kingdom of god 1321 it is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened 1322 and he went through the cities and villages teaching and journeying toward jerusalem 1323 then said one unto him lord are there few that be saved and he said unto them 1324 strive to enter in at the strait gate for many i say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able 1325 when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut to the door and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door saying lord lord open unto us and he shall answer and say unto you i know you not whence ye are 1326 then shall ye begin to say we have eaten and drunk in thy presence and thou hast taught in our streets 1327 but he shall say i tell you i know you not whence ye are depart from me all ye workers of iniquity 1328 there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see abraham and isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god and you yourselves thrust out 1329 and they shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit down in the kingdom of god 1330 and behold there are last which shall be first and there are first which shall be last 1331 the same day there came certain of the pharisees saying unto him get thee out and depart hence for herod will kill thee 1332 and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox behold i cast out devils and i do cures to day and to morrow and the third day i shall be perfected 1333 nevertheless i must walk to day and to morrow and the day following for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of jerusalem 1334 o jerusalem jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings and ye would not 1335 behold your house is left unto you desolate and verily i say unto you ye shall not see me until the time come when ye shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord 141 and it came to pass as he went into the house of one of the chief pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watched him 142 and behold there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy 143 and jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and pharisees saying is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day 144 and they held their peace and he took him and healed him and let him go 145 and answered them saying which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day 146 and they could not answer him again to these things 147 and he put forth a parable to those which were bidden when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms saying unto them 148 when thou art bidden of any man to a wedding sit not down in the highest room lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him 149 and he that bade thee and him come and say to thee give this man place and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room 1410 but when thou art bidden go and sit down in the lowest room that when he that bade thee cometh he may say unto thee friend go up higher then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee 1411 for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted 1412 then said he also to him that bade him when thou makest a dinner or a supper call not thy friends nor thy brethren neither thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbours lest they also bid thee again and a recompence be made thee 1413 but when thou makest a feast call the poor the maimed the lame the blind 1414 and thou shalt be blessed for they cannot recompense thee for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just 1415 and when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things he said unto him blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of god 1416 then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and bade many 1417 and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready 1418 and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him i have bought a piece of ground and i must needs go and see it i pray thee have me excused 1419 and another said i have bought five yoke of oxen and i go to prove them i pray thee have me excused 1420 and another said i have married a wife and therefore i cannot come 1421 so that servant came and shewed his lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in hither the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind 1422 and the servant said lord it is done as thou hast commanded and yet there is room 1423 and the lord said unto the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled 1424 for i say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper 1425 and there went great multitudes with him and he turned and said unto them 1426 if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own life also he cannot be my disciple 1427 and whosoever doth not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple 1428 for which of you intending to build a tower sitteth not down first and counteth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it 1429 lest haply after he hath laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it begin to mock him 1430 saying this man began to build and was not able to finish 1431 or what king going to make war against another king sitteth not down first and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand 1432 or else while the other is yet a great way off he sendeth an ambassage and desireth conditions of peace 1433 so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath he cannot be my disciple 1434 salt is good but if the salt have lost his savour wherewith shall it be seasoned 1435 it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dunghill but men cast it out he that hath ears to hear let him hear 151 then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him 152 and the pharisees and scribes murmured saying this man receiveth sinners and eateth with them 153 and he spake this parable unto them saying 154 what man of you having an hundred sheep if he lose one of them doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he find it 155 and when he hath found it he layeth it on his shoulders rejoicing 156 and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and neighbours saying unto them rejoice with me for i have found my sheep which was lost 157 i say unto you that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over ninety and nine just persons which need no repentance 158 either what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it 159 and when she hath found it she calleth her friends and her neighbours together saying rejoice with me for i have found the piece which i had lost 1510 likewise i say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth 1511 and he said a certain man had two sons 1512 and the younger of them said to his father father give me the portion of goods that falleth to me and he divided unto them his living 1513 and not many days after the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living 1514 and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in that land and he began to be in want 1515 and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine 1516 and he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him 1517 and when he came to himself he said how many hired servants of my fathers have bread enough and to spare and i perish with hunger 1518 i will arise and go to my father and will say unto him father i have sinned against heaven and before thee 1519 and am no more worthy to be called thy son make me as one of thy hired servants 1520 and he arose and came to his father but when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him 1521 and the son said unto him father i have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son 1522 but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet 1523 and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry 1524 for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they began to be merry 1525 now his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew nigh to the house he heard musick and dancing 1526 and he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant 1527 and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father hath killed the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound 1528 and he was angry and would not go in therefore came his father out and intreated him 1529 and he answering said to his father lo these many years do i serve thee neither transgressed i at any time thy commandment and yet thou never gavest me a kid that i might make merry with my friends 1530 but as soon as this thy son was come which hath devoured thy living with harlots thou hast killed for him the fatted calf 1531 and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that i have is thine 1532 it was meet that we should make merry and be glad for this thy brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found 161 and he said also unto his disciples there was a certain rich man which had a steward and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods 162 and he called him and said unto him how is it that i hear this of thee give an account of thy stewardship for thou mayest be no longer steward 163 then the steward said within himself what shall i do for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship i cannot dig to beg i am ashamed 164 i am resolved what to do that when i am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses 165 so he called every one of his lords debtors unto him and said unto the first how much owest thou unto my lord 166 and he said an hundred measures of oil and he said unto him take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty 167 then said he to another and how much owest thou and he said an hundred measures of wheat and he said unto him take thy bill and write fourscore 168 and the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light 169 and i say unto you make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness that when ye fail they may receive you into everlasting habitations 1610 he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much 1611 if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to your trust the true riches 1612 and if ye have not been faithful in that which is another mans who shall give you that which is your own 1613 no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon 1614 and the pharisees also who were covetous heard all these things and they derided him 1615 and he said unto them ye are they which justify yourselves before men but god knoweth your hearts for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of god 1616 the law and the prophets were until john since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man presseth into it 1617 and it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fail 1618 whosoever putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery 1619 there was a certain rich man which was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day 1620 and there was a certain beggar named lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores 1621 and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich mans table moreover the dogs came and licked his sores 1622 and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into abrahams bosom the rich man also died and was buried 1623 and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom 1624 and he cried and said father abraham have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for i am tormented in this flame 1625 but abraham said son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things and likewise lazarus evil things but now he is comforted and thou art tormented 1626 and beside all this between us and you there is a great gulf fixed so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from thence 1627 then he said i pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest send him to my fathers house 1628 for i have five brethren that he may testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment 1629 abraham saith unto him they have moses and the prophets let them hear them 1630 and he said nay father abraham but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent 1631 and he said unto him if they hear not moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead 171 then said he unto the disciples it is impossible but that offences will come but woe unto him through whom they come 172 it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones 173 take heed to yourselves if thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him and if he repent forgive him 174 and if he trespass against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turn again to thee saying i repent thou shalt forgive him 175 and the apostles said unto the lord increase our faith 176 and the lord said if ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed ye might say unto this sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you 177 but which of you having a servant plowing or feeding cattle will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field go and sit down to meat 178 and will not rather say unto him make ready wherewith i may sup and gird thyself and serve me till i have eaten and drunken and afterward thou shalt eat and drink 179 doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him i trow not 1710 so likewise ye when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable servants we have done that which was our duty to do 1711 and it came to pass as he went to jerusalem that he passed through the midst of samaria and galilee 1712 and as he entered into a certain village there met him ten men that were lepers which stood afar off 1713 and they lifted up their voices and said jesus master have mercy on us 1714 and when he saw them he said unto them go shew yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed 1715 and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god 1716 and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan 1717 and jesus answering said were there not ten cleansed but where are the nine 1718 there are not found that returned to give glory to god save this stranger 1719 and he said unto him arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole 1720 and when he was demanded of the pharisees when the kingdom of god should come he answered them and said the kingdom of god cometh not with observation 1721 neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom of god is within you 1722 and he said unto the disciples the days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and ye shall not see it 1723 and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them 1724 for as the lightning that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven shineth unto the other part under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his day 1725 but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation 1726 and as it was in the days of noe so shall it be also in the days of the son of man 1727 they did eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that noe entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all 1728 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded 1729 but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all 1730 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed 1731 in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not return back 1732 remember lots wife 1733 whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it 1734 i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left 1735 two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left 1736 two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left 1737 and they answered and said unto him where lord and he said unto them wheresoever the body is thither will the eagles be gathered together 181 and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint 182 saying there was in a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man 183 and there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of mine adversary 184 and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man 185 yet because this widow troubleth me i will avenge her lest by her continual coming she weary me 186 and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith 187 and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear long with them 188 i tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth 189 and he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others 1810 two men went up into the temple to pray the one a pharisee and the other a publican 1811 the pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god i thank thee that i am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this publican 1812 i fast twice in the week i give tithes of all that i possess 1813 and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner 1814 i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted 1815 and they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them 1816 but jesus called them unto him and said suffer little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of god 1817 verily i say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of god as a little child shall in no wise enter therein 1818 and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life 1819 and jesus said unto him why callest thou me good none is good save one that is god 1820 thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honour thy father and thy mother 1821 and he said all these have i kept from my youth up 1822 now when jesus heard these things he said unto him yet lackest thou one thing sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me 1823 and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich 1824 and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god 1825 for it is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god 1826 and they that heard it said who then can be saved 1827 and he said the things which are impossible with men are possible with god 1828 then peter said lo we have left all and followed thee 1829 and he said unto them verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of gods sake 1830 who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting 1831 then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them behold we go up to jerusalem and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the son of man shall be accomplished 1832 for he shall be delivered unto the gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully entreated and spitted on 1833 and they shall scourge him and put him to death and the third day he shall rise again 1834 and they understood none of these things and this saying was hid from them neither knew they the things which were spoken 1835 and it came to pass that as he was come nigh unto jericho a certain blind man sat by the way side begging 1836 and hearing the multitude pass by he asked what it meant 1837 and they told him that jesus of nazareth passeth by 1838 and he cried saying jesus thou son of david have mercy on me 1839 and they which went before rebuked him that he should hold his peace but he cried so much the more thou son of david have mercy on me 1840 and jesus stood and commanded him to be brought unto him and when he was come near he asked him 1841 saying what wilt thou that i shall do unto thee and he said lord that i may receive my sight 1842 and jesus said unto him receive thy sight thy faith hath saved thee 1843 and immediately he received his sight and followed him glorifying god and all the people when they saw it gave praise unto god 191 and jesus entered and passed through jericho 192 and behold there was a man named zacchaeus which was the chief among the publicans and he was rich 193 and he sought to see jesus who he was and could not for the press because he was little of stature 194 and he ran before and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him for he was to pass that way 195 and when jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zacchaeus make haste and come down for to day i must abide at thy house 196 and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully 197 and when they saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner 198 and zacchaeus stood and said unto the lord behold lord the half of my goods i give to the poor and if i have taken any thing from any man by false accusation i restore him fourfold 199 and jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house forsomuch as he also is a son of abraham 1910 for the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost 1911 and as they heard these things he added and spake a parable because he was nigh to jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear 1912 he said therefore a certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return 1913 and he called his ten servants and delivered them ten pounds and said unto them occupy till i come 1914 but his citizens hated him and sent a message after him saying we will not have this man to reign over us 1915 and it came to pass that when he was returned having received the kingdom then he commanded these servants to be called unto him to whom he had given the money that he might know how much every man had gained by trading 1916 then came the first saying lord thy pound hath gained ten pounds 1917 and he said unto him well thou good servant because thou hast been faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities 1918 and the second came saying lord thy pound hath gained five pounds 1919 and he said likewise to him be thou also over five cities 1920 and another came saying lord behold here is thy pound which i have kept laid up in a napkin 1921 for i feared thee because thou art an austere man thou takest up that thou layedst not down and reapest that thou didst not sow 1922 and he saith unto him out of thine own mouth will i judge thee thou wicked servant thou knewest that i was an austere man taking up that i laid not down and reaping that i did not sow 1923 wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank that at my coming i might have required mine own with usury 1924 and he said unto them that stood by take from him the pound and give it to him that hath ten pounds 1925 and they said unto him lord he hath ten pounds 1926 for i say unto you that unto every one which hath shall be given and from him that hath not even that he hath shall be taken away from him 1927 but those mine enemies which would not that i should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me 1928 and when he had thus spoken he went before ascending up to jerusalem 1929 and it came to pass when he was come nigh to bethphage and bethany at the mount called the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples 1930 saying go ye into the village over against you in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied whereon yet never man sat loose him and bring him hither 1931 and if any man ask you why do ye loose him thus shall ye say unto him because the lord hath need of him 1932 and they that were sent went their way and found even as he had said unto them 1933 and as they were loosing the colt the owners thereof said unto them why loose ye the colt 1934 and they said the lord hath need of him 1935 and they brought him to jesus and they cast their garments upon the colt and they set jesus thereon 1936 and as he went they spread their clothes in the way 1937 and when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olives the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen 1938 saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest 1939 and some of the pharisees from among the multitude said unto him master rebuke thy disciples 1940 and he answered and said unto them i tell you that if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out 1941 and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it 1942 saying if thou hadst known even thou at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes 1943 for the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and keep thee in on every side 1944 and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation 1945 and he went into the temple and began to cast out them that sold therein and them that bought 1946 saying unto them it is written my house is the house of prayer but ye have made it a den of thieves 1947 and he taught daily in the temple but the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him 1948 and could not find what they might do for all the people were very attentive to hear him 201 and it came to pass that on one of those days as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders 202 and spake unto him saying tell us by what authority doest thou these things or who is he that gave thee this authority 203 and he answered and said unto them i will also ask you one thing and answer me 204 the baptism of john was it from heaven or of men 205 and they reasoned with themselves saying if we shall say from heaven he will say why then believed ye him not 206 but and if we say of men all the people will stone us for they be persuaded that john was a prophet 207 and they answered that they could not tell whence it was 208 and jesus said unto them neither tell i you by what authority i do these things 209 then began he to speak to the people this parable a certain man planted a vineyard and let it forth to husbandmen and went into a far country for a long time 2010 and at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty 2011 and again he sent another servant and they beat him also and entreated him shamefully and sent him away empty 2012 and again he sent a third and they wounded him also and cast him out 2013 then said the lord of the vineyard what shall i do i will send my beloved son it may be they will reverence him when they see him 2014 but when the husbandmen saw him they reasoned among themselves saying this is the heir come let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours 2015 so they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him what therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them 2016 he shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others and when they heard it they said god forbid 2017 and he beheld them and said what is this then that is written the stone which the builders rejected the same is become the head of the corner 2018 whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken but on whomsoever it shall fall it will grind him to powder 2019 and the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him and they feared the people for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them 2020 and they watched him and sent forth spies which should feign themselves just men that they might take hold of his words that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor 2021 and they asked him saying master we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly neither acceptest thou the person of any but teachest the way of god truly 2022 is it lawful for us to give tribute unto caesar or no 2023 but he perceived their craftiness and said unto them why tempt ye me 2024 shew me a penny whose image and superscription hath it they answered and said caesars 2025 and he said unto them render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesars and unto god the things which be gods 2026 and they could not take hold of his words before the people and they marvelled at his answer and held their peace 2027 then came to him certain of the sadducees which deny that there is any resurrection and they asked him 2028 saying master moses wrote unto us if any mans brother die having a wife and he die without children that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother 2029 there were therefore seven brethren and the first took a wife and died without children 2030 and the second took her to wife and he died childless 2031 and the third took her and in like manner the seven also and they left no children and died 2032 last of all the woman died also 2033 therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she for seven had her to wife 2034 and jesus answering said unto them the children of this world marry and are given in marriage 2035 but they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage 2036 neither can they die any more for they are equal unto the angels and are the children of god being the children of the resurrection 2037 now that the dead are raised even moses shewed at the bush when he calleth the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob 2038 for he is not a god of the dead but of the living for all live unto him 2039 then certain of the scribes answering said master thou hast well said 2040 and after that they durst not ask him any question at all 2041 and he said unto them how say they that christ is davids son 2042 and david himself saith in the book of psalms the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand 2043 till i make thine enemies thy footstool 2044 david therefore calleth him lord how is he then his son 2045 then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples 2046 beware of the scribes which desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the highest seats in the synagogues and the chief rooms at feasts 2047 which devour widows houses and for a shew make long prayers the same shall receive greater damnation 211 and he looked up and saw the rich men casting their gifts into the treasury 212 and he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two mites 213 and he said of a truth i say unto you that this poor widow hath cast in more than they all 214 for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of god but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had 215 and as some spake of the temple how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts he said 216 as for these things which ye behold the days will come in the which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down 217 and they asked him saying master but when shall these things be and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass 218 and he said take heed that ye be not deceived for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and the time draweth near go ye not therefore after them 219 but when ye shall hear of wars and commotions be not terrified for these things must first come to pass but the end is not by and by 2110 then said he unto them nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom 2111 and great earthquakes shall be in divers places and famines and pestilences and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven 2112 but before all these they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons being brought before kings and rulers for my names sake 2113 and it shall turn to you for a testimony 2114 settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what ye shall answer 2115 for i will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist 2116 and ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolks and friends and some of you shall they cause to be put to death 2117 and ye shall be hated of all men for my names sake 2118 but there shall not an hair of your head perish 2119 in your patience possess ye your souls 2120 and when ye shall see jerusalem compassed with armies then know that the desolation thereof is nigh 2121 then let them which are in judaea flee to the mountains and let them which are in the midst of it depart out and let not them that are in the countries enter thereinto 2122 for these be the days of vengeance that all things which are written may be fulfilled 2123 but woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days for there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people 2124 and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled 2125 and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring 2126 mens hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken 2127 and then shall they see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory 2128 and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh 2129 and he spake to them a parable behold the fig tree and all the trees 2130 when they now shoot forth ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now nigh at hand 2131 so likewise ye when ye see these things come to pass know ye that the kingdom of god is nigh at hand 2132 verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled 2133 heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away 2134 and take heed to yourselves lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and cares of this life and so that day come upon you unawares 2135 for as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth 2136 watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man 2137 and in the day time he was teaching in the temple and at night he went out and abode in the mount that is called the mount of olives 2138 and all the people came early in the morning to him in the temple for to hear him 221 now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which is called the passover 222 and the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him for they feared the people 223 then entered satan into judas surnamed iscariot being of the number of the twelve 224 and he went his way and communed with the chief priests and captains how he might betray him unto them 225 and they were glad and covenanted to give him money 226 and he promised and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude 227 then came the day of unleavened bread when the passover must be killed 228 and he sent peter and john saying go and prepare us the passover that we may eat 229 and they said unto him where wilt thou that we prepare 2210 and he said unto them behold when ye are entered into the city there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water follow him into the house where he entereth in 2211 and ye shall say unto the goodman of the house the master saith unto thee where is the guestchamber where i shall eat the passover with my disciples 2212 and he shall shew you a large upper room furnished there make ready 2213 and they went and found as he had said unto them and they made ready the passover 2214 and when the hour was come he sat down and the twelve apostles with him 2215 and he said unto them with desire i have desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer 2216 for i say unto you i will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of god 2217 and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves 2218 for i say unto you i will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god shall come 2219 and he took bread and gave thanks and brake it and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this do in remembrance of me 2220 likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the new testament in my blood which is shed for you 2221 but behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table 2222 and truly the son of man goeth as it was determined but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed 2223 and they began to enquire among themselves which of them it was that should do this thing 2224 and there was also a strife among them which of them should be accounted the greatest 2225 and he said unto them the kings of the gentiles exercise lordship over them and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors 2226 but ye shall not be so but he that is greatest among you let him be as the younger and he that is chief as he that doth serve 2227 for whether is greater he that sitteth at meat or he that serveth is not he that sitteth at meat but i am among you as he that serveth 2228 ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations 2229 and i appoint unto you a kingdom as my father hath appointed unto me 2230 that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel 2231 and the lord said simon simon behold satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat 2232 but i have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren 2233 and he said unto him lord i am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death 2234 and he said i tell thee peter the cock shall not crow this day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me 2235 and he said unto them when i sent you without purse and scrip and shoes lacked ye any thing and they said nothing 2236 then said he unto them but now he that hath a purse let him take it and likewise his scrip and he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one 2237 for i say unto you that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me and he was reckoned among the transgressors for the things concerning me have an end 2238 and they said lord behold here are two swords and he said unto them it is enough 2239 and he came out and went as he was wont to the mount of olives and his disciples also followed him 2240 and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation 2241 and he was withdrawn from them about a stones cast and kneeled down and prayed 2242 saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done 2243 and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him 2244 and being in an agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground 2245 and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow 2246 and said unto them why sleep ye rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation 2247 and while he yet spake behold a multitude and he that was called judas one of the twelve went before them and drew near unto jesus to kiss him 2248 but jesus said unto him judas betrayest thou the son of man with a kiss 2249 when they which were about him saw what would follow they said unto him lord shall we smite with the sword 2250 and one of them smote the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear 2251 and jesus answered and said suffer ye thus far and he touched his ear and healed him 2252 then jesus said unto the chief priests and captains of the temple and the elders which were come to him be ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves 2253 when i was daily with you in the temple ye stretched forth no hands against me but this is your hour and the power of darkness 2254 then took they him and led him and brought him into the high priests house and peter followed afar off 2255 and when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were set down together peter sat down among them 2256 but a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked upon him and said this man was also with him 2257 and he denied him saying woman i know him not 2258 and after a little while another saw him and said thou art also of them and peter said man i am not 2259 and about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed saying of a truth this fellow also was with him for he is a galilaean 2260 and peter said man i know not what thou sayest and immediately while he yet spake the cock crew 2261 and the lord turned and looked upon peter and peter remembered the word of the lord how he had said unto him before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice 2262 and peter went out and wept bitterly 2263 and the men that held jesus mocked him and smote him 2264 and when they had blindfolded him they struck him on the face and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smote thee 2265 and many other things blasphemously spake they against him 2266 and as soon as it was day the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together and led him into their council saying 2267 art thou the christ tell us and he said unto them if i tell you ye will not believe 2268 and if i also ask you ye will not answer me nor let me go 2269 hereafter shall the son of man sit on the right hand of the power of god 2270 then said they all art thou then the son of god and he said unto them ye say that i am 2271 and they said what need we any further witness for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth 231 and the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto pilate 232 and they began to accuse him saying we found this fellow perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to caesar saying that he himself is christ a king 233 and pilate asked him saying art thou the king of the jews and he answered him and said thou sayest it 234 then said pilate to the chief priests and to the people i find no fault in this man 235 and they were the more fierce saying he stirreth up the people teaching throughout all jewry beginning from galilee to this place 236 when pilate heard of galilee he asked whether the man were a galilaean 237 and as soon as he knew that he belonged unto herods jurisdiction he sent him to herod who himself also was at jerusalem at that time 238 and when herod saw jesus he was exceeding glad for he was desirous to see him of a long season because he had heard many things of him and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him 239 then he questioned with him in many words but he answered him nothing 2310 and the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him 2311 and herod with his men of war set him at nought and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to pilate 2312 and the same day pilate and herod were made friends together for before they were at enmity between themselves 2313 and pilate when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people 2314 said unto them ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth the people and behold i having examined him before you have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him 2315 no nor yet herod for i sent you to him and lo nothing worthy of death is done unto him 2316 i will therefore chastise him and release him 2317 for of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast 2318 and they cried out all at once saying away with this man and release unto us barabbas 2319 who for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder was cast into prison 2320 pilate therefore willing to release jesus spake again to them 2321 but they cried saying crucify him crucify him 2322 and he said unto them the third time why what evil hath he done i have found no cause of death in him i will therefore chastise him and let him go 2323 and they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified and the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed 2324 and pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required 2325 and he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison whom they had desired but he delivered jesus to their will 2326 and as they led him away they laid hold upon one simon a cyrenian coming out of the country and on him they laid the cross that he might bear it after jesus 2327 and there followed him a great company of people and of women which also bewailed and lamented him 2328 but jesus turning unto them said daughters of jerusalem weep not for me but weep for yourselves and for your children 2329 for behold the days are coming in the which they shall say blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the paps which never gave suck 2330 then shall they begin to say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us 2331 for if they do these things in a green tree what shall be done in the dry 2332 and there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death 2333 and when they were come to the place which is called calvary there they crucified him and the malefactors one on the right hand and the other on the left 2334 then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots 2335 and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with them derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be christ the chosen of god 2336 and the soldiers also mocked him coming to him and offering him vinegar 2337 and saying if thou be the king of the jews save thyself 2338 and a superscription also was written over him in letters of greek and latin and hebrew this is the king of the jews 2339 and one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be christ save thyself and us 2340 but the other answering rebuked him saying dost not thou fear god seeing thou art in the same condemnation 2341 and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss 2342 and he said unto jesus lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom 2343 and jesus said unto him verily i say unto thee to day shalt thou be with me in paradise 2344 and it was about the sixth hour and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour 2345 and the sun was darkened and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst 2346 and when jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost 2347 now when the centurion saw what was done he glorified god saying certainly this was a righteous man 2348 and all the people that came together to that sight beholding the things which were done smote their breasts and returned 2349 and all his acquaintance and the women that followed him from galilee stood afar off beholding these things 2350 and behold there was a man named joseph a counsellor and he was a good man and a just 2351 the same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them he was of arimathaea a city of the jews who also himself waited for the kingdom of god 2352 this man went unto pilate and begged the body of jesus 2353 and he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone wherein never man before was laid 2354 and that day was the preparation and the sabbath drew on 2355 and the women also which came with him from galilee followed after and beheld the sepulchre and how his body was laid 2356 and they returned and prepared spices and ointments and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment 241 now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with them 242 and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre 243 and they entered in and found not the body of the lord jesus 244 and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments 245 and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead 246 he is not here but is risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in galilee 247 saying the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again 248 and they remembered his words 249 and returned from the sepulchre and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the rest 2410 it was mary magdalene and joanna and mary the mother of james and other women that were with them which told these things unto the apostles 2411 and their words seemed to them as idle tales and they believed them not 2412 then arose peter and ran unto the sepulchre and stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass 2413 and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emmaus which was from jerusalem about threescore furlongs 2414 and they talked together of all these things which had happened 2415 and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned jesus himself drew near and went with them 2416 but their eyes were holden that they should not know him 2417 and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad 2418 and the one of them whose name was cleopas answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in jerusalem and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days 2419 and he said unto them what things and they said unto him concerning jesus of nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all the people 2420 and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him 2421 but we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed israel and beside all this to day is the third day since these things were done 2422 yea and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulchre 2423 and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive 2424 and certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not 2425 then he said unto them o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken 2426 ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory 2427 and beginning at moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself 2428 and they drew nigh unto the village whither they went and he made as though he would have gone further 2429 but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry with them 2430 and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and blessed it and brake and gave to them 2431 and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight 2432 and they said one to another did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures 2433 and they rose up the same hour and returned to jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and them that were with them 2434 saying the lord is risen indeed and hath appeared to simon 2435 and they told what things were done in the way and how he was known of them in breaking of bread 2436 and as they thus spake jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you 2437 but they were terrified and affrighted and supposed that they had seen a spirit 2438 and he said unto them why are ye troubled and why do thoughts arise in your hearts 2439 behold my hands and my feet that it is i myself handle me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have 2440 and when he had thus spoken he shewed them his hands and his feet 2441 and while they yet believed not for joy and wondered he said unto them have ye here any meat 2442 and they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of an honeycomb 2443 and he took it and did eat before them 2444 and he said unto them these are the words which i spake unto you while i was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me 2445 then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures 2446 and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day 2447 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem 2448 and ye are witnesses of these things 2449 and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high 2450 and he led them out as far as to bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them 2451 and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven 2452 and they worshipped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy 2453 and were continually in the temple praising and blessing god amen the gospel according to saint john 11 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god 12 the same was in the beginning with god 13 all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made that was made 14 in him was life and the life was the light of men 15 and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not 16 there was a man sent from god whose name was john 17 the same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe 18 he was not that light but was sent to bear witness of that light 19 that was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world 110 he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not 111 he came unto his own and his own received him not 112 but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name 113 which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god 114 and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth 115 john bare witness of him and cried saying this was he of whom i spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me 116 and of his fulness have all we received and grace for grace 117 for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ 118 no man hath seen god at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him 119 and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who art thou 120 and he confessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ 121 and they asked him what then art thou elias and he saith i am not art thou that prophet and he answered no 122 then said they unto him who art thou that we may give an answer to them that sent us what sayest thou of thyself 123 he said i am the voice of one crying in the wilderness make straight the way of the lord as said the prophet esaias 124 and they which were sent were of the pharisees 125 and they asked him and said unto him why baptizest thou then if thou be not that christ nor elias neither that prophet 126 john answered them saying i baptize with water but there standeth one among you whom ye know not 127 he it is who coming after me is preferred before me whose shoes latchet i am not worthy to unloose 128 these things were done in bethabara beyond jordan where john was baptizing 129 the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world 130 this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me 131 and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore am i come baptizing with water 132 and john bare record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him 133 and i knew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptizeth with the holy ghost 134 and i saw and bare record that this is the son of god 135 again the next day after john stood and two of his disciples 136 and looking upon jesus as he walked he saith behold the lamb of god 137 and the two disciples heard him speak and they followed jesus 138 then jesus turned and saw them following and saith unto them what seek ye they said unto him rabbi which is to say being interpreted master where dwellest thou 139 he saith unto them come and see they came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day for it was about the tenth hour 140 one of the two which heard john speak and followed him was andrew simon peters brother 141 he first findeth his own brother simon and saith unto him we have found the messias which is being interpreted the christ 142 and he brought him to jesus and when jesus beheld him he said thou art simon the son of jona thou shalt be called cephas which is by interpretation a stone 143 the day following jesus would go forth into galilee and findeth philip and saith unto him follow me 144 now philip was of bethsaida the city of andrew and peter 145 philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did write jesus of nazareth the son of joseph 146 and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth philip saith unto him come and see 147 jesus saw nathanael coming to him and saith of him behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile 148 nathanael saith unto him whence knowest thou me jesus answered and said unto him before that philip called thee when thou wast under the fig tree i saw thee 149 nathanael answered and saith unto him rabbi thou art the son of god thou art the king of israel 150 jesus answered and said unto him because i said unto thee i saw thee under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater things than these 151 and he saith unto him verily verily i say unto you hereafter ye shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man 21 and the third day there was a marriage in cana of galilee and the mother of jesus was there 22 and both jesus was called and his disciples to the marriage 23 and when they wanted wine the mother of jesus saith unto him they have no wine 24 jesus saith unto her woman what have i to do with thee mine hour is not yet come 25 his mother saith unto the servants whatsoever he saith unto you do it 26 and there were set there six waterpots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the jews containing two or three firkins apiece 27 jesus saith unto them fill the waterpots with water and they filled them up to the brim 28 and he saith unto them draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast and they bare it 29 when the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not whence it was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom 210 and saith unto him every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine and when men have well drunk then that which is worse but thou hast kept the good wine until now 211 this beginning of miracles did jesus in cana of galilee and manifested forth his glory and his disciples believed on him 212 after this he went down to capernaum he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples and they continued there not many days 213 and the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem 214 and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves and the changers of money sitting 215 and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables 216 and said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my fathers house an house of merchandise 217 and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up 218 then answered the jews and said unto him what sign shewest thou unto us seeing that thou doest these things 219 jesus answered and said unto them destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up 220 then said the jews forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days 221 but he spake of the temple of his body 222 when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which jesus had said 223 now when he was in jerusalem at the passover in the feast day many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did 224 but jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all men 225 and needed not that any should testify of man for he knew what was in man 31 there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews 32 the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from god for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except god be with him 33 jesus answered and said unto him verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god 34 nicodemus saith unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mothers womb and be born 35 jesus answered verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god 36 that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit 37 marvel not that i said unto thee ye must be born again 38 the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the spirit 39 nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be 310 jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of israel and knowest not these things 311 verily verily i say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witness 312 if i have told you earthly things and ye believe not how shall ye believe if i tell you of heavenly things 313 and no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven 314 and as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up 315 that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life 316 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life 317 for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved 318 he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten son of god 319 and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil 320 for every one that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved 321 but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought in god 322 after these things came jesus and his disciples into the land of judaea and there he tarried with them and baptized 323 and john also was baptizing in aenon near to salim because there was much water there and they came and were baptized 324 for john was not yet cast into prison 325 then there arose a question between some of johns disciples and the jews about purifying 326 and they came unto john and said unto him rabbi he that was with thee beyond jordan to whom thou barest witness behold the same baptizeth and all men come to him 327 john answered and said a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven 328 ye yourselves bear me witness that i said i am not the christ but that i am sent before him 329 he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegrooms voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled 330 he must increase but i must decrease 331 he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is earthly and speaketh of the earth he that cometh from heaven is above all 332 and what he hath seen and heard that he testifieth and no man receiveth his testimony 333 he that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that god is true 334 for he whom god hath sent speaketh the words of god for god giveth not the spirit by measure unto him 335 the father loveth the son and hath given all things into his hand 336 he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him 41 when therefore the lord knew how the pharisees had heard that jesus made and baptized more disciples than john 42 though jesus himself baptized not but his disciples 43 he left judaea and departed again into galilee 44 and he must needs go through samaria 45 then cometh he to a city of samaria which is called sychar near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his son joseph 46 now jacobs well was there jesus therefore being wearied with his journey sat thus on the well and it was about the sixth hour 47 there cometh a woman of samaria to draw water jesus saith unto her give me to drink 48 for his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat 49 then saith the woman of samaria unto him how is it that thou being a jew askest drink of me which am a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the samaritans 410 jesus answered and said unto her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldest have asked of him and he would have given thee living water 411 the woman saith unto him sir thou hast nothing to draw with and the well is deep from whence then hast thou that living water 412 art thou greater than our father jacob which gave us the well and drank thereof himself and his children and his cattle 413 jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again 414 but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life 415 the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that i thirst not neither come hither to draw 416 jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither 417 the woman answered and said i have no husband jesus said unto her thou hast well said i have no husband 418 for thou hast had five husbands and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband in that saidst thou truly 419 the woman saith unto him sir i perceive that thou art a prophet 420 our fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye say that in jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship 421 jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour cometh when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father 422 ye worship ye know not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the jews 423 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him 424 god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth 425 the woman saith unto him i know that messias cometh which is called christ when he is come he will tell us all things 426 jesus saith unto her i that speak unto thee am he 427 and upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her 428 the woman then left her waterpot and went her way into the city and saith to the men 429 come see a man which told me all things that ever i did is not this the christ 430 then they went out of the city and came unto him 431 in the mean while his disciples prayed him saying master eat 432 but he said unto them i have meat to eat that ye know not of 433 therefore said the disciples one to another hath any man brought him ought to eat 434 jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work 435 say not ye there are yet four months and then cometh harvest behold i say unto you lift up your eyes and look on the fields for they are white already to harvest 436 and he that reapeth receiveth wages and gathereth fruit unto life eternal that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together 437 and herein is that saying true one soweth and another reapeth 438 i sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour other men laboured and ye are entered into their labours 439 and many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever i did 440 so when the samaritans were come unto him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two days 441 and many more believed because of his own word 442 and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the christ the saviour of the world 443 now after two days he departed thence and went into galilee 444 for jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in his own country 445 then when he was come into galilee the galilaeans received him having seen all the things that he did at jerusalem at the feast for they also went unto the feast 446 so jesus came again into cana of galilee where he made the water wine and there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at capernaum 447 when he heard that jesus was come out of judaea into galilee he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son for he was at the point of death 448 then said jesus unto him except ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe 449 the nobleman saith unto him sir come down ere my child die 450 jesus saith unto him go thy way thy son liveth and the man believed the word that jesus had spoken unto him and he went his way 451 and as he was now going down his servants met him and told him saying thy son liveth 452 then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend and they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him 453 so the father knew that it was at the same hour in the which jesus said unto him thy son liveth and himself believed and his whole house 454 this is again the second miracle that jesus did when he was come out of judaea into galilee 51 after this there was a feast of the jews and jesus went up to jerusalem 52 now there is at jerusalem by the sheep market a pool which is called in the hebrew tongue bethesda having five porches 53 in these lay a great multitude of impotent folk of blind halt withered waiting for the moving of the water 54 for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and troubled the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had 55 and a certain man was there which had an infirmity thirty and eight years 56 when jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he saith unto him wilt thou be made whole 57 the impotent man answered him sir i have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while i am coming another steppeth down before me 58 jesus saith unto him rise take up thy bed and walk 59 and immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the sabbath 510 the jews therefore said unto him that was cured it is the sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed 511 he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk 512 then asked they him what man is that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk 513 and he that was healed wist not who it was for jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place 514 afterward jesus findeth him in the temple and said unto him behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto thee 515 the man departed and told the jews that it was jesus which had made him whole 516 and therefore did the jews persecute jesus and sought to slay him because he had done these things on the sabbath day 517 but jesus answered them my father worketh hitherto and i work 518 therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself equal with god 519 then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise 520 for the father loveth the son and sheweth him all things that himself doeth and he will shew him greater works than these that ye may marvel 521 for as the father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them even so the son quickeneth whom he will 522 for the father judgeth no man but hath committed all judgment unto the son 523 that all men should honour the son even as they honour the father he that honoureth not the son honoureth not the father which hath sent him 524 verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life 525 verily verily i say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live 526 for as the father hath life in himself so hath he given to the son to have life in himself 527 and hath given him authority to execute judgment also because he is the son of man 528 marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice 529 and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation 530 i can of mine own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which hath sent me 531 if i bear witness of myself my witness is not true 532 there is another that beareth witness of me and i know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true 533 ye sent unto john and he bare witness unto the truth 534 but i receive not testimony from man but these things i say that ye might be saved 535 he was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light 536 but i have greater witness than that of john for the works which the father hath given me to finish the same works that i do bear witness of me that the father hath sent me 537 and the father himself which hath sent me hath borne witness of me ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape 538 and ye have not his word abiding in you for whom he hath sent him ye believe not 539 search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me 540 and ye will not come to me that ye might have life 541 i receive not honour from men 542 but i know you that ye have not the love of god in you 543 i am come in my fathers name and ye receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye will receive 544 how can ye believe which receive honour one of another and seek not the honour that cometh from god only 545 do not think that i will accuse you to the father there is one that accuseth you even moses in whom ye trust 546 for had ye believed moses ye would have believed me for he wrote of me 547 but if ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words 61 after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee which is the sea of tiberias 62 and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased 63 and jesus went up into a mountain and there he sat with his disciples 64 and the passover a feast of the jews was nigh 65 when jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he saith unto philip whence shall we buy bread that these may eat 66 and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do 67 philip answered him two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little 68 one of his disciples andrew simon peters brother saith unto him 69 there is a lad here which hath five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many 610 and jesus said make the men sit down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in number about five thousand 611 and jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as much as they would 612 when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost 613 therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten 614 then those men when they had seen the miracle that jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world 615 when jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone 616 and when even was now come his disciples went down unto the sea 617 and entered into a ship and went over the sea toward capernaum and it was now dark and jesus was not come to them 618 and the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew 619 so when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs they see jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid 620 but he saith unto them it is i be not afraid 621 then they willingly received him into the ship and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went 622 the day following when the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there save that one whereinto his disciples were entered and that jesus went not with his disciples into the boat but that his disciples were gone away alone 623 howbeit there came other boats from tiberias nigh unto the place where they did eat bread after that the lord had given thanks 624 when the people therefore saw that jesus was not there neither his disciples they also took shipping and came to capernaum seeking for jesus 625 and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him rabbi when camest thou hither 626 jesus answered them and said verily verily i say unto you ye seek me not because ye saw the miracles but because ye did eat of the loaves and were filled 627 labour not for the meat which perisheth but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life which the son of man shall give unto you for him hath god the father sealed 628 then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of god 629 jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of god that ye believe on him whom he hath sent 630 they said therefore unto him what sign shewest thou then that we may see and believe thee what dost thou work 631 our fathers did eat manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat 632 then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven 633 for the bread of god is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world 634 then said they unto him lord evermore give us this bread 635 and jesus said unto them i am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst 636 but i said unto you that ye also have seen me and believe not 637 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out 638 for i came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me 639 and this is the fathers will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day 640 and this is the will of him that sent me that every one which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day 641 the jews then murmured at him because he said i am the bread which came down from heaven 642 and they said is not this jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith i came down from heaven 643 jesus therefore answered and said unto them murmur not among yourselves 644 no man can come to me except the father which hath sent me draw him and i will raise him up at the last day 645 it is written in the prophets and they shall be all taught of god every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father cometh unto me 646 not that any man hath seen the father save he which is of god he hath seen the father 647 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me hath everlasting life 648 i am that bread of life 649 your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and are dead 650 this is the bread which cometh down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die 651 i am the living bread which came down from heaven if any man eat of this bread he shall live for ever and the bread that i will give is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world 652 the jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat 653 then jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you except ye eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood ye have no life in you 654 whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day 655 for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed 656 he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and i in him 657 as the living father hath sent me and i live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me 658 this is that bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat manna and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever 659 these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in capernaum 660 many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said this is an hard saying who can hear it 661 when jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them doth this offend you 662 what and if ye shall see the son of man ascend up where he was before 663 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that i speak unto you they are spirit and they are life 664 but there are some of you that believe not for jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believed not and who should betray him 665 and he said therefore said i unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father 666 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him 667 then said jesus unto the twelve will ye also go away 668 then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life 669 and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god 670 jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is a devil 671 he spake of judas iscariot the son of simon for he it was that should betray him being one of the twelve 71 after these things jesus walked in galilee for he would not walk in jewry because the jews sought to kill him 72 now the jews feast of tabernacles was at hand 73 his brethren therefore said unto him depart hence and go into judaea that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest 74 for there is no man that doeth any thing in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things shew thyself to the world 75 for neither did his brethren believe in him 76 then jesus said unto them my time is not yet come but your time is alway ready 77 the world cannot hate you but me it hateth because i testify of it that the works thereof are evil 78 go ye up unto this feast i go not up yet unto this feast for my time is not yet full come 79 when he had said these words unto them he abode still in galilee 710 but when his brethren were gone up then went he also up unto the feast not openly but as it were in secret 711 then the jews sought him at the feast and said where is he 712 and there was much murmuring among the people concerning him for some said he is a good man others said nay but he deceiveth the people 713 howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the jews 714 now about the midst of the feast jesus went up into the temple and taught 715 and the jews marvelled saying how knoweth this man letters having never learned 716 jesus answered them and said my doctrine is not mine but his that sent me 717 if any man will do his will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself 718 he that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory but he that seeketh his glory that sent him the same is true and no unrighteousness is in him 719 did not moses give you the law and yet none of you keepeth the law why go ye about to kill me 720 the people answered and said thou hast a devil who goeth about to kill thee 721 jesus answered and said unto them i have done one work and ye all marvel 722 moses therefore gave unto you circumcision not because it is of moses but of the fathers and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man 723 if a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision that the law of moses should not be broken are ye angry at me because i have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day 724 judge not according to the appearance but judge righteous judgment 725 then said some of them of jerusalem is not this he whom they seek to kill 726 but lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto him do the rulers know indeed that this is the very christ 727 howbeit we know this man whence he is but when christ cometh no man knoweth whence he is 728 then cried jesus in the temple as he taught saying ye both know me and ye know whence i am and i am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom ye know not 729 but i know him for i am from him and he hath sent me 730 then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come 731 and many of the people believed on him and said when christ cometh will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done 732 the pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him and the pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him 733 then said jesus unto them yet a little while am i with you and then i go unto him that sent me 734 ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come 735 then said the jews among themselves whither will he go that we shall not find him will he go unto the dispersed among the gentiles and teach the gentiles 736 what manner of saying is this that he said ye shall seek me and shall not find me and where i am thither ye cannot come 737 in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink 738 he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water 739 but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified 740 many of the people therefore when they heard this saying said of a truth this is the prophet 741 others said this is the christ but some said shall christ come out of galilee 742 hath not the scripture said that christ cometh of the seed of david and out of the town of bethlehem where david was 743 so there was a division among the people because of him 744 and some of them would have taken him but no man laid hands on him 745 then came the officers to the chief priests and pharisees and they said unto them why have ye not brought him 746 the officers answered never man spake like this man 747 then answered them the pharisees are ye also deceived 748 have any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed on him 749 but this people who knoweth not the law are cursed 750 nicodemus saith unto them he that came to jesus by night being one of them 751 doth our law judge any man before it hear him and know what he doeth 752 they answered and said unto him art thou also of galilee search and look for out of galilee ariseth no prophet 753 and every man went unto his own house 81 jesus went unto the mount of olives 82 and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them 83 and the scribes and pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst 84 they say unto him master this woman was taken in adultery in the very act 85 now moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou 86 this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not 87 so when they continued asking him he lifted up himself and said unto them he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone at her 88 and again he stooped down and wrote on the ground 89 and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience went out one by one beginning at the eldest even unto the last and jesus was left alone and the woman standing in the midst 810 when jesus had lifted up himself and saw none but the woman he said unto her woman where are those thine accusers hath no man condemned thee 811 she said no man lord and jesus said unto her neither do i condemn thee go and sin no more 812 then spake jesus again unto them saying i am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life 813 the pharisees therefore said unto him thou bearest record of thyself thy record is not true 814 jesus answered and said unto them though i bear record of myself yet my record is true for i know whence i came and whither i go but ye cannot tell whence i come and whither i go 815 ye judge after the flesh i judge no man 816 and yet if i judge my judgment is true for i am not alone but i and the father that sent me 817 it is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true 818 i am one that bear witness of myself and the father that sent me beareth witness of me 819 then said they unto him where is thy father jesus answered ye neither know me nor my father if ye had known me ye should have known my father also 820 these words spake jesus in the treasury as he taught in the temple and no man laid hands on him for his hour was not yet come 821 then said jesus again unto them i go my way and ye shall seek me and shall die in your sins whither i go ye cannot come 822 then said the jews will he kill himself because he saith whither i go ye cannot come 823 and he said unto them ye are from beneath i am from above ye are of this world i am not of this world 824 i said therefore unto you that ye shall die in your sins for if ye believe not that i am he ye shall die in your sins 825 then said they unto him who art thou and jesus saith unto them even the same that i said unto you from the beginning 826 i have many things to say and to judge of you but he that sent me is true and i speak to the world those things which i have heard of him 827 they understood not that he spake to them of the father 828 then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall ye know that i am he and that i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things 829 and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone for i do always those things that please him 830 as he spake these words many believed on him 831 then said jesus to those jews which believed on him if ye continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed 832 and ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free 833 they answered him we be abrahams seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou ye shall be made free 834 jesus answered them verily verily i say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin 835 and the servant abideth not in the house for ever but the son abideth ever 836 if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed 837 i know that ye are abrahams seed but ye seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you 838 i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that which ye have seen with your father 839 they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesus saith unto them if ye were abrahams children ye would do the works of abraham 840 but now ye seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which i have heard of god this did not abraham 841 ye do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god 842 jesus said unto them if god were your father ye would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me 843 why do ye not understand my speech even because ye cannot hear my word 844 ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it 845 and because i tell you the truth ye believe me not 846 which of you convinceth me of sin and if i say the truth why do ye not believe me 847 he that is of god heareth gods words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god 848 then answered the jews and said unto him say we not well that thou art a samaritan and hast a devil 849 jesus answered i have not a devil but i honour my father and ye do dishonour me 850 and i seek not mine own glory there is one that seeketh and judgeth 851 verily verily i say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall never see death 852 then said the jews unto him now we know that thou hast a devil abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death 853 art thou greater than our father abraham which is dead and the prophets are dead whom makest thou thyself 854 jesus answered if i honour myself my honour is nothing it is my father that honoureth me of whom ye say that he is your god 855 yet ye have not known him but i know him and if i should say i know him not i shall be a liar like unto you but i know him and keep his saying 856 your father abraham rejoiced to see my day and he saw it and was glad 857 then said the jews unto him thou art not yet fifty years old and hast thou seen abraham 858 jesus said unto them verily verily i say unto you before abraham was i am 859 then took they up stones to cast at him but jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and so passed by 91 and as jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth 92 and his disciples asked him saying master who did sin this man or his parents that he was born blind 93 jesus answered neither hath this man sinned nor his parents but that the works of god should be made manifest in him 94 i must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work 95 as long as i am in the world i am the light of the world 96 when he had thus spoken he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay 97 and said unto him go wash in the pool of siloam which is by interpretation sent he went his way therefore and washed and came seeing 98 the neighbours therefore and they which before had seen him that he was blind said is not this he that sat and begged 99 some said this is he others said he is like him but he said i am he 910 therefore said they unto him how were thine eyes opened 911 he answered and said a man that is called jesus made clay and anointed mine eyes and said unto me go to the pool of siloam and wash and i went and washed and i received sight 912 then said they unto him where is he he said i know not 913 they brought to the pharisees him that aforetime was blind 914 and it was the sabbath day when jesus made the clay and opened his eyes 915 then again the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight he said unto them he put clay upon mine eyes and i washed and do see 916 therefore said some of the pharisees this man is not of god because he keepeth not the sabbath day others said how can a man that is a sinner do such miracles and there was a division among them 917 they say unto the blind man again what sayest thou of him that he hath opened thine eyes he said he is a prophet 918 but the jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him that had received his sight 919 and they asked them saying is this your son who ye say was born blind how then doth he now see 920 his parents answered them and said we know that this is our son and that he was born blind 921 but by what means he now seeth we know not or who hath opened his eyes we know not he is of age ask him he shall speak for himself 922 these words spake his parents because they feared the jews for the jews had agreed already that if any man did confess that he was christ he should be put out of the synagogue 923 therefore said his parents he is of age ask him 924 then again called they the man that was blind and said unto him give god the praise we know that this man is a sinner 925 he answered and said whether he be a sinner or no i know not one thing i know that whereas i was blind now i see 926 then said they to him again what did he to thee how opened he thine eyes 927 he answered them i have told you already and ye did not hear wherefore would ye hear it again will ye also be his disciples 928 then they reviled him and said thou art his disciple but we are moses disciples 929 we know that god spake unto moses as for this fellow we know not from whence he is 930 the man answered and said unto them why herein is a marvellous thing that ye know not from whence he is and yet he hath opened mine eyes 931 now we know that god heareth not sinners but if any man be a worshipper of god and doeth his will him he heareth 932 since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind 933 if this man were not of god he could do nothing 934 they answered and said unto him thou wast altogether born in sins and dost thou teach us and they cast him out 935 jesus heard that they had cast him out and when he had found him he said unto him dost thou believe on the son of god 936 he answered and said who is he lord that i might believe on him 937 and jesus said unto him thou hast both seen him and it is he that talketh with thee 938 and he said lord i believe and he worshipped him 939 and jesus said for judgment i am come into this world that they which see not might see and that they which see might be made blind 940 and some of the pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also 941 jesus said unto them if ye were blind ye should have no sin but now ye say we see therefore your sin remaineth 101 verily verily i say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber 102 but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep 103 to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out 104 and when he putteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice 105 and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers 106 this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them 107 then said jesus unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep 108 all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them 109 i am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture 1010 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly 1011 i am the good shepherd the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep 1012 but he that is an hireling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep are not seeth the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and the wolf catcheth them and scattereth the sheep 1013 the hireling fleeth because he is an hireling and careth not for the sheep 1014 i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine 1015 as the father knoweth me even so know i the father and i lay down my life for the sheep 1016 and other sheep i have which are not of this fold them also i must bring and they shall hear my voice and there shall be one fold and one shepherd 1017 therefore doth my father love me because i lay down my life that i might take it again 1018 no man taketh it from me but i lay it down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have i received of my father 1019 there was a division therefore again among the jews for these sayings 1020 and many of them said he hath a devil and is mad why hear ye him 1021 others said these are not the words of him that hath a devil can a devil open the eyes of the blind 1022 and it was at jerusalem the feast of the dedication and it was winter 1023 and jesus walked in the temple in solomons porch 1024 then came the jews round about him and said unto him how long dost thou make us to doubt if thou be the christ tell us plainly 1025 jesus answered them i told you and ye believed not the works that i do in my fathers name they bear witness of me 1026 but ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep as i said unto you 1027 my sheep hear my voice and i know them and they follow me 1028 and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand 1029 my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my fathers hand 1030 i and my father are one 1031 then the jews took up stones again to stone him 1032 jesus answered them many good works have i shewed you from my father for which of those works do ye stone me 1033 the jews answered him saying for a good work we stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man makest thyself god 1034 jesus answered them is it not written in your law i said ye are gods 1035 if he called them gods unto whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken 1036 say ye of him whom the father hath sanctified and sent into the world thou blasphemest because i said i am the son of god 1037 if i do not the works of my father believe me not 1038 but if i do though ye believe not me believe the works that ye may know and believe that the father is in me and i in him 1039 therefore they sought again to take him but he escaped out of their hand 1040 and went away again beyond jordan into the place where john at first baptized and there he abode 1041 and many resorted unto him and said john did no miracle but all things that john spake of this man were true 1042 and many believed on him there 111 now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister martha 112 it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick 113 therefore his sisters sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick 114 when jesus heard that he said this sickness is not unto death but for the glory of god that the son of god might be glorified thereby 115 now jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus 116 when he had heard therefore that he was sick he abode two days still in the same place where he was 117 then after that saith he to his disciples let us go into judaea again 118 his disciples say unto him master the jews of late sought to stone thee and goest thou thither again 119 jesus answered are there not twelve hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not because he seeth the light of this world 1110 but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there is no light in him 1111 these things said he and after that he saith unto them our friend lazarus sleepeth but i go that i may awake him out of sleep 1112 then said his disciples lord if he sleep he shall do well 1113 howbeit jesus spake of his death but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep 1114 then said jesus unto them plainly lazarus is dead 1115 and i am glad for your sakes that i was not there to the intent ye may believe nevertheless let us go unto him 1116 then said thomas which is called didymus unto his fellowdisciples let us also go that we may die with him 1117 then when jesus came he found that he had lain in the grave four days already 1118 now bethany was nigh unto jerusalem about fifteen furlongs off 1119 and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brother 1120 then martha as soon as she heard that jesus was coming went and met him but mary sat still in the house 1121 then said martha unto jesus lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died 1122 but i know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of god god will give it thee 1123 jesus saith unto her thy brother shall rise again 1124 martha saith unto him i know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day 1125 jesus said unto her i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live 1126 and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believest thou this 1127 she saith unto him yea lord i believe that thou art the christ the son of god which should come into the world 1128 and when she had so said she went her way and called mary her sister secretly saying the master is come and calleth for thee 1129 as soon as she heard that she arose quickly and came unto him 1130 now jesus was not yet come into the town but was in that place where martha met him 1131 the jews then which were with her in the house and comforted her when they saw mary that she rose up hastily and went out followed her saying she goeth unto the grave to weep there 1132 then when mary was come where jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet saying unto him lord if thou hadst been here my brother had not died 1133 when jesus therefore saw her weeping and the jews also weeping which came with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled 1134 and said where have ye laid him they said unto him lord come and see 1135 jesus wept 1136 then said the jews behold how he loved him 1137 and some of them said could not this man which opened the eyes of the blind have caused that even this man should not have died 1138 jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave it was a cave and a stone lay upon it 1139 jesus said take ye away the stone martha the sister of him that was dead saith unto him lord by this time he stinketh for he hath been dead four days 1140 jesus saith unto her said i not unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of god 1141 then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid and jesus lifted up his eyes and said father i thank thee that thou hast heard me 1142 and i knew that thou hearest me always but because of the people which stand by i said it that they may believe that thou hast sent me 1143 and when he thus had spoken he cried with a loud voice lazarus come forth 1144 and he that was dead came forth bound hand and foot with graveclothes and his face was bound about with a napkin jesus saith unto them loose him and let him go 1145 then many of the jews which came to mary and had seen the things which jesus did believed on him 1146 but some of them went their ways to the pharisees and told them what things jesus had done 1147 then gathered the chief priests and the pharisees a council and said what do we for this man doeth many miracles 1148 if we let him thus alone all men will believe on him and the romans shall come and take away both our place and nation 1149 and one of them named caiaphas being the high priest that same year said unto them ye know nothing at all 1150 nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the whole nation perish not 1151 and this spake he not of himself but being high priest that year he prophesied that jesus should die for that nation 1152 and not for that nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of god that were scattered abroad 1153 then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death 1154 jesus therefore walked no more openly among the jews but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called ephraim and there continued with his disciples 1155 and the jews passover was nigh at hand and many went out of the country up to jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves 1156 then sought they for jesus and spake among themselves as they stood in the temple what think ye that he will not come to the feast 1157 now both the chief priests and the pharisees had given a commandment that if any man knew where he were he should shew it that they might take him 121 then jesus six days before the passover came to bethany where lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead 122 there they made him a supper and martha served but lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him 123 then took mary a pound of ointment of spikenard very costly and anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment 124 then saith one of his disciples judas iscariot simons son which should betray him 125 why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor 126 this he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bare what was put therein 127 then said jesus let her alone against the day of my burying hath she kept this 128 for the poor always ye have with you but me ye have not always 129 much people of the jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for jesus sake only but that they might see lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead 1210 but the chief priests consulted that they might put lazarus also to death 1211 because that by reason of him many of the jews went away and believed on jesus 1212 on the next day much people that were come to the feast when they heard that jesus was coming to jerusalem 1213 took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried hosanna blessed is the king of israel that cometh in the name of the lord 1214 and jesus when he had found a young ass sat thereon as it is written 1215 fear not daughter of sion behold thy king cometh sitting on an asss colt 1216 these things understood not his disciples at the first but when jesus was glorified then remembered they that these things were written of him and that they had done these things unto him 1217 the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead bare record 1218 for this cause the people also met him for that they heard that he had done this miracle 1219 the pharisees therefore said among themselves perceive ye how ye prevail nothing behold the world is gone after him 1220 and there were certain greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast 1221 the same came therefore to philip which was of bethsaida of galilee and desired him saying sir we would see jesus 1222 philip cometh and telleth andrew and again andrew and philip tell jesus 1223 and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the son of man should be glorified 1224 verily verily i say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit 1225 he that loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal 1226 if any man serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall also my servant be if any man serve me him will my father honour 1227 now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this cause came i unto this hour 1228 father glorify thy name then came there a voice from heaven saying i have both glorified it and will glorify it again 1229 the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered others said an angel spake to him 1230 jesus answered and said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes 1231 now is the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out 1232 and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me 1233 this he said signifying what death he should die 1234 the people answered him we have heard out of the law that christ abideth for ever and how sayest thou the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man 1235 then jesus said unto them yet a little while is the light with you walk while ye have the light lest darkness come upon you for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth 1236 while ye have light believe in the light that ye may be the children of light these things spake jesus and departed and did hide himself from them 1237 but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on him 1238 that the saying of esaias the prophet might be fulfilled which he spake lord who hath believed our report and to whom hath the arm of the lord been revealed 1239 therefore they could not believe because that esaias said again 1240 he hath blinded their eyes and hardened their heart that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted and i should heal them 1241 these things said esaias when he saw his glory and spake of him 1242 nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him but because of the pharisees they did not confess him lest they should be put out of the synagogue 1243 for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of god 1244 jesus cried and said he that believeth on me believeth not on me but on him that sent me 1245 and he that seeth me seeth him that sent me 1246 i am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness 1247 and if any man hear my words and believe not i judge him not for i came not to judge the world but to save the world 1248 he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him the word that i have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day 1249 for i have not spoken of myself but the father which sent me he gave me a commandment what i should say and what i should speak 1250 and i know that his commandment is life everlasting whatsoever i speak therefore even as the father said unto me so i speak 131 now before the feast of the passover when jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end 132 and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of judas iscariot simons son to betray him 133 jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from god and went to god 134 he riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself 135 after that he poureth water into a bason and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded 136 then cometh he to simon peter and peter saith unto him lord dost thou wash my feet 137 jesus answered and said unto him what i do thou knowest not now but thou shalt know hereafter 138 peter saith unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i wash thee not thou hast no part with me 139 simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head 1310 jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but is clean every whit and ye are clean but not all 1311 for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean 1312 so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you 1313 ye call me master and lord and ye say well for so i am 1314 if i then your lord and master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one anothers feet 1315 for i have given you an example that ye should do as i have done to you 1316 verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him 1317 if ye know these things happy are ye if ye do them 1318 i speak not of you all i know whom i have chosen but that the scripture may be fulfilled he that eateth bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me 1319 now i tell you before it come that when it is come to pass ye may believe that i am he 1320 verily verily i say unto you he that receiveth whomsoever i send receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me 1321 when jesus had thus said he was troubled in spirit and testified and said verily verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me 1322 then the disciples looked one on another doubting of whom he spake 1323 now there was leaning on jesus bosom one of his disciples whom jesus loved 1324 simon peter therefore beckoned to him that he should ask who it should be of whom he spake 1325 he then lying on jesus breast saith unto him lord who is it 1326 jesus answered he it is to whom i shall give a sop when i have dipped it and when he had dipped the sop he gave it to judas iscariot the son of simon 1327 and after the sop satan entered into him then said jesus unto him that thou doest do quickly 1328 now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this unto him 1329 for some of them thought because judas had the bag that jesus had said unto him buy those things that we have need of against the feast or that he should give something to the poor 1330 he then having received the sop went immediately out and it was night 1331 therefore when he was gone out jesus said now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him 1332 if god be glorified in him god shall also glorify him in himself and shall straightway glorify him 1333 little children yet a little while i am with you ye shall seek me and as i said unto the jews whither i go ye cannot come so now i say to you 1334 a new commandment i give unto you that ye love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another 1335 by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if ye have love one to another 1336 simon peter said unto him lord whither goest thou jesus answered him whither i go thou canst not follow me now but thou shalt follow me afterwards 1337 peter said unto him lord why cannot i follow thee now i will lay down my life for thy sake 1338 jesus answered him wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake verily verily i say unto thee the cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice 141 let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also in me 142 in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you 143 and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also 144 and whither i go ye know and the way ye know 145 thomas saith unto him lord we know not whither thou goest and how can we know the way 146 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me 147 if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him 148 philip saith unto him lord shew us the father and it sufficeth us 149 jesus saith unto him have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then shew us the father 1410 believest thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works 1411 believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake 1412 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father 1413 and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son 1414 if ye shall ask any thing in my name i will do it 1415 if ye love me keep my commandments 1416 and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever 1417 even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you 1418 i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you 1419 yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me because i live ye shall live also 1420 at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye in me and i in you 1421 he that hath my commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and i will love him and will manifest myself to him 1422 judas saith unto him not iscariot lord how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world 1423 jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him 1424 he that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings and the word which ye hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me 1425 these things have i spoken unto you being yet present with you 1426 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you 1427 peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid 1428 ye have heard how i said unto you i go away and come again unto you if ye loved me ye would rejoice because i said i go unto the father for my father is greater than i 1429 and now i have told you before it come to pass that when it is come to pass ye might believe 1430 hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me 1431 but that the world may know that i love the father and as the father gave me commandment even so i do arise let us go hence 151 i am the true vine and my father is the husbandman 152 every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit 153 now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you 154 abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me 155 i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing 156 if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned 157 if ye abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you 158 herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples 159 as the father hath loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love 1510 if ye keep my commandments ye shall abide in my love even as i have kept my fathers commandments and abide in his love 1511 these things have i spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full 1512 this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you 1513 greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends 1514 ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever i command you 1515 henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you 1516 ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you 1517 these things i command you that ye love one another 1518 if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you 1519 if ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you 1520 remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also 1521 but all these things will they do unto you for my names sake because they know not him that sent me 1522 if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin 1523 he that hateth me hateth my father also 1524 if i had not done among them the works which none other man did they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father 1525 but this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law they hated me without a cause 1526 but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me 1527 and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning 161 these things have i spoken unto you that ye should not be offended 162 they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth god service 163 and these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me 164 but these things have i told you that when the time shall come ye may remember that i told you of them and these things i said not unto you at the beginning because i was with you 165 but now i go my way to him that sent me and none of you asketh me whither goest thou 166 but because i have said these things unto you sorrow hath filled your heart 167 nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you 168 and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment 169 of sin because they believe not on me 1610 of righteousness because i go to my father and ye see me no more 1611 of judgment because the prince of this world is judged 1612 i have yet many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now 1613 howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will shew you things to come 1614 he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall shew it unto you 1615 all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall shew it unto you 1616 a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me because i go to the father 1617 then said some of his disciples among themselves what is this that he saith unto us a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me and because i go to the father 1618 they said therefore what is this that he saith a little while we cannot tell what he saith 1619 now jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them do ye enquire among yourselves of that i said a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and ye shall see me 1620 verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament but the world shall rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy 1621 a woman when she is in travail hath sorrow because her hour is come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembereth no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world 1622 and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you 1623 and in that day ye shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall ask the father in my name he will give it you 1624 hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name ask and ye shall receive that your joy may be full 1625 these things have i spoken unto you in proverbs but the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall shew you plainly of the father 1626 at that day ye shall ask in my name and i say not unto you that i will pray the father for you 1627 for the father himself loveth you because ye have loved me and have believed that i came out from god 1628 i came forth from the father and am come into the world again i leave the world and go to the father 1629 his disciples said unto him lo now speakest thou plainly and speakest no proverb 1630 now are we sure that thou knowest all things and needest not that any man should ask thee by this we believe that thou camest forth from god 1631 jesus answered them do ye now believe 1632 behold the hour cometh yea is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone and yet i am not alone because the father is with me 1633 these things i have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world 171 these words spake jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son also may glorify thee 172 as thou hast given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him 173 and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent 174 i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do 175 and now o father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which i had with thee before the world was 176 i have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept thy word 177 now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee 178 for i have given unto them the words which thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely that i came out from thee and they have believed that thou didst send me 179 i pray for them i pray not for the world but for them which thou hast given me for they are thine 1710 and all mine are thine and thine are mine and i am glorified in them 1711 and now i am no more in the world but these are in the world and i come to thee holy father keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are 1712 while i was with them in the world i kept them in thy name those that thou gavest me i have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled 1713 and now come i to thee and these things i speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves 1714 i have given them thy word and the world hath hated them because they are not of the world even as i am not of the world 1715 i pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil 1716 they are not of the world even as i am not of the world 1717 sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth 1718 as thou hast sent me into the world even so have i also sent them into the world 1719 and for their sakes i sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth 1720 neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word 1721 that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me 1722 and the glory which thou gavest me i have given them that they may be one even as we are one 1723 i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me 1724 father i will that they also whom thou hast given me be with me where i am that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world 1725 o righteous father the world hath not known thee but i have known thee and these have known that thou hast sent me 1726 and i have declared unto them thy name and will declare it that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them and i in them 181 when jesus had spoken these words he went forth with his disciples over the brook cedron where was a garden into the which he entered and his disciples 182 and judas also which betrayed him knew the place for jesus ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples 183 judas then having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and pharisees cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons 184 jesus therefore knowing all things that should come upon him went forth and said unto them whom seek ye 185 they answered him jesus of nazareth jesus saith unto them i am he and judas also which betrayed him stood with them 186 as soon then as he had said unto them i am he they went backward and fell to the ground 187 then asked he them again whom seek ye and they said jesus of nazareth 188 jesus answered i have told you that i am he if therefore ye seek me let these go their way 189 that the saying might be fulfilled which he spake of them which thou gavest me have i lost none 1810 then simon peter having a sword drew it and smote the high priests servant and cut off his right ear the servants name was malchus 1811 then said jesus unto peter put up thy sword into the sheath the cup which my father hath given me shall i not drink it 1812 then the band and the captain and officers of the jews took jesus and bound him 1813 and led him away to annas first for he was father in law to caiaphas which was the high priest that same year 1814 now caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people 1815 and simon peter followed jesus and so did another disciple that disciple was known unto the high priest and went in with jesus into the palace of the high priest 1816 but peter stood at the door without then went out that other disciple which was known unto the high priest and spake unto her that kept the door and brought in peter 1817 then saith the damsel that kept the door unto peter art not thou also one of this mans disciples he saith i am not 1818 and the servants and officers stood there who had made a fire of coals for it was cold and they warmed themselves and peter stood with them and warmed himself 1819 the high priest then asked jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine 1820 jesus answered him i spake openly to the world i ever taught in the synagogue and in the temple whither the jews always resort and in secret have i said nothing 1821 why askest thou me ask them which heard me what i have said unto them behold they know what i said 1822 and when he had thus spoken one of the officers which stood by struck jesus with the palm of his hand saying answerest thou the high priest so 1823 jesus answered him if i have spoken evil bear witness of the evil but if well why smitest thou me 1824 now annas had sent him bound unto caiaphas the high priest 1825 and simon peter stood and warmed himself they said therefore unto him art not thou also one of his disciples he denied it and said i am not 1826 one of the servants of the high priest being his kinsman whose ear peter cut off saith did not i see thee in the garden with him 1827 peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew 1828 then led they jesus from caiaphas unto the hall of judgment and it was early and they themselves went not into the judgment hall lest they should be defiled but that they might eat the passover 1829 pilate then went out unto them and said what accusation bring ye against this man 1830 they answered and said unto him if he were not a malefactor we would not have delivered him up unto thee 1831 then said pilate unto them take ye him and judge him according to your law the jews therefore said unto him it is not lawful for us to put any man to death 1832 that the saying of jesus might be fulfilled which he spake signifying what death he should die 1833 then pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the jews 1834 jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me 1835 pilate answered am i a jew thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me what hast thou done 1836 jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that i should not be delivered to the jews but now is my kingdom not from hence 1837 pilate therefore said unto him art thou a king then jesus answered thou sayest that i am a king to this end was i born and for this cause came i into the world that i should bear witness unto the truth every one that is of the truth heareth my voice 1838 pilate saith unto him what is truth and when he had said this he went out again unto the jews and saith unto them i find in him no fault at all 1839 but ye have a custom that i should release unto you one at the passover will ye therefore that i release unto you the king of the jews 1840 then cried they all again saying not this man but barabbas now barabbas was a robber 191 then pilate therefore took jesus and scourged him 192 and the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head and they put on him a purple robe 193 and said hail king of the jews and they smote him with their hands 194 pilate therefore went forth again and saith unto them behold i bring him forth to you that ye may know that i find no fault in him 195 then came jesus forth wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe and pilate saith unto them behold the man 196 when the chief priests therefore and officers saw him they cried out saying crucify him crucify him pilate saith unto them take ye him and crucify him for i find no fault in him 197 the jews answered him we have a law and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the son of god 198 when pilate therefore heard that saying he was the more afraid 199 and went again into the judgment hall and saith unto jesus whence art thou but jesus gave him no answer 1910 then saith pilate unto him speakest thou not unto me knowest thou not that i have power to crucify thee and have power to release thee 1911 jesus answered thou couldest have no power at all against me except it were given thee from above therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin 1912 and from thenceforth pilate sought to release him but the jews cried out saying if thou let this man go thou art not caesars friend whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against caesar 1913 when pilate therefore heard that saying he brought jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the pavement but in the hebrew gabbatha 1914 and it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour and he saith unto the jews behold your king 1915 but they cried out away with him away with him crucify him pilate saith unto them shall i crucify your king the chief priests answered we have no king but caesar 1916 then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified and they took jesus and led him away 1917 and he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull which is called in the hebrew golgotha 1918 where they crucified him and two other with him on either side one and jesus in the midst 1919 and pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross and the writing was jesus of nazareth the king of the jews 1920 this title then read many of the jews for the place where jesus was crucified was nigh to the city and it was written in hebrew and greek and latin 1921 then said the chief priests of the jews to pilate write not the king of the jews but that he said i am king of the jews 1922 pilate answered what i have written i have written 1923 then the soldiers when they had crucified jesus took his garments and made four parts to every soldier a part and also his coat now the coat was without seam woven from the top throughout 1924 they said therefore among themselves let us not rend it but cast lots for it whose it shall be that the scripture might be fulfilled which saith they parted my raiment among them and for my vesture they did cast lots these things therefore the soldiers did 1925 now there stood by the cross of jesus his mother and his mothers sister mary the wife of cleophas and mary magdalene 1926 when jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by whom he loved he saith unto his mother woman behold thy son 1927 then saith he to the disciple behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home 1928 after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith i thirst 1929 now there was set a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a spunge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth 1930 when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost 1931 the jews therefore because it was the preparation that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day for that sabbath day was an high day besought pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away 1932 then came the soldiers and brake the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him 1933 but when they came to jesus and saw that he was dead already they brake not his legs 1934 but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water 1935 and he that saw it bare record and his record is true and he knoweth that he saith true that ye might believe 1936 for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him shall not be broken 1937 and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whom they pierced 1938 and after this joseph of arimathaea being a disciple of jesus but secretly for fear of the jews besought pilate that he might take away the body of jesus and pilate gave him leave he came therefore and took the body of jesus 1939 and there came also nicodemus which at the first came to jesus by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about an hundred pound weight 1940 then took they the body of jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices as the manner of the jews is to bury 1941 now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new sepulchre wherein was never man yet laid 1942 there laid they jesus therefore because of the jews preparation day for the sepulchre was nigh at hand 201 the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre 202 then she runneth and cometh to simon peter and to the other disciple whom jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the lord out of the sepulchre and we know not where they have laid him 203 peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the sepulchre 204 so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun peter and came first to the sepulchre 205 and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in 206 then cometh simon peter following him and went into the sepulchre and seeth the linen clothes lie 207 and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself 208 then went in also that other disciple which came first to the sepulchre and he saw and believed 209 for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must rise again from the dead 2010 then the disciples went away again unto their own home 2011 but mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre 2012 and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain 2013 and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my lord and i know not where they have laid him 2014 and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw jesus standing and knew not that it was jesus 2015 jesus saith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou have borne him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and i will take him away 2016 jesus saith unto her mary she turned herself and saith unto him rabboni which is to say master 2017 jesus saith unto her touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father but go to my brethren and say unto them i ascend unto my father and your father and to my god and your god 2018 mary magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the lord and that he had spoken these things unto her 2019 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you 2020 and when he had so said he shewed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the lord 2021 then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send i you 2022 and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the holy ghost 2023 whose soever sins ye remit they are remitted unto them and whose soever sins ye retain they are retained 2024 but thomas one of the twelve called didymus was not with them when jesus came 2025 the other disciples therefore said unto him we have seen the lord but he said unto them except i shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side i will not believe 2026 and after eight days again his disciples were within and thomas with them then came jesus the doors being shut and stood in the midst and said peace be unto you 2027 then saith he to thomas reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing 2028 and thomas answered and said unto him my lord and my god 2029 jesus saith unto him thomas because thou hast seen me thou hast believed blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed 2030 and many other signs truly did jesus in the presence of his disciples which are not written in this book 2031 but these are written that ye might believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that believing ye might have life through his name 211 after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias and on this wise shewed he himself 212 there were together simon peter and thomas called didymus and nathanael of cana in galilee and the sons of zebedee and two other of his disciples 213 simon peter saith unto them i go a fishing they say unto him we also go with thee they went forth and entered into a ship immediately and that night they caught nothing 214 but when the morning was now come jesus stood on the shore but the disciples knew not that it was jesus 215 then jesus saith unto them children have ye any meat they answered him no 216 and he said unto them cast the net on the right side of the ship and ye shall find they cast therefore and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes 217 therefore that disciple whom jesus loved saith unto peter it is the lord now when simon peter heard that it was the lord he girt his fishers coat unto him for he was naked and did cast himself into the sea 218 and the other disciples came in a little ship for they were not far from land but as it were two hundred cubits dragging the net with fishes 219 as soon then as they were come to land they saw a fire of coals there and fish laid thereon and bread 2110 jesus saith unto them bring of the fish which ye have now caught 2111 simon peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes an hundred and fifty and three and for all there were so many yet was not the net broken 2112 jesus saith unto them come and dine and none of the disciples durst ask him who art thou knowing that it was the lord 2113 jesus then cometh and taketh bread and giveth them and fish likewise 2114 this is now the third time that jesus shewed himself to his disciples after that he was risen from the dead 2115 so when they had dined jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas lovest thou me more than these he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my lambs 2116 he saith to him again the second time simon son of jonas lovest thou me he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee he saith unto him feed my sheep 2117 he saith unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest thou me peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time lovest thou me and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things thou knowest that i love thee jesus saith unto him feed my sheep 2118 verily verily i say unto thee when thou wast young thou girdest thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not 2119 this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify god and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me 2120 then peter turning about seeth the disciple whom jesus loved following which also leaned on his breast at supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee 2121 peter seeing him saith to jesus lord and what shall this man do 2122 jesus saith unto him if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee follow thou me 2123 then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet jesus said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he tarry till i come what is that to thee 2124 this is the disciple which testifieth of these things and wrote these things and we know that his testimony is true 2125 and there are also many other things which jesus did the which if they should be written every one i suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written amen the acts of the apostles 11 the former treatise have i made o theophilus of all that jesus began both to do and teach 12 until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen 13 to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god 14 and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me 15 for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence 16 when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel 17 and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power 18 but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judaea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth 19 and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight 110 and while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in white apparel 111 which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven 112 then returned they unto jerusalem from the mount called olivet which is from jerusalem a sabbath days journey 113 and when they were come in they went up into an upper room where abode both peter and james and john and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james the son of alphaeus and simon zelotes and judas the brother of james 114 these all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brethren 115 and in those days peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty 116 men and brethren this scripture must needs have been fulfilled which the holy ghost by the mouth of david spake before concerning judas which was guide to them that took jesus 117 for he was numbered with us and had obtained part of this ministry 118 now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity and falling headlong he burst asunder in the midst and all his bowels gushed out 119 and it was known unto all the dwellers at jerusalem insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue aceldama that is to say the field of blood 120 for it is written in the book of psalms let his habitation be desolate and let no man dwell therein and his bishoprick let another take 121 wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the lord jesus went in and out among us 122 beginning from the baptism of john unto that same day that he was taken up from us must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection 123 and they appointed two joseph called barsabas who was surnamed justus and matthias 124 and they prayed and said thou lord which knowest the hearts of all men shew whether of these two thou hast chosen 125 that he may take part of this ministry and apostleship from which judas by transgression fell that he might go to his own place 126 and they gave forth their lots and the lot fell upon matthias and he was numbered with the eleven apostles 21 and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord in one place 22 and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting 23 and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them 24 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance 25 and there were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven 26 now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language 27 and they were all amazed and marvelled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galilaeans 28 and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born 29 parthians and medes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and in judaea and cappadocia in pontus and asia 210 phrygia and pamphylia in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes 211 cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god 212 and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this 213 others mocking said these men are full of new wine 214 but peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of judaea and all ye that dwell at jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words 215 for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day 216 but this is that which was spoken by the prophet joel 217 and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams 218 and on my servants and on my handmaidens i will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy 219 and i will shew wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapour of smoke 220 the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the lord come 221 and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be saved 222 ye men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth a man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know 223 him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of god ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain 224 whom god hath raised up having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holden of it 225 for david speaketh concerning him i foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that i should not be moved 226 therefore did my heart rejoice and my tongue was glad moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope 227 because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell neither wilt thou suffer thine holy one to see corruption 228 thou hast made known to me the ways of life thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance 229 men and brethren let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch david that he is both dead and buried and his sepulchre is with us unto this day 230 therefore being a prophet and knowing that god had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins according to the flesh he would raise up christ to sit on his throne 231 he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of christ that his soul was not left in hell neither his flesh did see corruption 232 this jesus hath god raised up whereof we all are witnesses 233 therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear 234 for david is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand 235 until i make thy foes thy footstool 236 therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made the same jesus whom ye have crucified both lord and christ 237 now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do 238 then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost 239 for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call 240 and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation 241 then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls 242 and they continued stedfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers 243 and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles 244 and all that believed were together and had all things common 245 and sold their possessions and goods and parted them to all men as every man had need 246 and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart 247 praising god and having favour with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved 31 now peter and john went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer being the ninth hour 32 and a certain man lame from his mothers womb was carried whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called beautiful to ask alms of them that entered into the temple 33 who seeing peter and john about to go into the temple asked an alms 34 and peter fastening his eyes upon him with john said look on us 35 and he gave heed unto them expecting to receive something of them 36 then peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have give i thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk 37 and he took him by the right hand and lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength 38 and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with them into the temple walking and leaping and praising god 39 and all the people saw him walking and praising god 310 and they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the beautiful gate of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him 311 and as the lame man which was healed held peter and john all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called solomons greatly wondering 312 and when peter saw it he answered unto the people ye men of israel why marvel ye at this or why look ye so earnestly on us as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk 313 the god of abraham and of isaac and of jacob the god of our fathers hath glorified his son jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go 314 but ye denied the holy one and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you 315 and killed the prince of life whom god hath raised from the dead whereof we are witnesses 316 and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom ye see and know yea the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all 317 and now brethren i wot that through ignorance ye did it as did also your rulers 318 but those things which god before had shewed by the mouth of all his prophets that christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled 319 repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord 320 and he shall send jesus christ which before was preached unto you 321 whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things which god hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began 322 for moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you 323 and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people 324 yea and all the prophets from samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days 325 ye are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which god made with our fathers saying unto abraham and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed 326 unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities 41 and as they spake unto the people the priests and the captain of the temple and the sadducees came upon them 42 being grieved that they taught the people and preached through jesus the resurrection from the dead 43 and they laid hands on them and put them in hold unto the next day for it was now eventide 44 howbeit many of them which heard the word believed and the number of the men was about five thousand 45 and it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and elders and scribes 46 and annas the high priest and caiaphas and john and alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at jerusalem 47 and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have ye done this 48 then peter filled with the holy ghost said unto them ye rulers of the people and elders of israel 49 if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man by what means he is made whole 410 be it known unto you all and to all the people of israel that by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom ye crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him doth this man stand here before you whole 411 this is the stone which was set at nought of you builders which is become the head of the corner 412 neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved 413 now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with jesus 414 and beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it 415 but when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council they conferred among themselves 416 saying what shall we do to these men for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in jerusalem and we cannot deny it 417 but that it spread no further among the people let us straitly threaten them that they speak henceforth to no man in this name 418 and they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of jesus 419 but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye 420 for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard 421 so when they had further threatened them they let them go finding nothing how they might punish them because of the people for all men glorified god for that which was done 422 for the man was above forty years old on whom this miracle of healing was shewed 423 and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them 424 and when they heard that they lifted up their voice to god with one accord and said lord thou art god which hast made heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is 425 who by the mouth of thy servant david hast said why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things 426 the kings of the earth stood up and the rulers were gathered together against the lord and against his christ 427 for of a truth against thy holy child jesus whom thou hast anointed both herod and pontius pilate with the gentiles and the people of israel were gathered together 428 for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done 429 and now lord behold their threatenings and grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word 430 by stretching forth thine hand to heal and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child jesus 431 and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they spake the word of god with boldness 432 and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things common 433 and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all 434 neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold 435 and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need 436 and joses who by the apostles was surnamed barnabas which is being interpreted the son of consolation a levite and of the country of cyprus 437 having land sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet 51 but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold a possession 52 and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet 53 but peter said ananias why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land 54 whiles it remained was it not thine own and after it was sold was it not in thine own power why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart thou hast not lied unto men but unto god 55 and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things 56 and the young men arose wound him up and carried him out and buried him 57 and it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in 58 and peter answered unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for so much and she said yea for so much 59 then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out 510 then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded up the ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carrying her forth buried her by her husband 511 and great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things 512 and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people and they were all with one accord in solomons porch 513 and of the rest durst no man join himself to them but the people magnified them 514 and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both of men and women 515 insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of peter passing by might overshadow some of them 516 there came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed every one 517 then the high priest rose up and all they that were with him which is the sect of the sadducees and were filled with indignation 518 and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison 519 but the angel of the lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said 520 go stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life 521 and when they heard that they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught but the high priest came and they that were with him and called the council together and all the senate of the children of israel and sent to the prison to have them brought 522 but when the officers came and found them not in the prison they returned and told 523 saying the prison truly found we shut with all safety and the keepers standing without before the doors but when we had opened we found no man within 524 now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things they doubted of them whereunto this would grow 525 then came one and told them saying behold the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people 526 then went the captain with the officers and brought them without violence for they feared the people lest they should have been stoned 527 and when they had brought them they set them before the council and the high priest asked them 528 saying did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach in this name and behold ye have filled jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this mans blood upon us 529 then peter and the other apostles answered and said we ought to obey god rather than men 530 the god of our fathers raised up jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree 531 him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a saviour for to give repentance to israel and forgiveness of sins 532 and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god hath given to them that obey him 533 when they heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them 534 then stood there up one in the council a pharisee named gamaliel a doctor of the law had in reputation among all the people and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space 535 and said unto them ye men of israel take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men 536 for before these days rose up theudas boasting himself to be somebody to whom a number of men about four hundred joined themselves who was slain and all as many as obeyed him were scattered and brought to nought 537 after this man rose up judas of galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away much people after him he also perished and all even as many as obeyed him were dispersed 538 and now i say unto you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this work be of men it will come to nought 539 but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow it lest haply ye be found even to fight against god 540 and to him they agreed and when they had called the apostles and beaten them they commanded that they should not speak in the name of jesus and let them go 541 and they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name 542 and daily in the temple and in every house they ceased not to teach and preach jesus christ 61 and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied there arose a murmuring of the grecians against the hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration 62 then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it is not reason that we should leave the word of god and serve tables 63 wherefore brethren look ye out among you seven men of honest report full of the holy ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business 64 but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word 65 and the saying pleased the whole multitude and they chose stephen a man full of faith and of the holy ghost and philip and prochorus and nicanor and timon and parmenas and nicolas a proselyte of antioch 66 whom they set before the apostles and when they had prayed they laid their hands on them 67 and the word of god increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith 68 and stephen full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people 69 then there arose certain of the synagogue which is called the synagogue of the libertines and cyrenians and alexandrians and of them of cilicia and of asia disputing with stephen 610 and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake 611 then they suborned men which said we have heard him speak blasphemous words against moses and against god 612 and they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes and came upon him and caught him and brought him to the council 613 and set up false witnesses which said this man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law 614 for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the customs which moses delivered us 615 and all that sat in the council looking stedfastly on him saw his face as it had been the face of an angel 71 then said the high priest are these things so 72 and he said men brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in charran 73 and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which i shall shew thee 74 then came he out of the land of the chaldaeans and dwelt in charran and from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein ye now dwell 75 and he gave him none inheritance in it no not so much as to set his foot on yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him when as yet he had no child 76 and god spake on this wise that his seed should sojourn in a strange land and that they should bring them into bondage and entreat them evil four hundred years 77 and the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will i judge said god and after that shall they come forth and serve me in this place 78 and he gave him the covenant of circumcision and so abraham begat isaac and circumcised him the eighth day and isaac begat jacob and jacob begat the twelve patriarchs 79 and the patriarchs moved with envy sold joseph into egypt but god was with him 710 and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of pharaoh king of egypt and he made him governor over egypt and all his house 711 now there came a dearth over all the land of egypt and chanaan and great affliction and our fathers found no sustenance 712 but when jacob heard that there was corn in egypt he sent out our fathers first 713 and at the second time joseph was made known to his brethren and josephs kindred was made known unto pharaoh 714 then sent joseph and called his father jacob to him and all his kindred threescore and fifteen souls 715 so jacob went down into egypt and died he and our fathers 716 and were carried over into sychem and laid in the sepulchre that abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of emmor the father of sychem 717 but when the time of the promise drew nigh which god had sworn to abraham the people grew and multiplied in egypt 718 till another king arose which knew not joseph 719 the same dealt subtilly with our kindred and evil entreated our fathers so that they cast out their young children to the end they might not live 720 in which time moses was born and was exceeding fair and nourished up in his fathers house three months 721 and when he was cast out pharaohs daughter took him up and nourished him for her own son 722 and moses was learned in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was mighty in words and in deeds 723 and when he was full forty years old it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of israel 724 and seeing one of them suffer wrong he defended him and avenged him that was oppressed and smote the egyptian 725 for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that god by his hand would deliver them but they understood not 726 and the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove and would have set them at one again saying sirs ye are brethren why do ye wrong one to another 727 but he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away saying who made thee a ruler and a judge over us 728 wilt thou kill me as thou diddest the egyptian yesterday 729 then fled moses at this saying and was a stranger in the land of madian where he begat two sons 730 and when forty years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sina an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in a bush 731 when moses saw it he wondered at the sight and as he drew near to behold it the voice of the lord came unto him 732 saying i am the god of thy fathers the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob then moses trembled and durst not behold 733 then said the lord to him put off thy shoes from thy feet for the place where thou standest is holy ground 734 i have seen i have seen the affliction of my people which is in egypt and i have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them and now come i will send thee into egypt 735 this moses whom they refused saying who made thee a ruler and a judge the same did god send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush 736 he brought them out after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of egypt and in the red sea and in the wilderness forty years 737 this is that moses which said unto the children of israel a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me him shall ye hear 738 this is he that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount sina and with our fathers who received the lively oracles to give unto us 739 to whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turned back again into egypt 740 saying unto aaron make us gods to go before us for as for this moses which brought us out of the land of egypt we wot not what is become of him 741 and they made a calf in those days and offered sacrifice unto the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands 742 then god turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven as it is written in the book of the prophets o ye house of israel have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness 743 yea ye took up the tabernacle of moloch and the star of your god remphan figures which ye made to worship them and i will carry you away beyond babylon 744 our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness as he had appointed speaking unto moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen 745 which also our fathers that came after brought in with jesus into the possession of the gentiles whom god drave out before the face of our fathers unto the days of david 746 who found favour before god and desired to find a tabernacle for the god of jacob 747 but solomon built him an house 748 howbeit the most high dwelleth not in temples made with hands as saith the prophet 749 heaven is my throne and earth is my footstool what house will ye build me saith the lord or what is the place of my rest 750 hath not my hand made all these things 751 ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears ye do always resist the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye 752 which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the just one of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers 753 who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it 754 when they heard these things they were cut to the heart and they gnashed on him with their teeth 755 but he being full of the holy ghost looked up stedfastly into heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing on the right hand of god 756 and said behold i see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of god 757 then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord 758 and cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young mans feet whose name was saul 759 and they stoned stephen calling upon god and saying lord jesus receive my spirit 760 and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep 81 and saul was consenting unto his death and at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of judaea and samaria except the apostles 82 and devout men carried stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him 83 as for saul he made havock of the church entering into every house and haling men and women committed them to prison 84 therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word 85 then philip went down to the city of samaria and preached christ unto them 86 and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did 87 for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that were lame were healed 88 and there was great joy in that city 89 but there was a certain man called simon which beforetime in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one 810 to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of god 811 and to him they had regard because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries 812 but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women 813 then simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philip and wondered beholding the miracles and signs which were done 814 now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they sent unto them peter and john 815 who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost 816 for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus 817 then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost 818 and when simon saw that through laying on of the apostles hands the holy ghost was given he offered them money 819 saying give me also this power that on whomsoever i lay hands he may receive the holy ghost 820 but peter said unto him thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money 821 thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of god 822 repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray god if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee 823 for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity 824 then answered simon and said pray ye to the lord for me that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me 825 and they when they had testified and preached the word of the lord returned to jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages of the samaritans 826 and the angel of the lord spake unto philip saying arise and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from jerusalem unto gaza which is desert 827 and he arose and went and behold a man of ethiopia an eunuch of great authority under candace queen of the ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to jerusalem for to worship 828 was returning and sitting in his chariot read esaias the prophet 829 then the spirit said unto philip go near and join thyself to this chariot 830 and philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet esaias and said understandest thou what thou readest 831 and he said how can i except some man should guide me and he desired philip that he would come up and sit with him 832 the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and like a lamb dumb before his shearer so opened he not his mouth 833 in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation for his life is taken from the earth 834 and the eunuch answered philip and said i pray thee of whom speaketh the prophet this of himself or of some other man 835 then philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him jesus 836 and as they went on their way they came unto a certain water and the eunuch said see here is water what doth hinder me to be baptized 837 and philip said if thou believest with all thine heart thou mayest and he answered and said i believe that jesus christ is the son of god 838 and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him 839 and when they were come up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught away philip that the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing 840 but philip was found at azotus and passing through he preached in all the cities till he came to caesarea 91 and saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the lord went unto the high priest 92 and desired of him letters to damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound unto jerusalem 93 and as he journeyed he came near damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven 94 and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecutest thou me 95 and he said who art thou lord and the lord said i am jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks 96 and he trembling and astonished said lord what wilt thou have me to do and the lord said unto him arise and go into the city and it shall be told thee what thou must do 97 and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man 98 and saul arose from the earth and when his eyes were opened he saw no man but they led him by the hand and brought him into damascus 99 and he was three days without sight and neither did eat nor drink 910 and there was a certain disciple at damascus named ananias and to him said the lord in a vision ananias and he said behold i am here lord 911 and the lord said unto him arise and go into the street which is called straight and enquire in the house of judas for one called saul of tarsus for behold he prayeth 912 and hath seen in a vision a man named ananias coming in and putting his hand on him that he might receive his sight 913 then ananias answered lord i have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy saints at jerusalem 914 and here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name 915 but the lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the gentiles and kings and the children of israel 916 for i will shew him how great things he must suffer for my names sake 917 and ananias went his way and entered into the house and putting his hands on him said brother saul the lord even jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest hath sent me that thou mightest receive thy sight and be filled with the holy ghost 918 and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight forthwith and arose and was baptized 919 and when he had received meat he was strengthened then was saul certain days with the disciples which were at damascus 920 and straightway he preached christ in the synagogues that he is the son of god 921 but all that heard him were amazed and said is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in jerusalem and came hither for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests 922 but saul increased the more in strength and confounded the jews which dwelt at damascus proving that this is very christ 923 and after that many days were fulfilled the jews took counsel to kill him 924 but their laying await was known of saul and they watched the gates day and night to kill him 925 then the disciples took him by night and let him down by the wall in a basket 926 and when saul was come to jerusalem he assayed to join himself to the disciples but they were all afraid of him and believed not that he was a disciple 927 but barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at damascus in the name of jesus 928 and he was with them coming in and going out at jerusalem 929 and he spake boldly in the name of the lord jesus and disputed against the grecians but they went about to slay him 930 which when the brethren knew they brought him down to caesarea and sent him forth to tarsus 931 then had the churches rest throughout all judaea and galilee and samaria and were edified and walking in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy ghost were multiplied 932 and it came to pass as peter passed throughout all quarters he came down also to the saints which dwelt at lydda 933 and there he found a certain man named aeneas which had kept his bed eight years and was sick of the palsy 934 and peter said unto him aeneas jesus christ maketh thee whole arise and make thy bed and he arose immediately 935 and all that dwelt at lydda and saron saw him and turned to the lord 936 now there was at joppa a certain disciple named tabitha which by interpretation is called dorcas this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did 937 and it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died whom when they had washed they laid her in an upper chamber 938 and forasmuch as lydda was nigh to joppa and the disciples had heard that peter was there they sent unto him two men desiring him that he would not delay to come to them 939 then peter arose and went with them when he was come they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by him weeping and shewing the coats and garments which dorcas made while she was with them 940 but peter put them all forth and kneeled down and prayed and turning him to the body said tabitha arise and she opened her eyes and when she saw peter she sat up 941 and he gave her his hand and lifted her up and when he had called the saints and widows presented her alive 942 and it was known throughout all joppa and many believed in the lord 943 and it came to pass that he tarried many days in joppa with one simon a tanner 101 there was a certain man in caesarea called cornelius a centurion of the band called the italian band 102 a devout man and one that feared god with all his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed to god alway 103 he saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of god coming in to him and saying unto him cornelius 104 and when he looked on him he was afraid and said what is it lord and he said unto him thy prayers and thine alms are come up for a memorial before god 105 and now send men to joppa and call for one simon whose surname is peter 106 he lodgeth with one simon a tanner whose house is by the sea side he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do 107 and when the angel which spake unto cornelius was departed he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually 108 and when he had declared all these things unto them he sent them to joppa 109 on the morrow as they went on their journey and drew nigh unto the city peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour 1010 and he became very hungry and would have eaten but while they made ready he fell into a trance 1011 and saw heaven opened and a certain vessel descending upon him as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners and let down to the earth 1012 wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air 1013 and there came a voice to him rise peter kill and eat 1014 but peter said not so lord for i have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean 1015 and the voice spake unto him again the second time what god hath cleansed that call not thou common 1016 this was done thrice and the vessel was received up again into heaven 1017 now while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean behold the men which were sent from cornelius had made enquiry for simons house and stood before the gate 1018 and called and asked whether simon which was surnamed peter were lodged there 1019 while peter thought on the vision the spirit said unto him behold three men seek thee 1020 arise therefore and get thee down and go with them doubting nothing for i have sent them 1021 then peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from cornelius and said behold i am he whom ye seek what is the cause wherefore ye are come 1022 and they said cornelius the centurion a just man and one that feareth god and of good report among all the nation of the jews was warned from god by an holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of thee 1023 then called he them in and lodged them and on the morrow peter went away with them and certain brethren from joppa accompanied him 1024 and the morrow after they entered into caesarea and cornelius waited for them and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends 1025 and as peter was coming in cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him 1026 but peter took him up saying stand up i myself also am a man 1027 and as he talked with him he went in and found many that were come together 1028 and he said unto them ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a jew to keep company or come unto one of another nation but god hath shewed me that i should not call any man common or unclean 1029 therefore came i unto you without gainsaying as soon as i was sent for i ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me 1030 and cornelius said four days ago i was fasting until this hour and at the ninth hour i prayed in my house and behold a man stood before me in bright clothing 1031 and said cornelius thy prayer is heard and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of god 1032 send therefore to joppa and call hither simon whose surname is peter he is lodged in the house of one simon a tanner by the sea side who when he cometh shall speak unto thee 1033 immediately therefore i sent to thee and thou hast well done that thou art come now therefore are we all here present before god to hear all things that are commanded thee of god 1034 then peter opened his mouth and said of a truth i perceive that god is no respecter of persons 1035 but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him 1036 the word which god sent unto the children of israel preaching peace by jesus christ he is lord of all 1037 that word i say ye know which was published throughout all judaea and began from galilee after the baptism which john preached 1038 how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy ghost and with power who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil for god was with him 1039 and we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the jews and in jerusalem whom they slew and hanged on a tree 1040 him god raised up the third day and shewed him openly 1041 not to all the people but unto witnesses chosen before god even to us who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead 1042 and he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he which was ordained of god to be the judge of quick and dead 1043 to him give all the prophets witness that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins 1044 while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on all them which heard the word 1045 and they of the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as came with peter because that on the gentiles also was poured out the gift of the holy ghost 1046 for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god then answered peter 1047 can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the holy ghost as well as we 1048 and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the lord then prayed they him to tarry certain days 111 and the apostles and brethren that were in judaea heard that the gentiles had also received the word of god 112 and when peter was come up to jerusalem they that were of the circumcision contended with him 113 saying thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and didst eat with them 114 but peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded it by order unto them saying 115 i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision a certain vessel descend as it had been a great sheet let down from heaven by four corners and it came even to me 116 upon the which when i had fastened mine eyes i considered and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and creeping things and fowls of the air 117 and i heard a voice saying unto me arise peter slay and eat 118 but i said not so lord for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth 119 but the voice answered me again from heaven what god hath cleansed that call not thou common 1110 and this was done three times and all were drawn up again into heaven 1111 and behold immediately there were three men already come unto the house where i was sent from caesarea unto me 1112 and the spirit bade me go with them nothing doubting moreover these six brethren accompanied me and we entered into the mans house 1113 and he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house which stood and said unto him send men to joppa and call for simon whose surname is peter 1114 who shall tell thee words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved 1115 and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning 1116 then remembered i the word of the lord how that he said john indeed baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost 1117 forasmuch then as god gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed on the lord jesus christ what was i that i could withstand god 1118 when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god saying then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life 1119 now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about stephen travelled as far as phenice and cyprus and antioch preaching the word to none but unto the jews only 1120 and some of them were men of cyprus and cyrene which when they were come to antioch spake unto the grecians preaching the lord jesus 1121 and the hand of the lord was with them and a great number believed and turned unto the lord 1122 then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in jerusalem and they sent forth barnabas that he should go as far as antioch 1123 who when he came and had seen the grace of god was glad and exhorted them all that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the lord 1124 for he was a good man and full of the holy ghost and of faith and much people was added unto the lord 1125 then departed barnabas to tarsus for to seek saul 1126 and when he had found him he brought him unto antioch and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called christians first in antioch 1127 and in these days came prophets from jerusalem unto antioch 1128 and there stood up one of them named agabus and signified by the spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world which came to pass in the days of claudius caesar 1129 then the disciples every man according to his ability determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in judaea 1130 which also they did and sent it to the elders by the hands of barnabas and saul 121 now about that time herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church 122 and he killed james the brother of john with the sword 123 and because he saw it pleased the jews he proceeded further to take peter also then were the days of unleavened bread 124 and when he had apprehended him he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him intending after easter to bring him forth to the people 125 peter therefore was kept in prison but prayer was made without ceasing of the church unto god for him 126 and when herod would have brought him forth the same night peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and the keepers before the door kept the prison 127 and behold the angel of the lord came upon him and a light shined in the prison and he smote peter on the side and raised him up saying arise up quickly and his chains fell off from his hands 128 and the angel said unto him gird thyself and bind on thy sandals and so he did and he saith unto him cast thy garment about thee and follow me 129 and he went out and followed him and wist not that it was true which was done by the angel but thought he saw a vision 1210 when they were past the first and the second ward they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city which opened to them of his own accord and they went out and passed on through one street and forthwith the angel departed from him 1211 and when peter was come to himself he said now i know of a surety that the lord hath sent his angel and hath delivered me out of the hand of herod and from all the expectation of the people of the jews 1212 and when he had considered the thing he came to the house of mary the mother of john whose surname was mark where many were gathered together praying 1213 and as peter knocked at the door of the gate a damsel came to hearken named rhoda 1214 and when she knew peters voice she opened not the gate for gladness but ran in and told how peter stood before the gate 1215 and they said unto her thou art mad but she constantly affirmed that it was even so then said they it is his angel 1216 but peter continued knocking and when they had opened the door and saw him they were astonished 1217 but he beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace declared unto them how the lord had brought him out of the prison and he said go shew these things unto james and to the brethren and he departed and went into another place 1218 now as soon as it was day there was no small stir among the soldiers what was become of peter 1219 and when herod had sought for him and found him not he examined the keepers and commanded that they should be put to death and he went down from judaea to caesarea and there abode 1220 and herod was highly displeased with them of tyre and sidon but they came with one accord to him and having made blastus the kings chamberlain their friend desired peace because their country was nourished by the kings country 1221 and upon a set day herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them 1222 and the people gave a shout saying it is the voice of a god and not of a man 1223 and immediately the angel of the lord smote him because he gave not god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost 1224 but the word of god grew and multiplied 1225 and barnabas and saul returned from jerusalem when they had fulfilled their ministry and took with them john whose surname was mark 131 now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teachers as barnabas and simeon that was called niger and lucius of cyrene and manaen which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch and saul 132 as they ministered to the lord and fasted the holy ghost said separate me barnabas and saul for the work whereunto i have called them 133 and when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they sent them away 134 so they being sent forth by the holy ghost departed unto seleucia and from thence they sailed to cyprus 135 and when they were at salamis they preached the word of god in the synagogues of the jews and they had also john to their minister 136 and when they had gone through the isle unto paphos they found a certain sorcerer a false prophet a jew whose name was barjesus 137 which was with the deputy of the country sergius paulus a prudent man who called for barnabas and saul and desired to hear the word of god 138 but elymas the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith 139 then saul who also is called paul filled with the holy ghost set his eyes on him 1310 and said o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord 1311 and now behold the hand of the lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the sun for a season and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand 1312 then the deputy when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the doctrine of the lord 1313 now when paul and his company loosed from paphos they came to perga in pamphylia and john departing from them returned to jerusalem 1314 but when they departed from perga they came to antioch in pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down 1315 and after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them saying ye men and brethren if ye have any word of exhortation for the people say on 1316 then paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said men of israel and ye that fear god give audience 1317 the god of this people of israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of egypt and with an high arm brought he them out of it 1318 and about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in the wilderness 1319 and when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of chanaan he divided their land to them by lot 1320 and after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years until samuel the prophet 1321 and afterward they desired a king and god gave unto them saul the son of cis a man of the tribe of benjamin by the space of forty years 1322 and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to be their king to whom also he gave their testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfil all my will 1323 of this mans seed hath god according to his promise raised unto israel a saviour jesus 1324 when john had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of israel 1325 and as john fulfilled his course he said whom think ye that i am i am not he but behold there cometh one after me whose shoes of his feet i am not worthy to loose 1326 men and brethren children of the stock of abraham and whosoever among you feareth god to you is the word of this salvation sent 1327 for they that dwell at jerusalem and their rulers because they knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day they have fulfilled them in condemning him 1328 and though they found no cause of death in him yet desired they pilate that he should be slain 1329 and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a sepulchre 1330 but god raised him from the dead 1331 and he was seen many days of them which came up with him from galilee to jerusalem who are his witnesses unto the people 1332 and we declare unto you glad tidings how that the promise which was made unto the fathers 1333 god hath fulfilled the same unto us their children in that he hath raised up jesus again as it is also written in the second psalm thou art my son this day have i begotten thee 1334 and as concerning that he raised him up from the dead now no more to return to corruption he said on this wise i will give you the sure mercies of david 1335 wherefore he saith also in another psalm thou shalt not suffer thine holy one to see corruption 1336 for david after he had served his own generation by the will of god fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption 1337 but he whom god raised again saw no corruption 1338 be it known unto you therefore men and brethren that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins 1339 and by him all that believe are justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the law of moses 1340 beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the prophets 1341 behold ye despisers and wonder and perish for i work a work in your days a work which ye shall in no wise believe though a man declare it unto you 1342 and when the jews were gone out of the synagogue the gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath 1343 now when the congregation was broken up many of the jews and religious proselytes followed paul and barnabas who speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of god 1344 and the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of god 1345 but when the jews saw the multitudes they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by paul contradicting and blaspheming 1346 then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles 1347 for so hath the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the earth 1348 and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed 1349 and the word of the lord was published throughout all the region 1350 but the jews stirred up the devout and honourable women and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against paul and barnabas and expelled them out of their coasts 1351 but they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came unto iconium 1352 and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy ghost 141 and it came to pass in iconium that they went both together into the synagogue of the jews and so spake that a great multitude both of the jews and also of the greeks believed 142 but the unbelieving jews stirred up the gentiles and made their minds evil affected against the brethren 143 long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the lord which gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands 144 but the multitude of the city was divided and part held with the jews and part with the apostles 145 and when there was an assault made both of the gentiles and also of the jews with their rulers to use them despitefully and to stone them 146 they were ware of it and fled unto lystra and derbe cities of lycaonia and unto the region that lieth round about 147 and there they preached the gospel 148 and there sat a certain man at lystra impotent in his feet being a cripple from his mothers womb who never had walked 149 the same heard paul speak who stedfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed 1410 said with a loud voice stand upright on thy feet and he leaped and walked 1411 and when the people saw what paul had done they lifted up their voices saying in the speech of lycaonia the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men 1412 and they called barnabas jupiter and paul mercurius because he was the chief speaker 1413 then the priest of jupiter which was before their city brought oxen and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice with the people 1414 which when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of they rent their clothes and ran in among the people crying out 1415 and saying sirs why do ye these things we also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living god which made heaven and earth and the sea and all things that are therein 1416 who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways 1417 nevertheless he left not himself without witness in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons filling our hearts with food and gladness 1418 and with these sayings scarce restrained they the people that they had not done sacrifice unto them 1419 and there came thither certain jews from antioch and iconium who persuaded the people and having stoned paul drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead 1420 howbeit as the disciples stood round about him he rose up and came into the city and the next day he departed with barnabas to derbe 1421 and when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many they returned again to lystra and to iconium and antioch 1422 confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of god 1423 and when they had ordained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the lord on whom they believed 1424 and after they had passed throughout pisidia they came to pamphylia 1425 and when they had preached the word in perga they went down into attalia 1426 and thence sailed to antioch from whence they had been recommended to the grace of god for the work which they fulfilled 1427 and when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that god had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles 1428 and there they abode long time with the disciples 151 and certain men which came down from judaea taught the brethren and said except ye be circumcised after the manner of moses ye cannot be saved 152 when therefore paul and barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them they determined that paul and barnabas and certain other of them should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question 153 and being brought on their way by the church they passed through phenice and samaria declaring the conversion of the gentiles and they caused great joy unto all the brethren 154 and when they were come to jerusalem they were received of the church and of the apostles and elders and they declared all things that god had done with them 155 but there rose up certain of the sect of the pharisees which believed saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of moses 156 and the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter 157 and when there had been much disputing peter rose up and said unto them men and brethren ye know how that a good while ago god made choice among us that the gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe 158 and god which knoweth the hearts bare them witness giving them the holy ghost even as he did unto us 159 and put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith 1510 now therefore why tempt ye god to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear 1511 but we believe that through the grace of the lord jesus christ we shall be saved even as they 1512 then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to barnabas and paul declaring what miracles and wonders god had wrought among the gentiles by them 1513 and after they had held their peace james answered saying men and brethren hearken unto me 1514 simeon hath declared how god at the first did visit the gentiles to take out of them a people for his name 1515 and to this agree the words of the prophets as it is written 1516 after this i will return and will build again the tabernacle of david which is fallen down and i will build again the ruins thereof and i will set it up 1517 that the residue of men might seek after the lord and all the gentiles upon whom my name is called saith the lord who doeth all these things 1518 known unto god are all his works from the beginning of the world 1519 wherefore my sentence is that we trouble not them which from among the gentiles are turned to god 1520 but that we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled and from blood 1521 for moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him being read in the synagogues every sabbath day 1522 then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church to send chosen men of their own company to antioch with paul and barnabas namely judas surnamed barsabas and silas chief men among the brethren 1523 and they wrote letters by them after this manner the apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in antioch and syria and cilicia 1524 forasmuch as we have heard that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words subverting your souls saying ye must be circumcised and keep the law to whom we gave no such commandment 1525 it seemed good unto us being assembled with one accord to send chosen men unto you with our beloved barnabas and paul 1526 men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ 1527 we have sent therefore judas and silas who shall also tell you the same things by mouth 1528 for it seemed good to the holy ghost and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things 1529 that ye abstain from meats offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication from which if ye keep yourselves ye shall do well fare ye well 1530 so when they were dismissed they came to antioch and when they had gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle 1531 which when they had read they rejoiced for the consolation 1532 and judas and silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed them 1533 and after they had tarried there a space they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles 1534 notwithstanding it pleased silas to abide there still 1535 paul also and barnabas continued in antioch teaching and preaching the word of the lord with many others also 1536 and some days after paul said unto barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the lord and see how they do 1537 and barnabas determined to take with them john whose surname was mark 1538 but paul thought not good to take him with them who departed from them from pamphylia and went not with them to the work 1539 and the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other and so barnabas took mark and sailed unto cyprus 1540 and paul chose silas and departed being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of god 1541 and he went through syria and cilicia confirming the churches 161 then came he to derbe and lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a jewess and believed but his father was a greek 162 which was well reported of by the brethren that were at lystra and iconium 163 him would paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a greek 164 and as they went through the cities they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at jerusalem 165 and so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number daily 166 now when they had gone throughout phrygia and the region of galatia and were forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia 167 after they were come to mysia they assayed to go into bithynia but the spirit suffered them not 168 and they passing by mysia came down to troas 169 and a vision appeared to paul in the night there stood a man of macedonia and prayed him saying come over into macedonia and help us 1610 and after he had seen the vision immediately we endeavoured to go into macedonia assuredly gathering that the lord had called us for to preach the gospel unto them 1611 therefore loosing from troas we came with a straight course to samothracia and the next day to neapolis 1612 and from thence to philippi which is the chief city of that part of macedonia and a colony and we were in that city abiding certain days 1613 and on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side where prayer was wont to be made and we sat down and spake unto the women which resorted thither 1614 and a certain woman named lydia a seller of purple of the city of thyatira which worshipped god heard us whose heart the lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken of paul 1615 and when she was baptized and her household she besought us saying if ye have judged me to be faithful to the lord come into my house and abide there and she constrained us 1616 and it came to pass as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying 1617 the same followed paul and us and cried saying these men are the servants of the most high god which shew unto us the way of salvation 1618 and this did she many days but paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit i command thee in the name of jesus christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour 1619 and when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone they caught paul and silas and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers 1620 and brought them to the magistrates saying these men being jews do exceedingly trouble our city 1621 and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being romans 1622 and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them 1623 and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the jailor to keep them safely 1624 who having received such a charge thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks 1625 and at midnight paul and silas prayed and sang praises unto god and the prisoners heard them 1626 and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and every ones bands were loosed 1627 and the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled 1628 but paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here 1629 then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before paul and silas 1630 and brought them out and said sirs what must i do to be saved 1631 and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house 1632 and they spake unto him the word of the lord and to all that were in his house 1633 and he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straightway 1634 and when he had brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in god with all his house 1635 and when it was day the magistrates sent the serjeants saying let those men go 1636 and the keeper of the prison told this saying to paul the magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace 1637 but paul said unto them they have beaten us openly uncondemned being romans and have cast us into prison and now do they thrust us out privily nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch us out 1638 and the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates and they feared when they heard that they were romans 1639 and they came and besought them and brought them out and desired them to depart out of the city 1640 and they went out of the prison and entered into the house of lydia and when they had seen the brethren they comforted them and departed 171 now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia they came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the jews 172 and paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures 173 opening and alleging that christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this jesus whom i preach unto you is christ 174 and some of them believed and consorted with paul and silas and of the devout greeks a great multitude and of the chief women not a few 175 but the jews which believed not moved with envy took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of jason and sought to bring them out to the people 176 and when they found them not they drew jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city crying these that have turned the world upside down are come hither also 177 whom jason hath received and these all do contrary to the decrees of caesar saying that there is another king one jesus 178 and they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things 179 and when they had taken security of jason and of the other they let them go 1710 and the brethren immediately sent away paul and silas by night unto berea who coming thither went into the synagogue of the jews 1711 these were more noble than those in thessalonica in that they received the word with all readiness of mind and searched the scriptures daily whether those things were so 1712 therefore many of them believed also of honourable women which were greeks and of men not a few 1713 but when the jews of thessalonica had knowledge that the word of god was preached of paul at berea they came thither also and stirred up the people 1714 and then immediately the brethren sent away paul to go as it were to the sea but silas and timotheus abode there still 1715 and they that conducted paul brought him unto athens and receiving a commandment unto silas and timotheus for to come to him with all speed they departed 1716 now while paul waited for them at athens his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry 1717 therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the jews and with the devout persons and in the market daily with them that met with him 1718 then certain philosophers of the epicureans and of the stoicks encountered him and some said what will this babbler say other some he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods because he preached unto them jesus and the resurrection 1719 and they took him and brought him unto areopagus saying may we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is 1720 for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things mean 1721 for all the athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing 1722 then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and said ye men of athens i perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious 1723 for as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god whom therefore ye ignorantly worship him declare i unto you 1724 god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands 1725 neither is worshipped with mens hands as though he needed any thing seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things 1726 and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation 1727 that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us 1728 for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring 1729 forasmuch then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and mans device 1730 and the times of this ignorance god winked at but now commandeth all men every where to repent 1731 because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead 1732 and when they heard of the resurrection of the dead some mocked and others said we will hear thee again of this matter 1733 so paul departed from among them 1734 howbeit certain men clave unto him and believed among the which was dionysius the areopagite and a woman named damaris and others with them 181 after these things paul departed from athens and came to corinth 182 and found a certain jew named aquila born in pontus lately come from italy with his wife priscilla because that claudius had commanded all jews to depart from rome and came unto them 183 and because he was of the same craft he abode with them and wrought for by their occupation they were tentmakers 184 and he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded the jews and the greeks 185 and when silas and timotheus were come from macedonia paul was pressed in the spirit and testified to the jews that jesus was christ 186 and when they opposed themselves and blasphemed he shook his raiment and said unto them your blood be upon your own heads i am clean from henceforth i will go unto the gentiles 187 and he departed thence and entered into a certain mans house named justus one that worshipped god whose house joined hard to the synagogue 188 and crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the lord with all his house and many of the corinthians hearing believed and were baptized 189 then spake the lord to paul in the night by a vision be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace 1810 for i am with thee and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee for i have much people in this city 1811 and he continued there a year and six months teaching the word of god among them 1812 and when gallio was the deputy of achaia the jews made insurrection with one accord against paul and brought him to the judgment seat 1813 saying this fellow persuadeth men to worship god contrary to the law 1814 and when paul was now about to open his mouth gallio said unto the jews if it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness o ye jews reason would that i should bear with you 1815 but if it be a question of words and names and of your law look ye to it for i will be no judge of such matters 1816 and he drave them from the judgment seat 1817 then all the greeks took sosthenes the chief ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat and gallio cared for none of those things 1818 and paul after this tarried there yet a good while and then took his leave of the brethren and sailed thence into syria and with him priscilla and aquila having shorn his head in cenchrea for he had a vow 1819 and he came to ephesus and left them there but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews 1820 when they desired him to tarry longer time with them he consented not 1821 but bade them farewell saying i must by all means keep this feast that cometh in jerusalem but i will return again unto you if god will and he sailed from ephesus 1822 and when he had landed at caesarea and gone up and saluted the church he went down to antioch 1823 and after he had spent some time there he departed and went over all the country of galatia and phrygia in order strengthening all the disciples 1824 and a certain jew named apollos born at alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to ephesus 1825 this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only the baptism of john 1826 and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly 1827 and when he was disposed to pass into achaia the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come helped them much which had believed through grace 1828 for he mightily convinced the jews and that publickly shewing by the scriptures that jesus was christ 191 and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coasts came to ephesus and finding certain disciples 192 he said unto them have ye received the holy ghost since ye believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost 193 and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto johns baptism 194 then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus 195 when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus 196 and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied 197 and all the men were about twelve 198 and he went into the synagogue and spake boldly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of god 199 but when divers were hardened and believed not but spake evil of that way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples disputing daily in the school of one tyrannus 1910 and this continued by the space of two years so that all they which dwelt in asia heard the word of the lord jesus both jews and greeks 1911 and god wrought special miracles by the hands of paul 1912 so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them 1913 then certain of the vagabond jews exorcists took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the lord jesus saying we adjure you by jesus whom paul preacheth 1914 and there were seven sons of one sceva a jew and chief of the priests which did so 1915 and the evil spirit answered and said jesus i know and paul i know but who are ye 1916 and the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded 1917 and this was known to all the jews and greeks also dwelling at ephesus and fear fell on them all and the name of the lord jesus was magnified 1918 and many that believed came and confessed and shewed their deeds 1919 many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together and burned them before all men and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver 1920 so mightily grew the word of god and prevailed 1921 after these things were ended paul purposed in the spirit when he had passed through macedonia and achaia to go to jerusalem saying after i have been there i must also see rome 1922 so he sent into macedonia two of them that ministered unto him timotheus and erastus but he himself stayed in asia for a season 1923 and the same time there arose no small stir about that way 1924 for a certain man named demetrius a silversmith which made silver shrines for diana brought no small gain unto the craftsmen 1925 whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation and said sirs ye know that by this craft we have our wealth 1926 moreover ye see and hear that not alone at ephesus but almost throughout all asia this paul hath persuaded and turned away much people saying that they be no gods which are made with hands 1927 so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought but also that the temple of the great goddess diana should be despised and her magnificence should be destroyed whom all asia and the world worshippeth 1928 and when they heard these sayings they were full of wrath and cried out saying great is diana of the ephesians 1929 and the whole city was filled with confusion and having caught gaius and aristarchus men of macedonia pauls companions in travel they rushed with one accord into the theatre 1930 and when paul would have entered in unto the people the disciples suffered him not 1931 and certain of the chief of asia which were his friends sent unto him desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the theatre 1932 some therefore cried one thing and some another for the assembly was confused and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together 1933 and they drew alexander out of the multitude the jews putting him forward and alexander beckoned with the hand and would have made his defence unto the people 1934 but when they knew that he was a jew all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out great is diana of the ephesians 1935 and when the townclerk had appeased the people he said ye men of ephesus what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess diana and of the image which fell down from jupiter 1936 seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against ye ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly 1937 for ye have brought hither these men which are neither robbers of churches nor yet blasphemers of your goddess 1938 wherefore if demetrius and the craftsmen which are with him have a matter against any man the law is open and there are deputies let them implead one another 1939 but if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters it shall be determined in a lawful assembly 1940 for we are in danger to be called in question for this days uproar there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse 1941 and when he had thus spoken he dismissed the assembly 201 and after the uproar was ceased paul called unto him the disciples and embraced them and departed for to go into macedonia 202 and when he had gone over those parts and had given them much exhortation he came into greece 203 and there abode three months and when the jews laid wait for him as he was about to sail into syria he purposed to return through macedonia 204 and there accompanied him into asia sopater of berea and of the thessalonians aristarchus and secundus and gaius of derbe and timotheus and of asia tychicus and trophimus 205 these going before tarried for us at troas 206 and we sailed away from philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them to troas in five days where we abode seven days 207 and upon the first day of the week when the disciples came together to break bread paul preached unto them ready to depart on the morrow and continued his speech until midnight 208 and there were many lights in the upper chamber where they were gathered together 209 and there sat in a window a certain young man named eutychus being fallen into a deep sleep and as paul was long preaching he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead 2010 and paul went down and fell on him and embracing him said trouble not yourselves for his life is in him 2011 when he therefore was come up again and had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while even till break of day so he departed 2012 and they brought the young man alive and were not a little comforted 2013 and we went before to ship and sailed unto assos there intending to take in paul for so had he appointed minding himself to go afoot 2014 and when he met with us at assos we took him in and came to mitylene 2015 and we sailed thence and came the next day over against chios and the next day we arrived at samos and tarried at trogyllium and the next day we came to miletus 2016 for paul had determined to sail by ephesus because he would not spend the time in asia for he hasted if it were possible for him to be at jerusalem the day of pentecost 2017 and from miletus he sent to ephesus and called the elders of the church 2018 and when they were come to him he said unto them ye know from the first day that i came into asia after what manner i have been with you at all seasons 2019 serving the lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the jews 2020 and how i kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have shewed you and have taught you publickly and from house to house 2021 testifying both to the jews and also to the greeks repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ 2022 and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there 2023 save that the holy ghost witnesseth in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me 2024 but none of these things move me neither count i my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god 2025 and now behold i know that ye all among whom i have gone preaching the kingdom of god shall see my face no more 2026 wherefore i take you to record this day that i am pure from the blood of all men 2027 for i have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of god 2028 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over the which the holy ghost hath made you overseers to feed the church of god which he hath purchased with his own blood 2029 for i know this that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock 2030 also of your own selves shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after them 2031 therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears 2032 and now brethren i commend you to god and to the word of his grace which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified 2033 i have coveted no mans silver or gold or apparel 2034 yea ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to them that were with me 2035 i have shewed you all things how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the lord jesus how he said it is more blessed to give than to receive 2036 and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all 2037 and they all wept sore and fell on pauls neck and kissed him 2038 sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they should see his face no more and they accompanied him unto the ship 211 and it came to pass that after we were gotten from them and had launched we came with a straight course unto coos and the day following unto rhodes and from thence unto patara 212 and finding a ship sailing over unto phenicia we went aboard and set forth 213 now when we had discovered cyprus we left it on the left hand and sailed into syria and landed at tyre for there the ship was to unlade her burden 214 and finding disciples we tarried there seven days who said to paul through the spirit that he should not go up to jerusalem 215 and when we had accomplished those days we departed and went our way and they all brought us on our way with wives and children till we were out of the city and we kneeled down on the shore and prayed 216 and when we had taken our leave one of another we took ship and they returned home again 217 and when we had finished our course from tyre we came to ptolemais and saluted the brethren and abode with them one day 218 and the next day we that were of pauls company departed and came unto caesarea and we entered into the house of philip the evangelist which was one of the seven and abode with him 219 and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy 2110 and as we tarried there many days there came down from judaea a certain prophet named agabus 2111 and when he was come unto us he took pauls girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said thus saith the holy ghost so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles 2112 and when we heard these things both we and they of that place besought him not to go up to jerusalem 2113 then paul answered what mean ye to weep and to break mine heart for i am ready not to be bound only but also to die at jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus 2114 and when he would not be persuaded we ceased saying the will of the lord be done 2115 and after those days we took up our carriages and went up to jerusalem 2116 there went with us also certain of the disciples of caesarea and brought with them one mnason of cyprus an old disciple with whom we should lodge 2117 and when we were come to jerusalem the brethren received us gladly 2118 and the day following paul went in with us unto james and all the elders were present 2119 and when he had saluted them he declared particularly what things god had wrought among the gentiles by his ministry 2120 and when they heard it they glorified the lord and said unto him thou seest brother how many thousands of jews there are which believe and they are all zealous of the law 2121 and they are informed of thee that thou teachest all the jews which are among the gentiles to forsake moses saying that they ought not to circumcise their children neither to walk after the customs 2122 what is it therefore the multitude must needs come together for they will hear that thou art come 2123 do therefore this that we say to thee we have four men which have a vow on them 2124 them take and purify thyself with them and be at charges with them that they may shave their heads and all may know that those things whereof they were informed concerning thee are nothing but that thou thyself also walkest orderly and keepest the law 2125 as touching the gentiles which believe we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing save only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols and from blood and from strangled and from fornication 2126 then paul took the men and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification until that an offering should be offered for every one of them 2127 and when the seven days were almost ended the jews which were of asia when they saw him in the temple stirred up all the people and laid hands on him 2128 crying out men of israel help this is the man that teacheth all men every where against the people and the law and this place and further brought greeks also into the temple and hath polluted this holy place 2129 for they had seen before with him in the city trophimus an ephesian whom they supposed that paul had brought into the temple 2130 and all the city was moved and the people ran together and they took paul and drew him out of the temple and forthwith the doors were shut 2131 and as they went about to kill him tidings came unto the chief captain of the band that all jerusalem was in an uproar 2132 who immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down unto them and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers they left beating of paul 2133 then the chief captain came near and took him and commanded him to be bound with two chains and demanded who he was and what he had done 2134 and some cried one thing some another among the multitude and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult he commanded him to be carried into the castle 2135 and when he came upon the stairs so it was that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people 2136 for the multitude of the people followed after crying away with him 2137 and as paul was to be led into the castle he said unto the chief captain may i speak unto thee who said canst thou speak greek 2138 art not thou that egyptian which before these days madest an uproar and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers 2139 but paul said i am a man which am a jew of tarsus a city in cilicia a citizen of no mean city and i beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the people 2140 and when he had given him licence paul stood on the stairs and beckoned with the hand unto the people and when there was made a great silence he spake unto them in the hebrew tongue saying 221 men brethren and fathers hear ye my defence which i make now unto you 222 and when they heard that he spake in the hebrew tongue to them they kept the more silence and he saith 223 i am verily a man which am a jew born in tarsus a city in cilicia yet brought up in this city at the feet of gamaliel and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers and was zealous toward god as ye all are this day 224 and i persecuted this way unto the death binding and delivering into prisons both men and women 225 as also the high priest doth bear me witness and all the estate of the elders from whom also i received letters unto the brethren and went to damascus to bring them which were there bound unto jerusalem for to be punished 226 and it came to pass that as i made my journey and was come nigh unto damascus about noon suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me 227 and i fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me saul saul why persecutest thou me 228 and i answered who art thou lord and he said unto me i am jesus of nazareth whom thou persecutest 229 and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me 2210 and i said what shall i do lord and the lord said unto me arise and go into damascus and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do 2211 and when i could not see for the glory of that light being led by the hand of them that were with me i came into damascus 2212 and one ananias a devout man according to the law having a good report of all the jews which dwelt there 2213 came unto me and stood and said unto me brother saul receive thy sight and the same hour i looked up upon him 2214 and he said the god of our fathers hath chosen thee that thou shouldest know his will and see that just one and shouldest hear the voice of his mouth 2215 for thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard 2216 and now why tarriest thou arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins calling on the name of the lord 2217 and it came to pass that when i was come again to jerusalem even while i prayed in the temple i was in a trance 2218 and saw him saying unto me make haste and get thee quickly out of jerusalem for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me 2219 and i said lord they know that i imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee 2220 and when the blood of thy martyr stephen was shed i also was standing by and consenting unto his death and kept the raiment of them that slew him 2221 and he said unto me depart for i will send thee far hence unto the gentiles 2222 and they gave him audience unto this word and then lifted up their voices and said away with such a fellow from the earth for it is not fit that he should live 2223 and as they cried out and cast off their clothes and threw dust into the air 2224 the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle and bade that he should be examined by scourging that he might know wherefore they cried so against him 2225 and as they bound him with thongs paul said unto the centurion that stood by is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a roman and uncondemned 2226 when the centurion heard that he went and told the chief captain saying take heed what thou doest for this man is a roman 2227 then the chief captain came and said unto him tell me art thou a roman he said yea 2228 and the chief captain answered with a great sum obtained i this freedom and paul said but i was free born 2229 then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him and the chief captain also was afraid after he knew that he was a roman and because he had bound him 2230 on the morrow because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the jews he loosed him from his bands and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear and brought paul down and set him before them 231 and paul earnestly beholding the council said men and brethren i have lived in all good conscience before god until this day 232 and the high priest ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth 233 then said paul unto him god shall smite thee thou whited wall for sittest thou to judge me after the law and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law 234 and they that stood by said revilest thou gods high priest 235 then said paul i wist not brethren that he was the high priest for it is written thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people 236 but when paul perceived that the one part were sadducees and the other pharisees he cried out in the council men and brethren i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee of the hope and resurrection of the dead i am called in question 237 and when he had so said there arose a dissension between the pharisees and the sadducees and the multitude was divided 238 for the sadducees say that there is no resurrection neither angel nor spirit but the pharisees confess both 239 and there arose a great cry and the scribes that were of the pharisees part arose and strove saying we find no evil in this man but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him let us not fight against god 2310 and when there arose a great dissension the chief captain fearing lest paul should have been pulled in pieces of them commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the castle 2311 and the night following the lord stood by him and said be of good cheer paul for as thou hast testified of me in jerusalem so must thou bear witness also at rome 2312 and when it was day certain of the jews banded together and bound themselves under a curse saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed paul 2313 and they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy 2314 and they came to the chief priests and elders and said we have bound ourselves under a great curse that we will eat nothing until we have slain paul 2315 now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow as though ye would enquire something more perfectly concerning him and we or ever he come near are ready to kill him 2316 and when pauls sisters son heard of their lying in wait he went and entered into the castle and told paul 2317 then paul called one of the centurions unto him and said bring this young man unto the chief captain for he hath a certain thing to tell him 2318 so he took him and brought him to the chief captain and said paul the prisoner called me unto him and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee who hath something to say unto thee 2319 then the chief captain took him by the hand and went with him aside privately and asked him what is that thou hast to tell me 2320 and he said the jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down paul to morrow into the council as though they would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly 2321 but do not thou yield unto them for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men which have bound themselves with an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him and now are they ready looking for a promise from thee 2322 so the chief captain then let the young man depart and charged him see thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me 2323 and he called unto him two centurions saying make ready two hundred soldiers to go to caesarea and horsemen threescore and ten and spearmen two hundred at the third hour of the night 2324 and provide them beasts that they may set paul on and bring him safe unto felix the governor 2325 and he wrote a letter after this manner 2326 claudius lysias unto the most excellent governor felix sendeth greeting 2327 this man was taken of the jews and should have been killed of them then came i with an army and rescued him having understood that he was a roman 2328 and when i would have known the cause wherefore they accused him i brought him forth into their council 2329 whom i perceived to be accused of questions of their law but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds 2330 and when it was told me how that the jews laid wait for the man i sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him farewell 2331 then the soldiers as it was commanded them took paul and brought him by night to antipatris 2332 on the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the castle 2333 who when they came to caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor presented paul also before him 2334 and when the governor had read the letter he asked of what province he was and when he understood that he was of cilicia 2335 i will hear thee said he when thine accusers are also come and he commanded him to be kept in herods judgment hall 241 and after five days ananias the high priest descended with the elders and with a certain orator named tertullus who informed the governor against paul 242 and when he was called forth tertullus began to accuse him saying seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence 243 we accept it always and in all places most noble felix with all thankfulness 244 notwithstanding that i be not further tedious unto thee i pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words 245 for we have found this man a pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition among all the jews throughout the world and a ringleader of the sect of the nazarenes 246 who also hath gone about to profane the temple whom we took and would have judged according to our law 247 but the chief captain lysias came upon us and with great violence took him away out of our hands 248 commanding his accusers to come unto thee by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him 249 and the jews also assented saying that these things were so 2410 then paul after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak answered forasmuch as i know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation i do the more cheerfully answer for myself 2411 because that thou mayest understand that there are yet but twelve days since i went up to jerusalem for to worship 2412 and they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man neither raising up the people neither in the synagogues nor in the city 2413 neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me 2414 but this i confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship i the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets 2415 and have hope toward god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust 2416 and herein do i exercise myself to have always a conscience void to offence toward god and toward men 2417 now after many years i came to bring alms to my nation and offerings 2418 whereupon certain jews from asia found me purified in the temple neither with multitude nor with tumult 2419 who ought to have been here before thee and object if they had ought against me 2420 or else let these same here say if they have found any evil doing in me while i stood before the council 2421 except it be for this one voice that i cried standing among them touching the resurrection of the dead i am called in question by you this day 2422 and when felix heard these things having more perfect knowledge of that way he deferred them and said when lysias the chief captain shall come down i will know the uttermost of your matter 2423 and he commanded a centurion to keep paul and to let him have liberty and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him 2424 and after certain days when felix came with his wife drusilla which was a jewess he sent for paul and heard him concerning the faith in christ 2425 and as he reasoned of righteousness temperance and judgment to come felix trembled and answered go thy way for this time when i have a convenient season i will call for thee 2426 he hoped also that money should have been given him of paul that he might loose him wherefore he sent for him the oftener and communed with him 2427 but after two years porcius festus came into felix room and felix willing to shew the jews a pleasure left paul bound 251 now when festus was come into the province after three days he ascended from caesarea to jerusalem 252 then the high priest and the chief of the jews informed him against paul and besought him 253 and desired favour against him that he would send for him to jerusalem laying wait in the way to kill him 254 but festus answered that paul should be kept at caesarea and that he himself would depart shortly thither 255 let them therefore said he which among you are able go down with me and accuse this man if there be any wickedness in him 256 and when he had tarried among them more than ten days he went down unto caesarea and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded paul to be brought 257 and when he was come the jews which came down from jerusalem stood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against paul which they could not prove 258 while he answered for himself neither against the law of the jews neither against the temple nor yet against caesar have i offended any thing at all 259 but festus willing to do the jews a pleasure answered paul and said wilt thou go up to jerusalem and there be judged of these things before me 2510 then said paul i stand at caesars judgment seat where i ought to be judged to the jews have i done no wrong as thou very well knowest 2511 for if i be an offender or have committed any thing worthy of death i refuse not to die but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me no man may deliver me unto them i appeal unto caesar 2512 then festus when he had conferred with the council answered hast thou appealed unto caesar unto caesar shalt thou go 2513 and after certain days king agrippa and bernice came unto caesarea to salute festus 2514 and when they had been there many days festus declared pauls cause unto the king saying there is a certain man left in bonds by felix 2515 about whom when i was at jerusalem the chief priests and the elders of the jews informed me desiring to have judgment against him 2516 to whom i answered it is not the manner of the romans to deliver any man to die before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him 2517 therefore when they were come hither without any delay on the morrow i sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought forth 2518 against whom when the accusers stood up they brought none accusation of such things as i supposed 2519 but had certain questions against him of their own superstition and of one jesus which was dead whom paul affirmed to be alive 2520 and because i doubted of such manner of questions i asked him whether he would go to jerusalem and there be judged of these matters 2521 but when paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of augustus i commanded him to be kept till i might send him to caesar 2522 then agrippa said unto festus i would also hear the man myself to morrow said he thou shalt hear him 2523 and on the morrow when agrippa was come and bernice with great pomp and was entered into the place of hearing with the chief captains and principal men of the city at festus commandment paul was brought forth 2524 and festus said king agrippa and all men which are here present with us ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the jews have dealt with me both at jerusalem and also here crying that he ought not to live any longer 2525 but when i found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself hath appealed to augustus i have determined to send him 2526 of whom i have no certain thing to write unto my lord wherefore i have brought him forth before you and specially before thee o king agrippa that after examination had i might have somewhat to write 2527 for it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him 261 then agrippa said unto paul thou art permitted to speak for thyself then paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself 262 i think myself happy king agrippa because i shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof i am accused of the jews 263 especially because i know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the jews wherefore i beseech thee to hear me patiently 264 my manner of life from my youth which was at the first among mine own nation at jerusalem know all the jews 265 which knew me from the beginning if they would testify that after the most straitest sect of our religion i lived a pharisee 266 and now i stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of god unto our fathers 267 unto which promise our twelve tribes instantly serving god day and night hope to come for which hopes sake king agrippa i am accused of the jews 268 why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that god should raise the dead 269 i verily thought with myself that i ought to do many things contrary to the name of jesus of nazareth 2610 which thing i also did in jerusalem and many of the saints did i shut up in prison having received authority from the chief priests and when they were put to death i gave my voice against them 2611 and i punished them oft in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme and being exceedingly mad against them i persecuted them even unto strange cities 2612 whereupon as i went to damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests 2613 at midday o king i saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun shining round about me and them which journeyed with me 2614 and when we were all fallen to the earth i heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the hebrew tongue saul saul why persecutest thou me it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks 2615 and i said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom thou persecutest 2616 but rise and stand upon thy feet for i have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in the which i will appear unto thee 2617 delivering thee from the people and from the gentiles unto whom now i send thee 2618 to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me 2619 whereupon o king agrippa i was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision 2620 but shewed first unto them of damascus and at jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of judaea and then to the gentiles that they should repent and turn to god and do works meet for repentance 2621 for these causes the jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me 2622 having therefore obtained help of god i continue unto this day witnessing both to small and great saying none other things than those which the prophets and moses did say should come 2623 that christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should shew light unto the people and to the gentiles 2624 and as he thus spake for himself festus said with a loud voice paul thou art beside thyself much learning doth make thee mad 2625 but he said i am not mad most noble festus but speak forth the words of truth and soberness 2626 for the king knoweth of these things before whom also i speak freely for i am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him for this thing was not done in a corner 2627 king agrippa believest thou the prophets i know that thou believest 2628 then agrippa said unto paul almost thou persuadest me to be a christian 2629 and paul said i would to god that not only thou but also all that hear me this day were both almost and altogether such as i am except these bonds 2630 and when he had thus spoken the king rose up and the governor and bernice and they that sat with them 2631 and when they were gone aside they talked between themselves saying this man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds 2632 then said agrippa unto festus this man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto caesar 271 and when it was determined that we should sail into italy they delivered paul and certain other prisoners unto one named julius a centurion of augustus band 272 and entering into a ship of adramyttium we launched meaning to sail by the coasts of asia one aristarchus a macedonian of thessalonica being with us 273 and the next day we touched at sidon and julius courteously entreated paul and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself 274 and when we had launched from thence we sailed under cyprus because the winds were contrary 275 and when we had sailed over the sea of cilicia and pamphylia we came to myra a city of lycia 276 and there the centurion found a ship of alexandria sailing into italy and he put us therein 277 and when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were come over against cnidus the wind not suffering us we sailed under crete over against salmone 278 and hardly passing it came unto a place which is called the fair havens nigh whereunto was the city of lasea 279 now when much time was spent and when sailing was now dangerous because the fast was now already past paul admonished them 2710 and said unto them sirs i perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage not only of the lading and ship but also of our lives 2711 nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by paul 2712 and because the haven was not commodious to winter in the more part advised to depart thence also if by any means they might attain to phenice and there to winter which is an haven of crete and lieth toward the south west and north west 2713 and when the south wind blew softly supposing that they had obtained their purpose loosing thence they sailed close by crete 2714 but not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind called euroclydon 2715 and when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her drive 2716 and running under a certain island which is called clauda we had much work to come by the boat 2717 which when they had taken up they used helps undergirding the ship and fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands strake sail and so were driven 2718 and we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest the next day they lightened the ship 2719 and the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship 2720 and when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on us all hope that we should be saved was then taken away 2721 but after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from crete and to have gained this harm and loss 2722 and now i exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any mans life among you but of the ship 2723 for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and whom i serve 2724 saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath given thee all them that sail with thee 2725 wherefore sirs be of good cheer for i believe god that it shall be even as it was told me 2726 howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island 2727 but when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven up and down in adria about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country 2728 and sounded and found it twenty fathoms and when they had gone a little further they sounded again and found it fifteen fathoms 2729 then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day 2730 and as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship when they had let down the boat into the sea under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship 2731 paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers except these abide in the ship ye cannot be saved 2732 then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off 2733 and while the day was coming on paul besought them all to take meat saying this day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting having taken nothing 2734 wherefore i pray you to take some meat for this is for your health for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you 2735 and when he had thus spoken he took bread and gave thanks to god in presence of them all and when he had broken it he began to eat 2736 then were they all of good cheer and they also took some meat 2737 and we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls 2738 and when they had eaten enough they lightened the ship and cast out the wheat into the sea 2739 and when it was day they knew not the land but they discovered a certain creek with a shore into the which they were minded if it were possible to thrust in the ship 2740 and when they had taken up the anchors they committed themselves unto the sea and loosed the rudder bands and hoised up the mainsail to the wind and made toward shore 2741 and falling into a place where two seas met they ran the ship aground and the forepart stuck fast and remained unmoveable but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves 2742 and the soldiers counsel was to kill the prisoners lest any of them should swim out and escape 2743 but the centurion willing to save paul kept them from their purpose and commanded that they which could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and get to land 2744 and the rest some on boards and some on broken pieces of the ship and so it came to pass that they escaped all safe to land 281 and when they were escaped then they knew that the island was called melita 282 and the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received us every one because of the present rain and because of the cold 283 and when paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the heat and fastened on his hand 284 and when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he hath escaped the sea yet vengeance suffereth not to live 285 and he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm 286 howbeit they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a god 287 in the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island whose name was publius who received us and lodged us three days courteously 288 and it came to pass that the father of publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux to whom paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him 289 so when this was done others also which had diseases in the island came and were healed 2810 who also honoured us with many honours and when we departed they laded us with such things as were necessary 2811 and after three months we departed in a ship of alexandria which had wintered in the isle whose sign was castor and pollux 2812 and landing at syracuse we tarried there three days 2813 and from thence we fetched a compass and came to rhegium and after one day the south wind blew and we came the next day to puteoli 2814 where we found brethren and were desired to tarry with them seven days and so we went toward rome 2815 and from thence when the brethren heard of us they came to meet us as far as appii forum and the three taverns whom when paul saw he thanked god and took courage 2816 and when we came to rome the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard but paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him 2817 and it came to pass that after three days paul called the chief of the jews together and when they were come together he said unto them men and brethren though i have committed nothing against the people or customs of our fathers yet was i delivered prisoner from jerusalem into the hands of the romans 2818 who when they had examined me would have let me go because there was no cause of death in me 2819 but when the jews spake against it i was constrained to appeal unto caesar not that i had ought to accuse my nation of 2820 for this cause therefore have i called for you to see you and to speak with you because that for the hope of israel i am bound with this chain 2821 and they said unto him we neither received letters out of judaea concerning thee neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee 2822 but we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest for as concerning this sect we know that every where it is spoken against 2823 and when they had appointed him a day there came many to him into his lodging to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of god persuading them concerning jesus both out of the law of moses and out of the prophets from morning till evening 2824 and some believed the things which were spoken and some believed not 2825 and when they agreed not among themselves they departed after that paul had spoken one word well spake the holy ghost by esaias the prophet unto our fathers 2826 saying go unto this people and say hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and not perceive 2827 for the heart of this people is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes have they closed lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them 2828 be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles and that they will hear it 2829 and when he had said these words the jews departed and had great reasoning among themselves 2830 and paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto him 2831 preaching the kingdom of god and teaching those things which concern the lord jesus christ with all confidence no man forbidding him the epistle of paul the apostle to the romans 11 paul a servant of jesus christ called to be an apostle separated unto the gospel of god 12 which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures 13 concerning his son jesus christ our lord which was made of the seed of david according to the flesh 14 and declared to be the son of god with power according to the spirit of holiness by the resurrection from the dead 15 by whom we have received grace and apostleship for obedience to the faith among all nations for his name 16 among whom are ye also the called of jesus christ 17 to all that be in rome beloved of god called to be saints grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ 18 first i thank my god through jesus christ for you all that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world 19 for god is my witness whom i serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing i make mention of you always in my prayers 110 making request if by any means now at length i might have a prosperous journey by the will of god to come unto you 111 for i long to see you that i may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end ye may be established 112 that is that i may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me 113 now i would not have you ignorant brethren that oftentimes i purposed to come unto you but was let hitherto that i might have some fruit among you also even as among other gentiles 114 i am debtor both to the greeks and to the barbarians both to the wise and to the unwise 115 so as much as in me is i am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at rome also 116 for i am not ashamed of the gospel of christ for it is the power of god unto salvation to every one that believeth to the jew first and also to the greek 117 for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith 118 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness 119 because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath shewed it unto them 120 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse 121 because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened 122 professing themselves to be wise they became fools 123 and changed the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and fourfooted beasts and creeping things 124 wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves 125 who changed the truth of god into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the creator who is blessed for ever amen 126 for this cause god gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature 127 and likewise also the men leaving the natural use of the woman burned in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet 128 and even as they did not like to retain god in their knowledge god gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient 129 being filled with all unrighteousness fornication wickedness covetousness maliciousness full of envy murder debate deceit malignity whisperers 130 backbiters haters of god despiteful proud boasters inventors of evil things disobedient to parents 131 without understanding covenantbreakers without natural affection implacable unmerciful 132 who knowing the judgment of god that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only do the same but have pleasure in them that do them 21 therefore thou art inexcusable o man whosoever thou art that judgest for wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thyself for thou that judgest doest the same things 22 but we are sure that the judgment of god is according to truth against them which commit such things 23 and thinkest thou this o man that judgest them which do such things and doest the same that thou shalt escape the judgment of god 24 or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering not knowing that the goodness of god leadeth thee to repentance 25 but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of god 26 who will render to every man according to his deeds 27 to them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality eternal life 28 but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey unrighteousness indignation and wrath 29 tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the jew first and also of the gentile 210 but glory honour and peace to every man that worketh good to the jew first and also to the gentile 211 for there is no respect of persons with god 212 for as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law 213 for not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified 214 for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves 215 which shew the work of the law written in their hearts their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another 216 in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel 217 behold thou art called a jew and restest in the law and makest thy boast of god 218 and knowest his will and approvest the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the law 219 and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind a light of them which are in darkness 220 an instructor of the foolish a teacher of babes which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law 221 thou therefore which teachest another teachest thou not thyself thou that preachest a man should not steal dost thou steal 222 thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery dost thou commit adultery thou that abhorrest idols dost thou commit sacrilege 223 thou that makest thy boast of the law through breaking the law dishonourest thou god 224 for the name of god is blasphemed among the gentiles through you as it is written 225 for circumcision verily profiteth if thou keep the law but if thou be a breaker of the law thy circumcision is made uncircumcision 226 therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision 227 and shall not uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfil the law judge thee who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law 228 for he is not a jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh 229 but he is a jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of god 31 what advantage then hath the jew or what profit is there of circumcision 32 much every way chiefly because that unto them were committed the oracles of god 33 for what if some did not believe shall their unbelief make the faith of god without effect 34 god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and mightest overcome when thou art judged 35 but if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of god what shall we say is god unrighteous who taketh vengeance i speak as a man 36 god forbid for then how shall god judge the world 37 for if the truth of god hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory why yet am i also judged as a sinner 38 and not rather as we be slanderously reported and as some affirm that we say let us do evil that good may come whose damnation is just 39 what then are we better than they no in no wise for we have before proved both jews and gentiles that they are all under sin 310 as it is written there is none righteous no not one 311 there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god 312 they are all gone out of the way they are together become unprofitable there is none that doeth good no not one 313 their throat is an open sepulchre with their tongues they have used deceit the poison of asps is under their lips 314 whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness 315 their feet are swift to shed blood 316 destruction and misery are in their ways 317 and the way of peace have they not known 318 there is no fear of god before their eyes 319 now we know that what things soever the law saith it saith to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before god 320 therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight for by the law is the knowledge of sin 321 but now the righteousness of god without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets 322 even the righteousness of god which is by faith of jesus christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there is no difference 323 for all have sinned and come short of the glory of god 324 being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in christ jesus 325 whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of god 326 to declare i say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in jesus 327 where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of works nay but by the law of faith 328 therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law 329 is he the god of the jews only is he not also of the gentiles yes of the gentiles also 330 seeing it is one god which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith 331 do we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law 41 what shall we say then that abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found 42 for if abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to glory but not before god 43 for what saith the scripture abraham believed god and it was counted unto him for righteousness 44 now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace but of debt 45 but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness 46 even as david also describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom god imputeth righteousness without works 47 saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered 48 blessed is the man to whom the lord will not impute sin 49 cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to abraham for righteousness 410 how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision not in circumcision but in uncircumcision 411 and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also 412 and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised 413 for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith 414 for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect 415 because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression 416 therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all 417 as it is written i have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were 418 who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be 419 and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about an hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarahs womb 420 he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to god 421 and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform 422 and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness 423 now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him 424 but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up jesus our lord from the dead 425 who was delivered for our offences and was raised again for our justification 51 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ 52 by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god 53 and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience 54 and patience experience and experience hope 55 and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us 56 for when we were yet without strength in due time christ died for the ungodly 57 for scarcely for a righteous man will one die yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die 58 but god commendeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners christ died for us 59 much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him 510 for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life 511 and not only so but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received the atonement 512 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned 513 for until the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law 514 nevertheless death reigned from adam to moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of adams transgression who is the figure of him that was to come 515 but not as the offence so also is the free gift for if through the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of god and the gift by grace which is by one man jesus christ hath abounded unto many 516 and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift for the judgment was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offences unto justification 517 for if by one mans offence death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one jesus christ 518 therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life 519 for as by one mans disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous 520 moreover the law entered that the offence might abound but where sin abounded grace did much more abound 521 that as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord 61 what shall we say then shall we continue in sin that grace may abound 62 god forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein 63 know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death 64 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life 65 for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection 66 knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin 67 for he that is dead is freed from sin 68 now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him 69 knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him 610 for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto god 611 likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord 612 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof 613 neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god 614 for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace 615 what then shall we sin because we are not under the law but under grace god forbid 616 know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness 617 but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you 618 being then made free from sin ye became the servants of righteousness 619 i speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness 620 for when ye were the servants of sin ye were free from righteousness 621 what fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed for the end of those things is death 622 but now being made free from sin and become servants to god ye have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life 623 for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life through jesus christ our lord 71 know ye not brethren for i speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth 72 for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband 73 so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man 74 wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto god 75 for when we were in the flesh the motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death 76 but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter 77 what shall we say then is the law sin god forbid nay i had not known sin but by the law for i had not known lust except the law had said thou shalt not covet 78 but sin taking occasion by the commandment wrought in me all manner of concupiscence for without the law sin was dead 79 for i was alive without the law once but when the commandment came sin revived and i died 710 and the commandment which was ordained to life i found to be unto death 711 for sin taking occasion by the commandment deceived me and by it slew me 712 wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good 713 was then that which is good made death unto me god forbid but sin that it might appear sin working death in me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful 714 for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin 715 for that which i do i allow not for what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i 716 if then i do that which i would not i consent unto the law that it is good 717 now then it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me 718 for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not 719 for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do 720 now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me 721 i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me 722 for i delight in the law of god after the inward man 723 but i see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members 724 o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death 725 i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin 81 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit 82 for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death 83 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh 84 that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit 85 for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit 86 for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace 87 because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be 88 so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god 89 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his 810 and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness 811 but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you 812 therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh 813 for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live 814 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god 815 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father 816 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god 817 and if children then heirs heirs of god and jointheirs with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together 818 for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us 819 for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god 820 for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope 821 because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god 822 for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now 823 and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body 824 for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why doth he yet hope for 825 but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it 826 likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered 827 and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of god 828 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose 829 for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren 830 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified 831 what shall we then say to these things if god be for us who can be against us 832 he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things 833 who shall lay any thing to the charge of gods elect it is god that justifieth 834 who is he that condemneth it is christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of god who also maketh intercession for us 835 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword 836 as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter 837 nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us 838 for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come 839 nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord 91 i say the truth in christ i lie not my conscience also bearing me witness in the holy ghost 92 that i have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart 93 for i could wish that myself were accursed from christ for my brethren my kinsmen according to the flesh 94 who are israelites to whom pertaineth the adoption and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of god and the promises 95 whose are the fathers and of whom as concerning the flesh christ came who is over all god blessed for ever amen 96 not as though the word of god hath taken none effect for they are not all israel which are of israel 97 neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all children but in isaac shall thy seed be called 98 that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of god but the children of the promise are counted for the seed 99 for this is the word of promise at this time will i come and sarah shall have a son 910 and not only this but when rebecca also had conceived by one even by our father isaac 911 for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of god according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth 912 it was said unto her the elder shall serve the younger 913 as it is written jacob have i loved but esau have i hated 914 what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with god god forbid 915 for he saith to moses i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion 916 so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runneth but of god that sheweth mercy 917 for the scripture saith unto pharaoh even for this same purpose have i raised thee up that i might shew my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth 918 therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth 919 thou wilt say then unto me why doth he yet find fault for who hath resisted his will 920 nay but o man who art thou that repliest against god shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast thou made me thus 921 hath not the potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour 922 what if god willing to shew his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction 923 and that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy which he had afore prepared unto glory 924 even us whom he hath called not of the jews only but also of the gentiles 925 as he saith also in osee i will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved 926 and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the living god 927 esaias also crieth concerning israel though the number of the children of israel be as the sand of the sea a remnant shall be saved 928 for he will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness because a short work will the lord make upon the earth 929 and as esaias said before except the lord of sabaoth had left us a seed we had been as sodoma and been made like unto gomorrha 930 what shall we say then that the gentiles which followed not after righteousness have attained to righteousness even the righteousness which is of faith 931 but israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness 932 wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumblingstone 933 as it is written behold i lay in sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed 101 brethren my hearts desire and prayer to god for israel is that they might be saved 102 for i bear them record that they have a zeal of god but not according to knowledge 103 for they being ignorant of gods righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of god 104 for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth 105 for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doeth those things shall live by them 106 but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down from above 107 or who shall descend into the deep that is to bring up christ again from the dead 108 but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart that is the word of faith which we preach 109 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved 1010 for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation 1011 for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed 1012 for there is no difference between the jew and the greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him 1013 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved 1014 how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher 1015 and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things 1016 but they have not all obeyed the gospel for esaias saith lord who hath believed our report 1017 so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god 1018 but i say have they not heard yes verily their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world 1019 but i say did not israel know first moses saith i will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people and by a foolish nation i will anger you 1020 but esaias is very bold and saith i was found of them that sought me not i was made manifest unto them that asked not after me 1021 but to israel he saith all day long i have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people 111 i say then hath god cast away his people god forbid for i also am an israelite of the seed of abraham of the tribe of benjamin 112 god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew wot ye not what the scripture saith of elias how he maketh intercession to god against israel saying 113 lord they have killed thy prophets and digged down thine altars and i am left alone and they seek my life 114 but what saith the answer of god unto him i have reserved to myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to the image of baal 115 even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace 116 and if by grace then is it no more of works otherwise grace is no more grace but if it be of works then it is no more grace otherwise work is no more work 117 what then israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for but the election hath obtained it and the rest were blinded 118 according as it is written god hath given them the spirit of slumber eyes that they should not see and ears that they should not hear unto this day 119 and david saith let their table be made a snare and a trap and a stumblingblock and a recompence unto them 1110 let their eyes be darkened that they may not see and bow down their back alway 1111 i say then have they stumbled that they should fall god forbid but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the gentiles for to provoke them to jealousy 1112 now if the fall of them be the riches of the world and the diminishing of them the riches of the gentiles how much more their fulness 1113 for i speak to you gentiles inasmuch as i am the apostle of the gentiles i magnify mine office 1114 if by any means i may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh and might save some of them 1115 for if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world what shall the receiving of them be but life from the dead 1116 for if the firstfruit be holy the lump is also holy and if the root be holy so are the branches 1117 and if some of the branches be broken off and thou being a wild olive tree wert graffed in among them and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree 1118 boast not against the branches but if thou boast thou bearest not the root but the root thee 1119 thou wilt say then the branches were broken off that i might be graffed in 1120 well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not highminded but fear 1121 for if god spared not the natural branches take heed lest he also spare not thee 1122 behold therefore the goodness and severity of god on them which fell severity but toward thee goodness if thou continue in his goodness otherwise thou also shalt be cut off 1123 and they also if they abide not still in unbelief shall be graffed in for god is able to graff them in again 1124 for if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree how much more shall these which be the natural branches be graffed into their own olive tree 1125 for i would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery lest ye should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to israel until the fulness of the gentiles be come in 1126 and so all israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of sion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from jacob 1127 for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sins 1128 as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved for the fathers sakes 1129 for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance 1130 for as ye in times past have not believed god yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief 1131 even so have these also now not believed that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy 1132 for god hath concluded them all in unbelief that he might have mercy upon all 1133 o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out 1134 for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor 1135 or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again 1136 for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory for ever amen 121 i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service 122 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god 123 for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god hath dealt to every man the measure of faith 124 for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office 125 so we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another 126 having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith 127 or ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teaching 128 or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that sheweth mercy with cheerfulness 129 let love be without dissimulation abhor that which is evil cleave to that which is good 1210 be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honour preferring one another 1211 not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord 1212 rejoicing in hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer 1213 distributing to the necessity of saints given to hospitality 1214 bless them which persecute you bless and curse not 1215 rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep 1216 be of the same mind one toward another mind not high things but condescend to men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits 1217 recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men 1218 if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men 1219 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place unto wrath for it is written vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord 1220 therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head 1221 be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good 131 let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god 132 whosoever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation 133 for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil wilt thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same 134 for he is the minister of god to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil 135 wherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake 136 for for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are gods ministers attending continually upon this very thing 137 render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom fear to whom fear honour to whom honour 138 owe no man any thing but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law 139 for this thou shalt not commit adultery thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not bear false witness thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself 1310 love worketh no ill to his neighbour therefore love is the fulfilling of the law 1311 and that knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed 1312 the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armour of light 1313 let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying 1314 but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts thereof 141 him that is weak in the faith receive ye but not to doubtful disputations 142 for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs 143 let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for god hath received him 144 who art thou that judgest another mans servant to his own master he standeth or falleth yea he shall be holden up for god is able to make him stand 145 one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind 146 he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the lord and he that regardeth not the day to the lord he doth not regard it he that eateth eateth to the lord for he giveth god thanks and he that eateth not to the lord he eateth not and giveth god thanks 147 for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself 148 for whether we live we live unto the lord and whether we die we die unto the lord whether we live therefore or die we are the lords 149 for to this end christ both died and rose and revived that he might be lord both of the dead and living 1410 but why dost thou judge thy brother or why dost thou set at nought thy brother for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of christ 1411 for it is written as i live saith the lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to god 1412 so then every one of us shall give account of himself to god 1413 let us not therefore judge one another any more but judge this rather that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brothers way 1414 i know and am persuaded by the lord jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean to him it is unclean 1415 but if thy brother be grieved with thy meat now walkest thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom christ died 1416 let not then your good be evil spoken of 1417 for the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost 1418 for he that in these things serveth christ is acceptable to god and approved of men 1419 let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another 1420 for meat destroy not the work of god all things indeed are pure but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence 1421 it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak 1422 hast thou faith have it to thyself before god happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth 1423 and he that doubteth is damned if he eat because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever is not of faith is sin 151 we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves 152 let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification 153 for even christ pleased not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me 154 for whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope 155 now the god of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to christ jesus 156 that ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify god even the father of our lord jesus christ 157 wherefore receive ye one another as christ also received us to the glory of god 158 now i say that jesus christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of god to confirm the promises made unto the fathers 159 and that the gentiles might glorify god for his mercy as it is written for this cause i will confess to thee among the gentiles and sing unto thy name 1510 and again he saith rejoice ye gentiles with his people 1511 and again praise the lord all ye gentiles and laud him all ye people 1512 and again esaias saith there shall be a root of jesse and he that shall rise to reign over the gentiles in him shall the gentiles trust 1513 now the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that ye may abound in hope through the power of the holy ghost 1514 and i myself also am persuaded of you my brethren that ye also are full of goodness filled with all knowledge able also to admonish one another 1515 nevertheless brethren i have written the more boldly unto you in some sort as putting you in mind because of the grace that is given to me of god 1516 that i should be the minister of jesus christ to the gentiles ministering the gospel of god that the offering up of the gentiles might be acceptable being sanctified by the holy ghost 1517 i have therefore whereof i may glory through jesus christ in those things which pertain to god 1518 for i will not dare to speak of any of those things which christ hath not wrought by me to make the gentiles obedient by word and deed 1519 through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god so that from jerusalem and round about unto illyricum i have fully preached the gospel of christ 1520 yea so have i strived to preach the gospel not where christ was named lest i should build upon another mans foundation 1521 but as it is written to whom he was not spoken of they shall see and they that have not heard shall understand 1522 for which cause also i have been much hindered from coming to you 1523 but now having no more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come unto you 1524 whensoever i take my journey into spain i will come to you for i trust to see you in my journey and to be brought on my way thitherward by you if first i be somewhat filled with your company 1525 but now i go unto jerusalem to minister unto the saints 1526 for it hath pleased them of macedonia and achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at jerusalem 1527 it hath pleased them verily and their debtors they are for if the gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things 1528 when therefore i have performed this and have sealed to them this fruit i will come by you into spain 1529 and i am sure that when i come unto you i shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of christ 1530 now i beseech you brethren for the lord jesus christs sake and for the love of the spirit that ye strive together with me in your prayers to god for me 1531 that i may be delivered from them that do not believe in judaea and that my service which i have for jerusalem may be accepted of the saints 1532 that i may come unto you with joy by the will of god and may with you be refreshed 1533 now the god of peace be with you all amen 161 i commend unto you phebe our sister which is a servant of the church which is at cenchrea 162 that ye receive her in the lord as becometh saints and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you for she hath been a succourer of many and of myself also 163 greet priscilla and aquila my helpers in christ jesus 164 who have for my life laid down their own necks unto whom not only i give thanks but also all the churches of the gentiles 165 likewise greet the church that is in their house salute my wellbeloved epaenetus who is the firstfruits of achaia unto christ 166 greet mary who bestowed much labour on us 167 salute andronicus and junia my kinsmen and my fellowprisoners who are of note among the apostles who also were in christ before me 168 greet amplias my beloved in the lord 169 salute urbane our helper in christ and stachys my beloved 1610 salute apelles approved in christ salute them which are of aristobulus household 1611 salute herodion my kinsman greet them that be of the household of narcissus which are in the lord 1612 salute tryphena and tryphosa who labour in the lord salute the beloved persis which laboured much in the lord 1613 salute rufus chosen in the lord and his mother and mine 1614 salute asyncritus phlegon hermas patrobas hermes and the brethren which are with them 1615 salute philologus and julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints which are with them 1616 salute one another with an holy kiss the churches of christ salute you 1617 now i beseech you brethren mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them 1618 for they that are such serve not our lord jesus christ but their own belly and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple 1619 for your obedience is come abroad unto all men i am glad therefore on your behalf but yet i would have you wise unto that which is good and simple concerning evil 1620 and the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen 1621 timotheus my workfellow and lucius and jason and sosipater my kinsmen salute you 1622 i tertius who wrote this epistle salute you in the lord 1623 gaius mine host and of the whole church saluteth you erastus the chamberlain of the city saluteth you and quartus a brother 1624 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen 1625 now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began 1626 but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nations for the obedience of faith 1627 to god only wise be glory through jesus christ for ever amen the first epistle of paul the apostle to the corinthians 11 paul called to be an apostle of jesus christ through the will of god and sosthenes our brother 12 unto the church of god which is at corinth to them that are sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints with all that in every place call upon the name of jesus christ our lord both theirs and ours 13 grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ 14 i thank my god always on your behalf for the grace of god which is given you by jesus christ 15 that in every thing ye are enriched by him in all utterance and in all knowledge 16 even as the testimony of christ was confirmed in you 17 so that ye come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our lord jesus christ 18 who shall also confirm you unto the end that ye may be blameless in the day of our lord jesus christ 19 god is faithful by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his son jesus christ our lord 110 now i beseech you brethren by the name of our lord jesus christ that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment 111 for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the house of chloe that there are contentions among you 112 now this i say that every one of you saith i am of paul and i of apollos and i of cephas and i of christ 113 is christ divided was paul crucified for you or were ye baptized in the name of paul 114 i thank god that i baptized none of you but crispus and gaius 115 lest any should say that i had baptized in mine own name 116 and i baptized also the household of stephanas besides i know not whether i baptized any other 117 for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with wisdom of words lest the cross of christ should be made of none effect 118 for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god 119 for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent 120 where is the wise where is the scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not god made foolish the wisdom of this world 121 for after that in the wisdom of god the world by wisdom knew not god it pleased god by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe 122 for the jews require a sign and the greeks seek after wisdom 123 but we preach christ crucified unto the jews a stumblingblock and unto the greeks foolishness 124 but unto them which are called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god 125 because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men 126 for ye see your calling brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called 127 but god hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty 128 and base things of the world and things which are despised hath god chosen yea and things which are not to bring to nought things that are 129 that no flesh should glory in his presence 130 but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption 131 that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord 21 and i brethren when i came to you came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god 22 for i determined not to know any thing among you save jesus christ and him crucified 23 and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling 24 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of mans wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power 25 that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god 26 howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to nought 27 but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory 28 which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory 29 but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him 210 but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god 211 for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god 212 now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god 213 which things also we speak not in the words which mans wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual 214 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned 215 but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man 216 for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ 31 and i brethren could not speak unto you as unto spiritual but as unto carnal even as unto babes in christ 32 i have fed you with milk and not with meat for hitherto ye were not able to bear it neither yet now are ye able 33 for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men 34 for while one saith i am of paul and another i am of apollos are ye not carnal 35 who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers by whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man 36 i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase 37 so then neither is he that planteth any thing neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase 38 now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour 39 for we are labourers together with god ye are gods husbandry ye are gods building 310 according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise masterbuilder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon 311 for other foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is jesus christ 312 now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay stubble 313 every mans work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is 314 if any mans work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward 315 if any mans work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire 316 know ye not that ye are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you 317 if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple ye are 318 let no man deceive himself if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world let him become a fool that he may be wise 319 for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with god for it is written he taketh the wise in their own craftiness 320 and again the lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise that they are vain 321 therefore let no man glory in men for all things are yours 322 whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come all are yours 323 and ye are christs and christ is gods 41 let a man so account of us as of the ministers of christ and stewards of the mysteries of god 42 moreover it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful 43 but with me it is a very small thing that i should be judged of you or of mans judgment yea i judge not mine own self 44 for i know nothing by myself yet am i not hereby justified but he that judgeth me is the lord 45 therefore judge nothing before the time until the lord come who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have praise of god 46 and these things brethren i have in a figure transferred to myself and to apollos for your sakes that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another 47 for who maketh thee to differ from another and what hast thou that thou didst not receive now if thou didst receive it why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it 48 now ye are full now ye are rich ye have reigned as kings without us and i would to god ye did reign that we also might reign with you 49 for i think that god hath set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men 410 we are fools for christs sake but ye are wise in christ we are weak but ye are strong ye are honourable but we are despised 411 even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace 412 and labour working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it 413 being defamed we intreat we are made as the filth of the world and are the offscouring of all things unto this day 414 i write not these things to shame you but as my beloved sons i warn you 415 for though ye have ten thousand instructers in christ yet have ye not many fathers for in christ jesus i have begotten you through the gospel 416 wherefore i beseech you be ye followers of me 417 for this cause have i sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved son and faithful in the lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in christ as i teach every where in every church 418 now some are puffed up as though i would not come to you 419 but i will come to you shortly if the lord will and will know not the speech of them which are puffed up but the power 420 for the kingdom of god is not in word but in power 421 what will ye shall i come unto you with a rod or in love and in the spirit of meekness 51 it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the gentiles that one should have his fathers wife 52 and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you 53 for i verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already as though i were present concerning him that hath so done this deed 54 in the name of our lord jesus christ when ye are gathered together and my spirit with the power of our lord jesus christ 55 to deliver such an one unto satan for the destruction of the flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the lord jesus 56 your glorying is not good know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump 57 purge out therefore the old leaven that ye may be a new lump as ye are unleavened for even christ our passover is sacrificed for us 58 therefore let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth 59 i wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators 510 yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters for then must ye needs go out of the world 511 but now i have written unto you not to keep company if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner with such an one no not to eat 512 for what have i to do to judge them also that are without do not ye judge them that are within 513 but them that are without god judgeth therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person 61 dare any of you having a matter against another go to law before the unjust and not before the saints 62 do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters 63 know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life 64 if then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church 65 i speak to your shame is it so that there is not a wise man among you no not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren 66 but brother goeth to law with brother and that before the unbelievers 67 now therefore there is utterly a fault among you because ye go to law one with another why do ye not rather take wrong why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded 68 nay ye do wrong and defraud and that your brethren 69 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of god be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind 610 nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of god 611 and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the lord jesus and by the spirit of our god 612 all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but i will not be brought under the power of any 613 meats for the belly and the belly for meats but god shall destroy both it and them now the body is not for fornication but for the lord and the lord for the body 614 and god hath both raised up the lord and will also raise up us by his own power 615 know ye not that your bodies are the members of christ shall i then take the members of christ and make them the members of an harlot god forbid 616 what know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh 617 but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit 618 flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body 619 what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own 620 for ye are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods 71 now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me it is good for a man not to touch a woman 72 nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband 73 let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife unto the husband 74 the wife hath not power of her own body but the husband and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife 75 defraud ye not one the other except it be with consent for a time that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again that satan tempt you not for your incontinency 76 but i speak this by permission and not of commandment 77 for i would that all men were even as i myself but every man hath his proper gift of god one after this manner and another after that 78 i say therefore to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as i 79 but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry than to burn 710 and unto the married i command yet not i but the lord let not the wife depart from her husband 711 but and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife 712 but to the rest speak i not the lord if any brother hath a wife that believeth not and she be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away 713 and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if he be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him 714 for the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy 715 but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases but god hath called us to peace 716 for what knowest thou o wife whether thou shalt save thy husband or how knowest thou o man whether thou shalt save thy wife 717 but as god hath distributed to every man as the lord hath called every one so let him walk and so ordain i in all churches 718 is any man called being circumcised let him not become uncircumcised is any called in uncircumcision let him not be circumcised 719 circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of god 720 let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called 721 art thou called being a servant care not for it but if thou mayest be made free use it rather 722 for he that is called in the lord being a servant is the lords freeman likewise also he that is called being free is christs servant 723 ye are bought with a price be not ye the servants of men 724 brethren let every man wherein he is called therein abide with god 725 now concerning virgins i have no commandment of the lord yet i give my judgment as one that hath obtained mercy of the lord to be faithful 726 i suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress i say that it is good for a man so to be 727 art thou bound unto a wife seek not to be loosed art thou loosed from a wife seek not a wife 728 but and if thou marry thou hast not sinned and if a virgin marry she hath not sinned nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh but i spare you 729 but this i say brethren the time is short it remaineth that both they that have wives be as though they had none 730 and they that weep as though they wept not and they that rejoice as though they rejoiced not and they that buy as though they possessed not 731 and they that use this world as not abusing it for the fashion of this world passeth away 732 but i would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord how he may please the lord 733 but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world how he may please his wife 734 there is difference also between a wife and a virgin the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and in spirit but she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband 735 and this i speak for your own profit not that i may cast a snare upon you but for that which is comely and that ye may attend upon the lord without distraction 736 but if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin if she pass the flower of her age and need so require let him do what he will he sinneth not let them marry 737 nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart having no necessity but hath power over his own will and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin doeth well 738 so then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better 739 the wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth but if her husband be dead she is at liberty to be married to whom she will only in the lord 740 but she is happier if she so abide after my judgment and i think also that i have the spirit of god 81 now as touching things offered unto idols we know that we all have knowledge knowledge puffeth up but charity edifieth 82 and if any man think that he knoweth any thing he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know 83 but if any man love god the same is known of him 84 as concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols we know that an idol is nothing in the world and that there is none other god but one 85 for though there be that are called gods whether in heaven or in earth as there be gods many and lords many 86 but to us there is but one god the father of whom are all things and we in him and one lord jesus christ by whom are all things and we by him 87 howbeit there is not in every man that knowledge for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat it as a thing offered unto an idol and their conscience being weak is defiled 88 but meat commendeth us not to god for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worse 89 but take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak 810 for if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idols temple shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols 811 and through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish for whom christ died 812 but when ye sin so against the brethren and wound their weak conscience ye sin against christ 813 wherefore if meat make my brother to offend i will eat no flesh while the world standeth lest i make my brother to offend 91 am i not an apostle am i not free have i not seen jesus christ our lord are not ye my work in the lord 92 if i be not an apostle unto others yet doubtless i am to you for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the lord 93 mine answer to them that do examine me is this 94 have we not power to eat and to drink 95 have we not power to lead about a sister a wife as well as other apostles and as the brethren of the lord and cephas 96 or i only and barnabas have not we power to forbear working 97 who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges who planteth a vineyard and eateth not of the fruit thereof or who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock 98 say i these things as a man or saith not the law the same also 99 for it is written in the law of moses thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn doth god take care for oxen 910 or saith he it altogether for our sakes for our sakes no doubt this is written that he that ploweth should plow in hope and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope 911 if we have sown unto you spiritual things is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things 912 if others be partakers of this power over you are not we rather nevertheless we have not used this power but suffer all things lest we should hinder the gospel of christ 913 do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live of the things of the temple and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar 914 even so hath the lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel 915 but i have used none of these things neither have i written these things that it should be so done unto me for it were better for me to die than that any man should make my glorying void 916 for though i preach the gospel i have nothing to glory of for necessity is laid upon me yea woe is unto me if i preach not the gospel 917 for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me 918 what is my reward then verily that when i preach the gospel i may make the gospel of christ without charge that i abuse not my power in the gospel 919 for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more 920 and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law 921 to them that are without law as without law being not without law to god but under the law to christ that i might gain them that are without law 922 to the weak became i as weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that i might by all means save some 923 and this i do for the gospels sake that i might be partaker thereof with you 924 know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain 925 and every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown but we an incorruptible 926 i therefore so run not as uncertainly so fight i not as one that beateth the air 927 but i keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when i have preached to others i myself should be a castaway 101 moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea 102 and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea 103 and did all eat the same spiritual meat 104 and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ 105 but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness 106 now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted 107 neither be ye idolaters as were some of them as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play 108 neither let us commit fornication as some of them committed and fell in one day three and twenty thousand 109 neither let us tempt christ as some of them also tempted and were destroyed of serpents 1010 neither murmur ye as some of them also murmured and were destroyed of the destroyer 1011 now all these things happened unto them for ensamples and they are written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come 1012 wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall 1013 there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but god is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape that ye may be able to bear it 1014 wherefore my dearly beloved flee from idolatry 1015 i speak as to wise men judge ye what i say 1016 the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of christ 1017 for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread 1018 behold israel after the flesh are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar 1019 what say i then that the idol is any thing or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing 1020 but i say that the things which the gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to devils and not to god and i would not that ye should have fellowship with devils 1021 ye cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of devils ye cannot be partakers of the lords table and of the table of devils 1022 do we provoke the lord to jealousy are we stronger than he 1023 all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not 1024 let no man seek his own but every man anothers wealth 1025 whatsoever is sold in the shambles that eat asking no question for conscience sake 1026 for the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof 1027 if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and ye be disposed to go whatsoever is set before you eat asking no question for conscience sake 1028 but if any man say unto you this is offered in sacrifice unto idols eat not for his sake that shewed it and for conscience sake for the earth is the lords and the fulness thereof 1029 conscience i say not thine own but of the other for why is my liberty judged of another mans conscience 1030 for if i by grace be a partaker why am i evil spoken of for that for which i give thanks 1031 whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatsoever ye do do all to the glory of god 1032 give none offence neither to the jews nor to the gentiles nor to the church of god 1033 even as i please all men in all things not seeking mine own profit but the profit of many that they may be saved 111 be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ 112 now i praise you brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances as i delivered them to you 113 but i would have you know that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of christ is god 114 every man praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonoureth his head 115 but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven 116 for if the woman be not covered let her also be shorn but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven let her be covered 117 for a man indeed ought not to cover his head forasmuch as he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of the man 118 for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man 119 neither was the man created for the woman but the woman for the man 1110 for this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels 1111 nevertheless neither is the man without the woman neither the woman without the man in the lord 1112 for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things of god 1113 judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto god uncovered 1114 doth not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him 1115 but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering 1116 but if any man seem to be contentious we have no such custom neither the churches of god 1117 now in this that i declare unto you i praise you not that ye come together not for the better but for the worse 1118 for first of all when ye come together in the church i hear that there be divisions among you and i partly believe it 1119 for there must be also heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you 1120 when ye come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the lords supper 1121 for in eating every one taketh before other his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken 1122 what have ye not houses to eat and to drink in or despise ye the church of god and shame them that have not what shall i say to you shall i praise you in this i praise you not 1123 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread 1124 and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me 1125 after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me 1126 for as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup ye do shew the lords death till he come 1127 wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord 1128 but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup 1129 for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lords body 1130 for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep 1131 for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged 1132 but when we are judged we are chastened of the lord that we should not be condemned with the world 1133 wherefore my brethren when ye come together to eat tarry one for another 1134 and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come 121 now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant 122 ye know that ye were gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols even as ye were led 123 wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god calleth jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost 124 now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit 125 and there are differences of administrations but the same lord 126 and there are diversities of operations but it is the same god which worketh all in all 127 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit withal 128 for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit 129 to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit 1210 to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another divers kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues 1211 but all these worketh that one and the selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will 1212 for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is christ 1213 for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit 1214 for the body is not one member but many 1215 if the foot shall say because i am not the hand i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body 1216 and if the ear shall say because i am not the eye i am not of the body is it therefore not of the body 1217 if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling 1218 but now hath god set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him 1219 and if they were all one member where were the body 1220 but now are they many members yet but one body 1221 and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you 1222 nay much more those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary 1223 and those members of the body which we think to be less honourable upon these we bestow more abundant honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness 1224 for our comely parts have no need but god hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked 1225 that there should be no schism in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another 1226 and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all the members rejoice with it 1227 now ye are the body of christ and members in particular 1228 and god hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues 1229 are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers are all workers of miracles 1230 have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret 1231 but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet shew i unto you a more excellent way 131 though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal 132 and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing 133 and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing 134 charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up 135 doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil 136 rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth 137 beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things 138 charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away 139 for we know in part and we prophesy in part 1310 but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away 1311 when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things 1312 for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known 1313 and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity 141 follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy 142 for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto god for no man understandeth him howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries 143 but he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort 144 he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church 145 i would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying 146 now brethren if i come unto you speaking with tongues what shall i profit you except i shall speak to you either by revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by doctrine 147 and even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or harped 148 for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle 149 so likewise ye except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall speak into the air 1410 there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification 1411 therefore if i know not the meaning of the voice i shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me 1412 even so ye forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church 1413 wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret 1414 for if i pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful 1415 what is it then i will pray with the spirit and i will pray with the understanding also i will sing with the spirit and i will sing with the understanding also 1416 else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say amen at thy giving of thanks seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest 1417 for thou verily givest thanks well but the other is not edified 1418 i thank my god i speak with tongues more than ye all 1419 yet in the church i had rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice i might teach others also than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue 1420 brethren be not children in understanding howbeit in malice be ye children but in understanding be men 1421 in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips will i speak unto this people and yet for all that will they not hear me saith the lord 1422 wherefore tongues are for a sign not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe 1423 if therefore the whole church be come together into one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad 1424 but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all 1425 and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship god and report that god is in you of a truth 1426 how is it then brethren when ye come together every one of you hath a psalm hath a doctrine hath a tongue hath a revelation hath an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying 1427 if any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at the most by three and that by course and let one interpret 1428 but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to god 1429 let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge 1430 if any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by let the first hold his peace 1431 for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted 1432 and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets 1433 for god is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints 1434 let your women keep silence in the churches for it is not permitted unto them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law 1435 and if they will learn any thing let them ask their husbands at home for it is a shame for women to speak in the church 1436 what came the word of god out from you or came it unto you only 1437 if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord 1438 but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant 1439 wherefore brethren covet to prophesy and forbid not to speak with tongues 1440 let all things be done decently and in order 151 moreover brethren i declare unto you the gospel which i preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand 152 by which also ye are saved if ye keep in memory what i preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain 153 for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures 154 and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures 155 and that he was seen of cephas then of the twelve 156 after that he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once of whom the greater part remain unto this present but some are fallen asleep 157 after that he was seen of james then of all the apostles 158 and last of all he was seen of me also as of one born out of due time 159 for i am the least of the apostles that am not meet to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god 1510 but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i laboured more abundantly than they all yet not i but the grace of god which was with me 1511 therefore whether it were i or they so we preach and so ye believed 1512 now if christ be preached that he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead 1513 but if there be no resurrection of the dead then is christ not risen 1514 and if christ be not risen then is our preaching vain and your faith is also vain 1515 yea and we are found false witnesses of god because we have testified of god that he raised up christ whom he raised not up if so be that the dead rise not 1516 for if the dead rise not then is not christ raised 1517 and if christ be not raised your faith is vain ye are yet in your sins 1518 then they also which are fallen asleep in christ are perished 1519 if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable 1520 but now is christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept 1521 for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead 1522 for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive 1523 but every man in his own order christ the firstfruits afterward they that are christs at his coming 1524 then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to god even the father when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power 1525 for he must reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet 1526 the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death 1527 for he hath put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is manifest that he is excepted which did put all things under him 1528 and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that god may be all in all 1529 else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead if the dead rise not at all why are they then baptized for the dead 1530 and why stand we in jeopardy every hour 1531 i protest by your rejoicing which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily 1532 if after the manner of men i have fought with beasts at ephesus what advantageth it me if the dead rise not let us eat and drink for to morrow we die 1533 be not deceived evil communications corrupt good manners 1534 awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god i speak this to your shame 1535 but some man will say how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come 1536 thou fool that which thou sowest is not quickened except it die 1537 and that which thou sowest thou sowest not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance of wheat or of some other grain 1538 but god giveth it a body as it hath pleased him and to every seed his own body 1539 all flesh is not the same flesh but there is one kind of flesh of men another flesh of beasts another of fishes and another of birds 1540 there are also celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another 1541 there is one glory of the sun and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars for one star differeth from another star in glory 1542 so also is the resurrection of the dead it is sown in corruption it is raised in incorruption 1543 it is sown in dishonour it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power 1544 it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body 1545 and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit 1546 howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual 1547 the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven 1548 as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly 1549 and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heavenly 1550 now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither doth corruption inherit incorruption 1551 behold i shew you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed 1552 in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed 1553 for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality 1554 so when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory 1555 o death where is thy sting o grave where is thy victory 1556 the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law 1557 but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ 1558 therefore my beloved brethren be ye stedfast unmoveable always abounding in the work of the lord forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the lord 161 now concerning the collection for the saints as i have given order to the churches of galatia even so do ye 162 upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as god hath prospered him that there be no gatherings when i come 163 and when i come whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters them will i send to bring your liberality unto jerusalem 164 and if it be meet that i go also they shall go with me 165 now i will come unto you when i shall pass through macedonia for i do pass through macedonia 166 and it may be that i will abide yea and winter with you that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever i go 167 for i will not see you now by the way but i trust to tarry a while with you if the lord permit 168 but i will tarry at ephesus until pentecost 169 for a great door and effectual is opened unto me and there are many adversaries 1610 now if timotheus come see that he may be with you without fear for he worketh the work of the lord as i also do 1611 let no man therefore despise him but conduct him forth in peace that he may come unto me for i look for him with the brethren 1612 as touching our brother apollos i greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren but his will was not at all to come at this time but he will come when he shall have convenient time 1613 watch ye stand fast in the faith quit you like men be strong 1614 let all your things be done with charity 1615 i beseech you brethren ye know the house of stephanas that it is the firstfruits of achaia and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints 1616 that ye submit yourselves unto such and to every one that helpeth with us and laboureth 1617 i am glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and achaicus for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied 1618 for they have refreshed my spirit and yours therefore acknowledge ye them that are such 1619 the churches of asia salute you aquila and priscilla salute you much in the lord with the church that is in their house 1620 all the brethren greet you greet ye one another with an holy kiss 1621 the salutation of me paul with mine own hand 1622 if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him be anathema maranatha 1623 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you 1624 my love be with you all in christ jesus amen the second epistle of paul the apostle to the corinthians 11 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timothy our brother unto the church of god which is at corinth with all the saints which are in all achaia 12 grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ 13 blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort 14 who comforteth us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god 15 for as the sufferings of christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by christ 16 and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation 17 and our hope of you is stedfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the sufferings so shall ye be also of the consolation 18 for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength insomuch that we despaired even of life 19 but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raiseth the dead 110 who delivered us from so great a death and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us 111 ye also helping together by prayer for us that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf 112 for our rejoicing is this the testimony of our conscience that in simplicity and godly sincerity not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of god we have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly to youward 113 for we write none other things unto you than what ye read or acknowledge and i trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end 114 as also ye have acknowledged us in part that we are your rejoicing even as ye also are ours in the day of the lord jesus 115 and in this confidence i was minded to come unto you before that ye might have a second benefit 116 and to pass by you into macedonia and to come again out of macedonia unto you and of you to be brought on my way toward judaea 117 when i therefore was thus minded did i use lightness or the things that i purpose do i purpose according to the flesh that with me there should be yea yea and nay nay 118 but as god is true our word toward you was not yea and nay 119 for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you by us even by me and silvanus and timotheus was not yea and nay but in him was yea 120 for all the promises of god in him are yea and in him amen unto the glory of god by us 121 now he which stablisheth us with you in christ and hath anointed us is god 122 who hath also sealed us and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts 123 moreover i call god for a record upon my soul that to spare you i came not as yet unto corinth 124 not for that we have dominion over your faith but are helpers of your joy for by faith ye stand 21 but i determined this with myself that i would not come again to you in heaviness 22 for if i make you sorry who is he then that maketh me glad but the same which is made sorry by me 23 and i wrote this same unto you lest when i came i should have sorrow from them of whom i ought to rejoice having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all 24 for out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote unto you with many tears not that ye should be grieved but that ye might know the love which i have more abundantly unto you 25 but if any have caused grief he hath not grieved me but in part that i may not overcharge you all 26 sufficient to such a man is this punishment which was inflicted of many 27 so that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow 28 wherefore i beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him 29 for to this end also did i write that i might know the proof of you whether ye be obedient in all things 210 to whom ye forgive any thing i forgive also for if i forgave any thing to whom i forgave it for your sakes forgave i it in the person of christ 211 lest satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices 212 furthermore when i came to troas to preach christs gospel and a door was opened unto me of the lord 213 i had no rest in my spirit because i found not titus my brother but taking my leave of them i went from thence into macedonia 214 now thanks be unto god which always causeth us to triumph in christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place 215 for we are unto god a sweet savour of christ in them that are saved and in them that perish 216 to the one we are the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life and who is sufficient for these things 217 for we are not as many which corrupt the word of god but as of sincerity but as of god in the sight of god speak we in christ 31 do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you 32 ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men 33 forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshy tables of the heart 34 and such trust have we through christ to godward 35 not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god 36 who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life 37 but if the ministration of death written and engraven in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not stedfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away 38 how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious 39 for if the ministration of condemnation be glory much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory 310 for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth 311 for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious 312 seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech 313 and not as moses which put a vail over his face that the children of israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished 314 but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament which vail is done away in christ 315 but even unto this day when moses is read the vail is upon their heart 316 nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the vail shall be taken away 317 now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty 318 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord 41 therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not 42 but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god 43 but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost 44 in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them 45 for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake 46 for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ 47 but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us 48 we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair 49 persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed 410 always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body 411 for we which live are alway delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh 412 so then death worketh in us but life in you 413 we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak 414 knowing that he which raised up the lord jesus shall raise up us also by jesus and shall present us with you 415 for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of god 416 for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day 417 for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory 418 while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal 51 for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens 52 for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven 53 if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked 54 for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life 55 now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is god who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit 56 therefore we are always confident knowing that whilst we are at home in the body we are absent from the lord 57 for we walk by faith not by sight 58 we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the lord 59 wherefore we labour that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him 510 for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad 511 knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto god and i trust also are made manifest in your consciences 512 for we commend not ourselves again unto you but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance and not in heart 513 for whether we be beside ourselves it is to god or whether we be sober it is for your cause 514 for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then were all dead 515 and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again 516 wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more 517 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new 518 and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation 519 to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation 520 now then we are ambassadors for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christs stead be ye reconciled to god 521 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him 61 we then as workers together with him beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of god in vain 62 for he saith i have heard thee in a time accepted and in the day of salvation have i succoured thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation 63 giving no offence in any thing that the ministry be not blamed 64 but in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of god in much patience in afflictions in necessities in distresses 65 in stripes in imprisonments in tumults in labours in watchings in fastings 66 by pureness by knowledge by longsuffering by kindness by the holy ghost by love unfeigned 67 by the word of truth by the power of god by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left 68 by honour and dishonour by evil report and good report as deceivers and yet true 69 as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chastened and not killed 610 as sorrowful yet alway rejoicing as poor yet making many rich as having nothing and yet possessing all things 611 o ye corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged 612 ye are not straitened in us but ye are straitened in your own bowels 613 now for a recompence in the same i speak as unto my children be ye also enlarged 614 be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness 615 and what concord hath christ with belial or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel 616 and what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people 617 wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you 618 and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty 71 having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god 72 receive us we have wronged no man we have corrupted no man we have defrauded no man 73 i speak not this to condemn you for i have said before that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you 74 great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying of you i am filled with comfort i am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation 75 for when we were come into macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without were fightings within were fears 76 nevertheless god that comforteth those that are cast down comforted us by the coming of titus 77 and not by his coming only but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire your mourning your fervent mind toward me so that i rejoiced the more 78 for though i made you sorry with a letter i do not repent though i did repent for i perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry though it were but for a season 79 now i rejoice not that ye were made sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance for ye were made sorry after a godly manner that ye might receive damage by us in nothing 710 for godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of but the sorrow of the world worketh death 711 for behold this selfsame thing that ye sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yea what clearing of yourselves yea what indignation yea what fear yea what vehement desire yea what zeal yea what revenge in all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter 712 wherefore though i wrote unto you i did it not for his cause that had done the wrong nor for his cause that suffered wrong but that our care for you in the sight of god might appear unto you 713 therefore we were comforted in your comfort yea and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of titus because his spirit was refreshed by you all 714 for if i have boasted any thing to him of you i am not ashamed but as we spake all things to you in truth even so our boasting which i made before titus is found a truth 715 and his inward affection is more abundant toward you whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all how with fear and trembling ye received him 716 i rejoice therefore that i have confidence in you in all things 81 moreover brethren we do you to wit of the grace of god bestowed on the churches of macedonia 82 how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality 83 for to their power i bear record yea and beyond their power they were willing of themselves 84 praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints 85 and this they did not as we hoped but first gave their own selves to the lord and unto us by the will of god 86 insomuch that we desired titus that as he had begun so he would also finish in you the same grace also 87 therefore as ye abound in every thing in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that ye abound in this grace also 88 i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love 89 for ye know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be rich 810 and herein i give my advice for this is expedient for you who have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago 811 now therefore perform the doing of it that as there was a readiness to will so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have 812 for if there be first a willing mind it is accepted according to that a man hath and not according to that he hath not 813 for i mean not that other men be eased and ye burdened 814 but by an equality that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want that their abundance also may be a supply for your want that there may be equality 815 as it is written he that had gathered much had nothing over and he that had gathered little had no lack 816 but thanks be to god which put the same earnest care into the heart of titus for you 817 for indeed he accepted the exhortation but being more forward of his own accord he went unto you 818 and we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches 819 and not that only but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace which is administered by us to the glory of the same lord and declaration of your ready mind 820 avoiding this that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us 821 providing for honest things not only in the sight of the lord but also in the sight of men 822 and we have sent with them our brother whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things but now much more diligent upon the great confidence which i have in you 823 whether any do enquire of titus he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you or our brethren be enquired of they are the messengers of the churches and the glory of christ 824 wherefore shew ye to them and before the churches the proof of your love and of our boasting on your behalf 91 for as touching the ministering to the saints it is superfluous for me to write to you 92 for i know the forwardness of your mind for which i boast of you to them of macedonia that achaia was ready a year ago and your zeal hath provoked very many 93 yet have i sent the brethren lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf that as i said ye may be ready 94 lest haply if they of macedonia come with me and find you unprepared we that we say not ye should be ashamed in this same confident boasting 95 therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they would go before unto you and make up beforehand your bounty whereof ye had notice before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty and not as of covetousness 96 but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully 97 every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth a cheerful giver 98 and god is able to make all grace abound toward you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work 99 as it is written he hath dispersed abroad he hath given to the poor his righteousness remaineth for ever 910 now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food and multiply your seed sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness 911 being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness which causeth through us thanksgiving to god 912 for the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto god 913 whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify god for your professed subjection unto the gospel of christ and for your liberal distribution unto them and unto all men 914 and by their prayer for you which long after you for the exceeding grace of god in you 915 thanks be unto god for his unspeakable gift 101 now i paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in presence am base among you but being absent am bold toward you 102 but i beseech you that i may not be bold when i am present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh 103 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh 104 for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds 105 casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ 106 and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled 107 do ye look on things after the outward appearance if any man trust to himself that he is christs let him of himself think this again that as he is christs even so are we christs 108 for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority which the lord hath given us for edification and not for your destruction i should not be ashamed 109 that i may not seem as if i would terrify you by letters 1010 for his letters say they are weighty and powerful but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible 1011 let such an one think this that such as we are in word by letters when we are absent such will we be also in deed when we are present 1012 for we dare not make ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise 1013 but we will not boast of things without our measure but according to the measure of the rule which god hath distributed to us a measure to reach even unto you 1014 for we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure as though we reached not unto you for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of christ 1015 not boasting of things without our measure that is of other mens labours but having hope when your faith is increased that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly 1016 to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you and not to boast in another mans line of things made ready to our hand 1017 but he that glorieth let him glory in the lord 1018 for not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom the lord commendeth 111 would to god ye could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me 112 for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ 113 but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtilty so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in christ 114 for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit which ye have not received or another gospel which ye have not accepted ye might well bear with him 115 for i suppose i was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles 116 but though i be rude in speech yet not in knowledge but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things 117 have i committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted because i have preached to you the gospel of god freely 118 i robbed other churches taking wages of them to do you service 119 and when i was present with you and wanted i was chargeable to no man for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from macedonia supplied and in all things i have kept myself from being burdensome unto you and so will i keep myself 1110 as the truth of christ is in me no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of achaia 1111 wherefore because i love you not god knoweth 1112 but what i do that i will do that i may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that wherein they glory they may be found even as we 1113 for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ 1114 and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light 1115 therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works 1116 i say again let no man think me a fool if otherwise yet as a fool receive me that i may boast myself a little 1117 that which i speak i speak it not after the lord but as it were foolishly in this confidence of boasting 1118 seeing that many glory after the flesh i will glory also 1119 for ye suffer fools gladly seeing ye yourselves are wise 1120 for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage if a man devour you if a man take of you if a man exalt himself if a man smite you on the face 1121 i speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak howbeit whereinsoever any is bold i speak foolishly i am bold also 1122 are they hebrews so am i are they israelites so am i are they the seed of abraham so am i 1123 are they ministers of christ i speak as a fool i am more in labours more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths oft 1124 of the jews five times received i forty stripes save one 1125 thrice was i beaten with rods once was i stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a night and a day i have been in the deep 1126 in journeyings often in perils of waters in perils of robbers in perils by mine own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren 1127 in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fastings often in cold and nakedness 1128 beside those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches 1129 who is weak and i am not weak who is offended and i burn not 1130 if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities 1131 the god and father of our lord jesus christ which is blessed for evermore knoweth that i lie not 1132 in damascus the governor under aretas the king kept the city of the damascenes with a garrison desirous to apprehend me 1133 and through a window in a basket was i let down by the wall and escaped his hands 121 it is not expedient for me doubtless to glory i will come to visions and revelations of the lord 122 i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth such an one caught up to the third heaven 123 and i knew such a man whether in the body or out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth 124 how that he was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter 125 of such an one will i glory yet of myself i will not glory but in mine infirmities 126 for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool for i will say the truth but now i forbear lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be or that he heareth of me 127 and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure 128 for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me 129 and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me 1210 therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches in necessities in persecutions in distresses for christs sake for when i am weak then am i strong 1211 i am become a fool in glorying ye have compelled me for i ought to have been commended of you for in nothing am i behind the very chiefest apostles though i be nothing 1212 truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds 1213 for what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches except it be that i myself was not burdensome to you forgive me this wrong 1214 behold the third time i am ready to come to you and i will not be burdensome to you for i seek not yours but you for the children ought not to lay up for the parents but the parents for the children 1215 and i will very gladly spend and be spent for you though the more abundantly i love you the less i be loved 1216 but be it so i did not burden you nevertheless being crafty i caught you with guile 1217 did i make a gain of you by any of them whom i sent unto you 1218 i desired titus and with him i sent a brother did titus make a gain of you walked we not in the same spirit walked we not in the same steps 1219 again think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you we speak before god in christ but we do all things dearly beloved for your edifying 1220 for i fear lest when i come i shall not find you such as i would and that i shall be found unto you such as ye would not lest there be debates envyings wraths strifes backbitings whisperings swellings tumults 1221 and lest when i come again my god will humble me among you and that i shall bewail many which have sinned already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed 131 this is the third time i am coming to you in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established 132 i told you before and foretell you as if i were present the second time and being absent now i write to them which heretofore have sinned and to all other that if i come again i will not spare 133 since ye seek a proof of christ speaking in me which to youward is not weak but is mighty in you 134 for though he was crucified through weakness yet he liveth by the power of god for we also are weak in him but we shall live with him by the power of god toward you 135 examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith prove your own selves know ye not your own selves how that jesus christ is in you except ye be reprobates 136 but i trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates 137 now i pray to god that ye do no evil not that we should appear approved but that ye should do that which is honest though we be as reprobates 138 for we can do nothing against the truth but for the truth 139 for we are glad when we are weak and ye are strong and this also we wish even your perfection 1310 therefore i write these things being absent lest being present i should use sharpness according to the power which the lord hath given me to edification and not to destruction 1311 finally brethren farewell be perfect be of good comfort be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace shall be with you 1312 greet one another with an holy kiss 1313 all the saints salute you 1314 the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost be with you all amen the epistle of paul the apostle to the galatians 11 paul an apostle not of men neither by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead 12 and all the brethren which are with me unto the churches of galatia 13 grace be to you and peace from god the father and from our lord jesus christ 14 who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of god and our father 15 to whom be glory for ever and ever amen 16 i marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of christ unto another gospel 17 which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of christ 18 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed 19 as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be accursed 110 for do i now persuade men or god or do i seek to please men for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ 111 but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man 112 for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ 113 for ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the jews religion how that beyond measure i persecuted the church of god and wasted it 114 and profited in the jews religion above many my equals in mine own nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers 115 but when it pleased god who separated me from my mothers womb and called me by his grace 116 to reveal his son in me that i might preach him among the heathen immediately i conferred not with flesh and blood 117 neither went i up to jerusalem to them which were apostles before me but i went into arabia and returned again unto damascus 118 then after three years i went up to jerusalem to see peter and abode with him fifteen days 119 but other of the apostles saw i none save james the lords brother 120 now the things which i write unto you behold before god i lie not 121 afterwards i came into the regions of syria and cilicia 122 and was unknown by face unto the churches of judaea which were in christ 123 but they had heard only that he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed 124 and they glorified god in me 21 then fourteen years after i went up again to jerusalem with barnabas and took titus with me also 22 and i went up by revelation and communicated unto them that gospel which i preach among the gentiles but privately to them which were of reputation lest by any means i should run or had run in vain 23 but neither titus who was with me being a greek was compelled to be circumcised 24 and that because of false brethren unawares brought in who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in christ jesus that they might bring us into bondage 25 to whom we gave place by subjection no not for an hour that the truth of the gospel might continue with you 26 but of these who seemed to be somewhat whatsoever they were it maketh no matter to me god accepteth no mans person for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me 27 but contrariwise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter 28 for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles 29 and when james cephas and john who seemed to be pillars perceived the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision 210 only they would that we should remember the poor the same which i also was forward to do 211 but when peter was come to antioch i withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed 212 for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself fearing them which were of the circumcision 213 and the other jews dissembled likewise with him insomuch that barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation 214 but when i saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel i said unto peter before them all if thou being a jew livest after the manner of gentiles and not as do the jews why compellest thou the gentiles to live as do the jews 215 we who are jews by nature and not sinners of the gentiles 216 knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by the faith of jesus christ even we have believed in jesus christ that we might be justified by the faith of christ and not by the works of the law for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified 217 but if while we seek to be justified by christ we ourselves also are found sinners is therefore christ the minister of sin god forbid 218 for if i build again the things which i destroyed i make myself a transgressor 219 for i through the law am dead to the law that i might live unto god 220 i am crucified with christ neverthless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me 221 i do not frustrate the grace of god for if righteousness come by the law then christ is dead in vain 31 o foolish galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you 32 this only would i learn of you received ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith 33 are ye so foolish having begun in the spirit are ye now made perfect by the flesh 34 have ye suffered so many things in vain if it be yet in vain 35 he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith 36 even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness 37 know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham 38 and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed 39 so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham 310 for as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them 311 but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god it is evident for the just shall live by faith 312 and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them 313 christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree 314 that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith 315 brethren i speak after the manner of men though it be but a mans covenant yet if it be confirmed no man disannulleth or addeth thereto 316 now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is christ 317 and this i say that the covenant that was confirmed before of god in christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot disannul that it should make the promise of none effect 318 for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more of promise but god gave it to abraham by promise 319 wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator 320 now a mediator is not a mediator of one but god is one 321 is the law then against the promises of god god forbid for if there had been a law given which could have given life verily righteousness should have been by the law 322 but the scripture hath concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of jesus christ might be given to them that believe 323 but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed 324 wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto christ that we might be justified by faith 325 but after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster 326 for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus 327 for as many of you as have been baptized into christ have put on christ 328 there is neither jew nor greek there is neither bond nor free there is neither male nor female for ye are all one in christ jesus 329 and if ye be christs then are ye abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise 41 now i say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be lord of all 42 but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father 43 even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world 44 but when the fulness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law 45 to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons 46 and because ye are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father 47 wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ 48 howbeit then when ye knew not god ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods 49 but now after that ye have known god or rather are known of god how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage 410 ye observe days and months and times and years 411 i am afraid of you lest i have bestowed upon you labour in vain 412 brethren i beseech you be as i am for i am as ye are ye have not injured me at all 413 ye know how through infirmity of the flesh i preached the gospel unto you at the first 414 and my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not nor rejected but received me as an angel of god even as christ jesus 415 where is then the blessedness ye spake of for i bear you record that if it had been possible ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me 416 am i therefore become your enemy because i tell you the truth 417 they zealously affect you but not well yea they would exclude you that ye might affect them 418 but it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing and not only when i am present with you 419 my little children of whom i travail in birth again until christ be formed in you 420 i desire to be present with you now and to change my voice for i stand in doubt of you 421 tell me ye that desire to be under the law do ye not hear the law 422 for it is written that abraham had two sons the one by a bondmaid the other by a freewoman 423 but he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh but he of the freewoman was by promise 424 which things are an allegory for these are the two covenants the one from the mount sinai which gendereth to bondage which is agar 425 for this agar is mount sinai in arabia and answereth to jerusalem which now is and is in bondage with her children 426 but jerusalem which is above is free which is the mother of us all 427 for it is written rejoice thou barren that bearest not break forth and cry thou that travailest not for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband 428 now we brethren as isaac was are the children of promise 429 but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now 430 nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman 431 so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free 51 stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith christ hath made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage 52 behold i paul say unto you that if ye be circumcised christ shall profit you nothing 53 for i testify again to every man that is circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law 54 christ is become of no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law ye are fallen from grace 55 for we through the spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith 56 for in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love 57 ye did run well who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth 58 this persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you 59 a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump 510 i have confidence in you through the lord that ye will be none otherwise minded but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment whosoever he be 511 and i brethren if i yet preach circumcision why do i yet suffer persecution then is the offence of the cross ceased 512 i would they were even cut off which trouble you 513 for brethren ye have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another 514 for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself 515 but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another 516 this i say then walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh 517 for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that ye cannot do the things that ye would 518 but if ye be led of the spirit ye are not under the law 519 now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness lasciviousness 520 idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations wrath strife seditions heresies 521 envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god 522 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith 523 meekness temperance against such there is no law 524 and they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts 525 if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit 526 let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another envying one another 61 brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted 62 bear ye one anothers burdens and so fulfil the law of christ 63 for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself 64 but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another 65 for every man shall bear his own burden 66 let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things 67 be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap 68 for he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life everlasting 69 and let us not be weary in well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not 610 as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith 611 ye see how large a letter i have written unto you with mine own hand 612 as many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of christ 613 for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh 614 but god forbid that i should glory save in the cross of our lord jesus christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and i unto the world 615 for in christ jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor uncircumcision but a new creature 616 and as many as walk according to this rule peace be on them and mercy and upon the israel of god 617 from henceforth let no man trouble me for i bear in my body the marks of the lord jesus 618 brethren the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit amen the epistle of paul the apostle to the ephesians 11 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god to the saints which are at ephesus and to the faithful in christ jesus 12 grace be to you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ 13 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ 14 according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love 15 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will 16 to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved 17 in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace 18 wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence 19 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself 110 that in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him 111 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will 112 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ 113 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise 114 which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory 115 wherefore i also after i heard of your faith in the lord jesus and love unto all the saints 116 cease not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayers 117 that the god of our lord jesus christ the father of glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him 118 the eyes of your understanding being enlightened that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints 119 and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usward who believe according to the working of his mighty power 120 which he wrought in christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places 121 far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come 122 and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the church 123 which is his body the fulness of him that filleth all in all 21 and you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins 22 wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience 23 among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others 24 but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us 25 even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved 26 and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus 27 that in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through christ jesus 28 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god 29 not of works lest any man should boast 210 for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them 211 wherefore remember that ye being in time past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands 212 that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world 213 but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ 214 for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us 215 having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace 216 and that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby 217 and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nigh 218 for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father 219 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of god 220 and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone 221 in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the lord 222 in whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of god through the spirit 31 for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles 32 if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which is given me to youward 33 how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote afore in few words 34 whereby when ye read ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ 35 which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit 36 that the gentiles should be fellowheirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel 37 whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power 38 unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ 39 and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ 310 to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god 311 according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord 312 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him 313 wherefore i desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory 314 for this cause i bow my knees unto the father of our lord jesus christ 315 of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named 316 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man 317 that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love 318 may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height 319 and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fulness of god 320 now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us 321 unto him be glory in the church by christ jesus throughout all ages world without end amen 41 i therefore the prisoner of the lord beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called 42 with all lowliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love 43 endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace 44 there is one body and one spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling 45 one lord one faith one baptism 46 one god and father of all who is above all and through all and in you all 47 but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of christ 48 wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men 49 now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth 410 he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things 411 and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers 412 for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of christ 413 till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ 414 that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive 415 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ 416 from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love 417 this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind 418 having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart 419 who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness 420 but ye have not so learned christ 421 if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in jesus 422 that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts 423 and be renewed in the spirit of your mind 424 and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness 425 wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbour for we are members one of another 426 be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath 427 neither give place to the devil 428 let him that stole steal no more but rather let him labour working with his hands the thing which is good that he may have to give to him that needeth 429 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers 430 and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption 431 let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice 432 and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christs sake hath forgiven you 51 be ye therefore followers of god as dear children 52 and walk in love as christ also hath loved us and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to god for a sweetsmelling savour 53 but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it not be once named among you as becometh saints 54 neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks 55 for this ye know that no whoremonger nor unclean person nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god 56 let no man deceive you with vain words for because of these things cometh the wrath of god upon the children of disobedience 57 be not ye therefore partakers with them 58 for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the lord walk as children of light 59 for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth 510 proving what is acceptable unto the lord 511 and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them 512 for it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret 513 but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light for whatsoever doth make manifest is light 514 wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and christ shall give thee light 515 see then that ye walk circumspectly not as fools but as wise 516 redeeming the time because the days are evil 517 wherefore be ye not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is 518 and be not drunk with wine wherein is excess but be filled with the spirit 519 speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your heart to the lord 520 giving thanks always for all things unto god and the father in the name of our lord jesus christ 521 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god 522 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord 523 for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the saviour of the body 524 therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing 525 husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it 526 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word 527 that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish 528 so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself 529 for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the lord the church 530 for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones 531 for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they two shall be one flesh 532 this is a great mystery but i speak concerning christ and the church 533 nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband 61 children obey your parents in the lord for this is right 62 honour thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise 63 that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth 64 and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord 65 servants be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as unto christ 66 not with eyeservice as menpleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart 67 with good will doing service as to the lord and not to men 68 knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth the same shall he receive of the lord whether he be bond or free 69 and ye masters do the same things unto them forbearing threatening knowing that your master also is in heaven neither is there respect of persons with him 610 finally my brethren be strong in the lord and in the power of his might 611 put on the whole armour of god that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil 612 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places 613 wherefore take unto you the whole armour of god that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand 614 stand therefore having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness 615 and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace 616 above all taking the shield of faith wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked 617 and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god 618 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints 619 and for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel 620 for which i am an ambassador in bonds that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to speak 621 but that ye also may know my affairs and how i do tychicus a beloved brother and faithful minister in the lord shall make known to you all things 622 whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that ye might know our affairs and that he might comfort your hearts 623 peace be to the brethren and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ 624 grace be with all them that love our lord jesus christ in sincerity amen the epistle of paul the apostle to the philippians 11 paul and timotheus the servants of jesus christ to all the saints in christ jesus which are at philippi with the bishops and deacons 12 grace be unto you and peace from god our father and from the lord jesus christ 13 i thank my god upon every remembrance of you 14 always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy 15 for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now 16 being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of jesus christ 17 even as it is meet for me to think this of you all because i have you in my heart inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel ye all are partakers of my grace 18 for god is my record how greatly i long after you all in the bowels of jesus christ 19 and this i pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment 110 that ye may approve things that are excellent that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of christ 111 being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by jesus christ unto the glory and praise of god 112 but i would ye should understand brethren that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel 113 so that my bonds in christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places 114 and many of the brethren in the lord waxing confident by my bonds are much more bold to speak the word without fear 115 some indeed preach christ even of envy and strife and some also of good will 116 the one preach christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my bonds 117 but the other of love knowing that i am set for the defence of the gospel 118 what then notwithstanding every way whether in pretence or in truth christ is preached and i therein do rejoice yea and will rejoice 119 for i know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and the supply of the spirit of jesus christ 120 according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing i shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death 121 for to me to live is christ and to die is gain 122 but if i live in the flesh this is the fruit of my labour yet what i shall choose i wot not 123 for i am in a strait betwixt two having a desire to depart and to be with christ which is far better 124 nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you 125 and having this confidence i know that i shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith 126 that your rejoicing may be more abundant in jesus christ for me by my coming to you again 127 only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of christ that whether i come and see you or else be absent i may hear of your affairs that ye stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel 128 and in nothing terrified by your adversaries which is to them an evident token of perdition but to you of salvation and that of god 129 for unto you it is given in the behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for his sake 130 having the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me 21 if there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies 22 fulfil ye my joy that ye be likeminded having the same love being of one accord of one mind 23 let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves 24 look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others 25 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus 26 who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god 27 but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men 28 and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross 29 wherefore god also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name 210 that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth 211 and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father 212 wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling 213 for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure 214 do all things without murmurings and disputings 215 that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of god without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom ye shine as lights in the world 216 holding forth the word of life that i may rejoice in the day of christ that i have not run in vain neither laboured in vain 217 yea and if i be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith i joy and rejoice with you all 218 for the same cause also do ye joy and rejoice with me 219 but i trust in the lord jesus to send timotheus shortly unto you that i also may be of good comfort when i know your state 220 for i have no man likeminded who will naturally care for your state 221 for all seek their own not the things which are jesus christs 222 but ye know the proof of him that as a son with the father he hath served with me in the gospel 223 him therefore i hope to send presently so soon as i shall see how it will go with me 224 but i trust in the lord that i also myself shall come shortly 225 yet i supposed it necessary to send to you epaphroditus my brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier but your messenger and he that ministered to my wants 226 for he longed after you all and was full of heaviness because that ye had heard that he had been sick 227 for indeed he was sick nigh unto death but god had mercy on him and not on him only but on me also lest i should have sorrow upon sorrow 228 i sent him therefore the more carefully that when ye see him again ye may rejoice and that i may be the less sorrowful 229 receive him therefore in the lord with all gladness and hold such in reputation 230 because for the work of christ he was nigh unto death not regarding his life to supply your lack of service toward me 31 finally my brethren rejoice in the lord to write the same things to you to me indeed is not grievous but for you it is safe 32 beware of dogs beware of evil workers beware of the concision 33 for we are the circumcision which worship god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh 34 though i might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh i more 35 circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel of the tribe of benjamin an hebrew of the hebrews as touching the law a pharisee 36 concerning zeal persecuting the church touching the righteousness which is in the law blameless 37 but what things were gain to me those i counted loss for christ 38 yea doubtless and i count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that i may win christ 39 and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith 310 that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death 311 if by any means i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead 312 not as though i had already attained either were already perfect but i follow after if that i may apprehend that for which also i am apprehended of christ jesus 313 brethren i count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing i do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before 314 i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus 315 let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you 316 nevertheless whereto we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing 317 brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample 318 for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping that they are the enemies of the cross of christ 319 whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things 320 for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the saviour the lord jesus christ 321 who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself 41 therefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for my joy and crown so stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved 42 i beseech euodias and beseech syntyche that they be of the same mind in the lord 43 and i intreat thee also true yokefellow help those women which laboured with me in the gospel with clement also and with other my fellowlabourers whose names are in the book of life 44 rejoice in the lord alway and again i say rejoice 45 let your moderation be known unto all men the lord is at hand 46 be careful for nothing but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god 47 and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus 48 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things 49 those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you 410 but i rejoiced in the lord greatly that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again wherein ye were also careful but ye lacked opportunity 411 not that i speak in respect of want for i have learned in whatsoever state i am therewith to be content 412 i know both how to be abased and i know how to abound every where and in all things i am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need 413 i can do all things through christ which strengtheneth me 414 notwithstanding ye have well done that ye did communicate with my affliction 415 now ye philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when i departed from macedonia no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving but ye only 416 for even in thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity 417 not because i desire a gift but i desire fruit that may abound to your account 418 but i have all and abound i am full having received of epaphroditus the things which were sent from you an odour of a sweet smell a sacrifice acceptable wellpleasing to god 419 but my god shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by christ jesus 420 now unto god and our father be glory for ever and ever amen 421 salute every saint in christ jesus the brethren which are with me greet you 422 all the saints salute you chiefly they that are of caesars household 423 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen the epistle of paul the apostle to the colossians 11 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timotheus our brother 12 to the saints and faithful brethren in christ which are at colosse grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ 13 we give thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying always for you 14 since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which ye have to all the saints 15 for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel 16 which is come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it doth also in you since the day ye heard of it and knew the grace of god in truth 17 as ye also learned of epaphras our dear fellowservant who is for you a faithful minister of christ 18 who also declared unto us your love in the spirit 19 for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding 110 that ye might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god 111 strengthened with all might according to his glorious power unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness 112 giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light 113 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son 114 in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins 115 who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature 116 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him 117 and he is before all things and by him all things consist 118 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence 119 for it pleased the father that in him should all fulness dwell 120 and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him i say whether they be things in earth or things in heaven 121 and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled 122 in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight 123 if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul am made a minister 124 who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his bodys sake which is the church 125 whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfil the word of god 126 even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints 127 to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory 128 whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus 129 whereunto i also labour striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily 21 for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh 22 that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ 23 in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge 24 and this i say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words 25 for though i be absent in the flesh yet am i with you in the spirit joying and beholding your order and the stedfastness of your faith in christ 26 as ye have therefore received christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him 27 rooted and built up in him and stablished in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving 28 beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ 29 for in him dwelleth all the fulness of the godhead bodily 210 and ye are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power 211 in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of christ 212 buried with him in baptism wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead 213 and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses 214 blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross 215 and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a shew of them openly triumphing over them in it 216 let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holyday or of the new moon or of the sabbath days 217 which are a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ 218 let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels intruding into those things which he hath not seen vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind 219 and not holding the head from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increaseth with the increase of god 220 wherefore if ye be dead with christ from the rudiments of the world why as though living in the world are ye subject to ordinances 221 touch not taste not handle not 222 which all are to perish with the using after the commandments and doctrines of men 223 which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship and humility and neglecting of the body not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh 31 if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god 32 set your affection on things above not on things on the earth 33 for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god 34 when christ who is our life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory 35 mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetousness which is idolatry 36 for which things sake the wrath of god cometh on the children of disobedience 37 in the which ye also walked some time when ye lived in them 38 but now ye also put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth 39 lie not one to another seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds 310 and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him 311 where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian scythian bond nor free but christ is all and in all 312 put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness longsuffering 313 forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do ye 314 and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness 315 and let the peace of god rule in your hearts to the which also ye are called in one body and be ye thankful 316 let the word of christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing with grace in your hearts to the lord 317 and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god and the father by him 318 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as it is fit in the lord 319 husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them 320 children obey your parents in all things for this is well pleasing unto the lord 321 fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged 322 servants obey in all things your masters according to the flesh not with eyeservice as menpleasers but in singleness of heart fearing god 323 and whatsoever ye do do it heartily as to the lord and not unto men 324 knowing that of the lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance for ye serve the lord christ 325 but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done and there is no respect of persons 41 masters give unto your servants that which is just and equal knowing that ye also have a master in heaven 42 continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving 43 withal praying also for us that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ for which i am also in bonds 44 that i may make it manifest as i ought to speak 45 walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time 46 let your speech be alway with grace seasoned with salt that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man 47 all my state shall tychicus declare unto you who is a beloved brother and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the lord 48 whom i have sent unto you for the same purpose that he might know your estate and comfort your hearts 49 with onesimus a faithful and beloved brother who is one of you they shall make known unto you all things which are done here 410 aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you and marcus sisters son to barnabas touching whom ye received commandments if he come unto you receive him 411 and jesus which is called justus who are of the circumcision these only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of god which have been a comfort unto me 412 epaphras who is one of you a servant of christ saluteth you always labouring fervently for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of god 413 for i bear him record that he hath a great zeal for you and them that are in laodicea and them in hierapolis 414 luke the beloved physician and demas greet you 415 salute the brethren which are in laodicea and nymphas and the church which is in his house 416 and when this epistle is read among you cause that it be read also in the church of the laodiceans and that ye likewise read the epistle from laodicea 417 and say to archippus take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the lord that thou fulfil it 418 the salutation by the hand of me paul remember my bonds grace be with you amen the first epistle of paul the apostle to the thessalonians 11 paul and silvanus and timotheus unto the church of the thessalonians which is in god the father and in the lord jesus christ grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ 12 we give thanks to god always for you all making mention of you in our prayers 13 remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope in our lord jesus christ in the sight of god and our father 14 knowing brethren beloved your election of god 15 for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake 16 and ye became followers of us and of the lord having received the word in much affliction with joy of the holy ghost 17 so that ye were ensamples to all that believe in macedonia and achaia 18 for from you sounded out the word of the lord not only in macedonia and achaia but also in every place your faith to godward is spread abroad so that we need not to speak any thing 19 for they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you and how ye turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god 110 and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come 21 for yourselves brethren know our entrance in unto you that it was not in vain 22 but even after that we had suffered before and were shamefully entreated as ye know at philippi we were bold in our god to speak unto you the gospel of god with much contention 23 for our exhortation was not of deceit nor of uncleanness nor in guile 24 but as we were allowed of god to be put in trust with the gospel even so we speak not as pleasing men but god which trieth our hearts 25 for neither at any time used we flattering words as ye know nor a cloke of covetousness god is witness 26 nor of men sought we glory neither of you nor yet of others when we might have been burdensome as the apostles of christ 27 but we were gentle among you even as a nurse cherisheth her children 28 so being affectionately desirous of you we were willing to have imparted unto you not the gospel of god only but also our own souls because ye were dear unto us 29 for ye remember brethren our labour and travail for labouring night and day because we would not be chargeable unto any of you we preached unto you the gospel of god 210 ye are witnesses and god also how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe 211 as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father doth his children 212 that ye would walk worthy of god who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory 213 for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when ye received the word of god which ye heard of us ye received it not as the word of men but as it is in truth the word of god which effectually worketh also in you that believe 214 for ye brethren became followers of the churches of god which in judaea are in christ jesus for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen even as they have of the jews 215 who both killed the lord jesus and their own prophets and have persecuted us and they please not god and are contrary to all men 216 forbidding us to speak to the gentiles that they might be saved to fill up their sins alway for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost 217 but we brethren being taken from you for a short time in presence not in heart endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire 218 wherefore we would have come unto you even i paul once and again but satan hindered us 219 for what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing are not even ye in the presence of our lord jesus christ at his coming 220 for ye are our glory and joy 31 wherefore when we could no longer forbear we thought it good to be left at athens alone 32 and sent timotheus our brother and minister of god and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of christ to establish you and to comfort you concerning your faith 33 that no man should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto 34 for verily when we were with you we told you before that we should suffer tribulation even as it came to pass and ye know 35 for this cause when i could no longer forbear i sent to know your faith lest by some means the tempter have tempted you and our labour be in vain 36 but now when timotheus came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity and that ye have good remembrance of us always desiring greatly to see us as we also to see you 37 therefore brethren we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith 38 for now we live if ye stand fast in the lord 39 for what thanks can we render to god again for you for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our god 310 night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith 311 now god himself and our father and our lord jesus christ direct our way unto you 312 and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men even as we do toward you 313 to the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god even our father at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints 41 furthermore then we beseech you brethren and exhort you by the lord jesus that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please god so ye would abound more and more 42 for ye know what commandments we gave you by the lord jesus 43 for this is the will of god even your sanctification that ye should abstain from fornication 44 that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour 45 not in the lust of concupiscence even as the gentiles which know not god 46 that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because that the lord is the avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified 47 for god hath not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness 48 he therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but god who hath also given unto us his holy spirit 49 but as touching brotherly love ye need not that i write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another 410 and indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all macedonia but we beseech you brethren that ye increase more and more 411 and that ye study to be quiet and to do your own business and to work with your own hands as we commanded you 412 that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without and that ye may have lack of nothing 413 but i would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope 414 for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him 415 for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep 416 for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first 417 then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord 418 wherefore comfort one another with these words 51 but of the times and the seasons brethren ye have no need that i write unto you 52 for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night 53 for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape 54 but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief 55 ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness 56 therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober 57 for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night 58 but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation 59 for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ 510 who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him 511 wherefore comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do 512 and we beseech you brethren to know them which labour among you and are over you in the lord and admonish you 513 and to esteem them very highly in love for their works sake and be at peace among yourselves 514 now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unruly comfort the feebleminded support the weak be patient toward all men 515 see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men 516 rejoice evermore 517 pray without ceasing 518 in every thing give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you 519 quench not the spirit 520 despise not prophesyings 521 prove all things hold fast that which is good 522 abstain from all appearance of evil 523 and the very god of peace sanctify you wholly and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ 524 faithful is he that calleth you who also will do it 525 brethren pray for us 526 greet all the brethren with an holy kiss 527 i charge you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren 528 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you amen the second epistle of paul the apostle to the thessalonians 11 paul and silvanus and timotheus unto the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ 12 grace unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ 13 we are bound to thank god always for you brethren as it is meet because that your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth 14 so that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of god for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure 15 which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of god that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of god for which ye also suffer 16 seeing it is a righteous thing with god to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you 17 and to you who are troubled rest with us when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels 18 in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ 19 who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power 110 when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day 111 wherefore also we pray always for you that our god would count you worthy of this calling and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness and the work of faith with power 112 that the name of our lord jesus christ may be glorified in you and ye in him according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ 21 now we beseech you brethren by the coming of our lord jesus christ and by our gathering together unto him 22 that ye be not soon shaken in mind or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of christ is at hand 23 let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of perdition 24 who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he as god sitteth in the temple of god shewing himself that he is god 25 remember ye not that when i was yet with you i told you these things 26 and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time 27 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let until he be taken out of the way 28 and then shall that wicked be revealed whom the lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming 29 even him whose coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders 210 and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth that they might be saved 211 and for this cause god shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie 212 that they all might be damned who believed not the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness 213 but we are bound to give thanks alway to god for you brethren beloved of the lord because god hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth 214 whereunto he called you by our gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our lord jesus christ 215 therefore brethren stand fast and hold the traditions which ye have been taught whether by word or our epistle 216 now our lord jesus christ himself and god even our father which hath loved us and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace 217 comfort your hearts and stablish you in every good word and work 31 finally brethren pray for us that the word of the lord may have free course and be glorified even as it is with you 32 and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men for all men have not faith 33 but the lord is faithful who shall stablish you and keep you from evil 34 and we have confidence in the lord touching you that ye both do and will do the things which we command you 35 and the lord direct your hearts into the love of god and into the patient waiting for christ 36 now we command you brethren in the name of our lord jesus christ that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly and not after the tradition which he received of us 37 for yourselves know how ye ought to follow us for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you 38 neither did we eat any mans bread for nought but wrought with labour and travail night and day that we might not be chargeable to any of you 39 not because we have not power but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us 310 for even when we were with you this we commanded you that if any would not work neither should he eat 311 for we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly working not at all but are busybodies 312 now them that are such we command and exhort by our lord jesus christ that with quietness they work and eat their own bread 313 but ye brethren be not weary in well doing 314 and if any man obey not our word by this epistle note that man and have no company with him that he may be ashamed 315 yet count him not as an enemy but admonish him as a brother 316 now the lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means the lord be with you all 317 the salutation of paul with mine own hand which is the token in every epistle so i write 318 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen the first epistle of paul the apostle to timothy 11 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our saviour and lord jesus christ which is our hope 12 unto timothy my own son in the faith grace mercy and peace from god our father and jesus christ our lord 13 as i besought thee to abide still at ephesus when i went into macedonia that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine 14 neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than godly edifying which is in faith so do 15 now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned 16 from which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling 17 desiring to be teachers of the law understanding neither what they say nor whereof they affirm 18 but we know that the law is good if a man use it lawfully 19 knowing this that the law is not made for a righteous man but for the lawless and disobedient for the ungodly and for sinners for unholy and profane for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers for manslayers 110 for whoremongers for them that defile themselves with mankind for menstealers for liars for perjured persons and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine 111 according to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which was committed to my trust 112 and i thank christ jesus our lord who hath enabled me for that he counted me faithful putting me into the ministry 113 who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious but i obtained mercy because i did it ignorantly in unbelief 114 and the grace of our lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in christ jesus 115 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief 116 howbeit for this cause i obtained mercy that in me first jesus christ might shew forth all longsuffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting 117 now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise god be honour and glory for ever and ever amen 118 this charge i commit unto thee son timothy according to the prophecies which went before on thee that thou by them mightest war a good warfare 119 holding faith and a good conscience which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck 120 of whom is hymenaeus and alexander whom i have delivered unto satan that they may learn not to blaspheme 21 i exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men 22 for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty 23 for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our saviour 24 who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth 25 for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus 26 who gave himself a ransom for all to be testified in due time 27 whereunto i am ordained a preacher and an apostle i speak the truth in christ and lie not a teacher of the gentiles in faith and verity 28 i will therefore that men pray every where lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting 29 in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array 210 but which becometh women professing godliness with good works 211 let the woman learn in silence with all subjection 212 but i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence 213 for adam was first formed then eve 214 and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression 215 notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety 31 this is a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desireth a good work 32 a bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife vigilant sober of good behaviour given to hospitality apt to teach 33 not given to wine no striker not greedy of filthy lucre but patient not a brawler not covetous 34 one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity 35 for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the church of god 36 not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil 37 moreover he must have a good report of them which are without lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil 38 likewise must the deacons be grave not doubletongued not given to much wine not greedy of filthy lucre 39 holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience 310 and let these also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless 311 even so must their wives be grave not slanderers sober faithful in all things 312 let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own houses well 313 for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in christ jesus 314 these things write i unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly 315 but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and ground of the truth 316 and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness god was manifest in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory 41 now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils 42 speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron 43 forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from meats which god hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth 44 for every creature of god is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving 45 for it is sanctified by the word of god and prayer 46 if thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things thou shalt be a good minister of jesus christ nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine whereunto thou hast attained 47 but refuse profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness 48 for bodily exercise profiteth little but godliness is profitable unto all things having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come 49 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation 410 for therefore we both labour and suffer reproach because we trust in the living god who is the saviour of all men specially of those that believe 411 these things command and teach 412 let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity 413 till i come give attendance to reading to exhortation to doctrine 414 neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery 415 meditate upon these things give thyself wholly to them that thy profiting may appear to all 416 take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine continue in them for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee 51 rebuke not an elder but intreat him as a father and the younger men as brethren 52 the elder women as mothers the younger as sisters with all purity 53 honour widows that are widows indeed 54 but if any widow have children or nephews let them learn first to shew piety at home and to requite their parents for that is good and acceptable before god 55 now she that is a widow indeed and desolate trusteth in god and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day 56 but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth 57 and these things give in charge that they may be blameless 58 but if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an infidel 59 let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old having been the wife of one man 510 well reported of for good works if she have brought up children if she have lodged strangers if she have washed the saints feet if she have relieved the afflicted if she have diligently followed every good work 511 but the younger widows refuse for when they have begun to wax wanton against christ they will marry 512 having damnation because they have cast off their first faith 513 and withal they learn to be idle wandering about from house to house and not only idle but tattlers also and busybodies speaking things which they ought not 514 i will therefore that the younger women marry bear children guide the house give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully 515 for some are already turned aside after satan 516 if any man or woman that believeth have widows let them relieve them and let not the church be charged that it may relieve them that are widows indeed 517 let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour especially they who labour in the word and doctrine 518 for the scripture saith thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn and the labourer is worthy of his reward 519 against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or three witnesses 520 them that sin rebuke before all that others also may fear 521 i charge thee before god and the lord jesus christ and the elect angels that thou observe these things without preferring one before another doing nothing by partiality 522 lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other mens sins keep thyself pure 523 drink no longer water but use a little wine for thy stomachs sake and thine often infirmities 524 some mens sins are open beforehand going before to judgment and some men they follow after 525 likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand and they that are otherwise cannot be hid 61 let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour that the name of god and his doctrine be not blasphemed 62 and they that have believing masters let them not despise them because they are brethren but rather do them service because they are faithful and beloved partakers of the benefit these things teach and exhort 63 if any man teach otherwise and consent not to wholesome words even the words of our lord jesus christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness 64 he is proud knowing nothing but doting about questions and strifes of words whereof cometh envy strife railings evil surmisings 65 perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself 66 but godliness with contentment is great gain 67 for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out 68 and having food and raiment let us be therewith content 69 but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition 610 for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows 611 but thou o man of god flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness 612 fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art also called and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses 613 i give thee charge in the sight of god who quickeneth all things and before christ jesus who before pontius pilate witnessed a good confession 614 that thou keep this commandment without spot unrebukable until the appearing of our lord jesus christ 615 which in his times he shall shew who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and lord of lords 616 who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honour and power everlasting amen 617 charge them that are rich in this world that they be not highminded nor trust in uncertain riches but in the living god who giveth us richly all things to enjoy 618 that they do good that they be rich in good works ready to distribute willing to communicate 619 laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life 620 o timothy keep that which is committed to thy trust avoiding profane and vain babblings and oppositions of science falsely so called 621 which some professing have erred concerning the faith grace be with thee amen the second epistle of paul the apostle to timothy 11 paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god according to the promise of life which is in christ jesus 12 to timothy my dearly beloved son grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord 13 i thank god whom i serve from my forefathers with pure conscience that without ceasing i have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day 14 greatly desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that i may be filled with joy 15 when i call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i am persuaded that in thee also 16 wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting on of my hands 17 for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind 18 be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god 19 who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began 110 but is now made manifest by the appearing of our saviour jesus christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel 111 whereunto i am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles 112 for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day 113 hold fast the form of sound words which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in christ jesus 114 that good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the holy ghost which dwelleth in us 115 this thou knowest that all they which are in asia be turned away from me of whom are phygellus and hermogenes 116 the lord give mercy unto the house of onesiphorus for he oft refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain 117 but when he was in rome he sought me out very diligently and found me 118 the lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the lord in that day and in how many things he ministered unto me at ephesus thou knowest very well 21 thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus 22 and the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also 23 thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ 24 no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier 25 and if a man also strive for masteries yet is he not crowned except he strive lawfully 26 the husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits 27 consider what i say and the lord give thee understanding in all things 28 remember that jesus christ of the seed of david was raised from the dead according to my gospel 29 wherein i suffer trouble as an evil doer even unto bonds but the word of god is not bound 210 therefore i endure all things for the elects sakes that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory 211 it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him 212 if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he also will deny us 213 if we believe not yet he abideth faithful he cannot deny himself 214 of these things put them in remembrance charging them before the lord that they strive not about words to no profit but to the subverting of the hearers 215 study to shew thyself approved unto god a workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth 216 but shun profane and vain babblings for they will increase unto more ungodliness 217 and their word will eat as doth a canker of whom is hymenaeus and philetus 218 who concerning the truth have erred saying that the resurrection is past already and overthrow the faith of some 219 nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them that are his and let every one that nameth the name of christ depart from iniquity 220 but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver but also of wood and of earth and some to honour and some to dishonour 221 if a man therefore purge himself from these he shall be a vessel unto honour sanctified and meet for the masters use and prepared unto every good work 222 flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart 223 but foolish and unlearned questions avoid knowing that they do gender strifes 224 and the servant of the lord must not strive but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient 225 in meekness instructing those that oppose themselves if god peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth 226 and that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his will 31 this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come 32 for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy 33 without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good 34 traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god 35 having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away 36 for of this sort are they which creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts 37 ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth 38 now as jannes and jambres withstood moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds reprobate concerning the faith 39 but they shall proceed no further for their folly shall be manifest unto all men as theirs also was 310 but thou hast fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith longsuffering charity patience 311 persecutions afflictions which came unto me at antioch at iconium at lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me 312 yea and all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution 313 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived 314 but continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them 315 and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in christ jesus 316 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness 317 that the man of god may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good works 41 i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom 42 preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine 43 for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears 44 and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables 45 but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry 46 for i am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand 47 i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith 48 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing 49 do thy diligence to come shortly unto me 410 for demas hath forsaken me having loved this present world and is departed unto thessalonica crescens to galatia titus unto dalmatia 411 only luke is with me take mark and bring him with thee for he is profitable to me for the ministry 412 and tychicus have i sent to ephesus 413 the cloke that i left at troas with carpus when thou comest bring with thee and the books but especially the parchments 414 alexander the coppersmith did me much evil the lord reward him according to his works 415 of whom be thou ware also for he hath greatly withstood our words 416 at my first answer no man stood with me but all men forsook me i pray god that it may not be laid to their charge 417 notwithstanding the lord stood with me and strengthened me that by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the gentiles might hear and i was delivered out of the mouth of the lion 418 and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen 419 salute prisca and aquila and the household of onesiphorus 420 erastus abode at corinth but trophimus have i left at miletum sick 421 do thy diligence to come before winter eubulus greeteth thee and pudens and linus and claudia and all the brethren 422 the lord jesus christ be with thy spirit grace be with you amen the epistle of paul the apostle to titus 11 paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ according to the faith of gods elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness 12 in hope of eternal life which god that cannot lie promised before the world began 13 but hath in due times manifested his word through preaching which is committed unto me according to the commandment of god our saviour 14 to titus mine own son after the common faith grace mercy and peace from god the father and the lord jesus christ our saviour 15 for this cause left i thee in crete that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as i had appointed thee 16 if any be blameless the husband of one wife having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly 17 for a bishop must be blameless as the steward of god not selfwilled not soon angry not given to wine no striker not given to filthy lucre 18 but a lover of hospitality a lover of good men sober just holy temperate 19 holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers 110 for there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers specially they of the circumcision 111 whose mouths must be stopped who subvert whole houses teaching things which they ought not for filthy lucres sake 112 one of themselves even a prophet of their own said the cretians are alway liars evil beasts slow bellies 113 this witness is true wherefore rebuke them sharply that they may be sound in the faith 114 not giving heed to jewish fables and commandments of men that turn from the truth 115 unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled 116 they profess that they know god but in works they deny him being abominable and disobedient and unto every good work reprobate 21 but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine 22 that the aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity in patience 23 the aged women likewise that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things 24 that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children 25 to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed 26 young men likewise exhort to be sober minded 27 in all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works in doctrine shewing uncorruptness gravity sincerity 28 sound speech that cannot be condemned that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed having no evil thing to say of you 29 exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters and to please them well in all things not answering again 210 not purloining but shewing all good fidelity that they may adorn the doctrine of god our saviour in all things 211 for the grace of god that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men 212 teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world 213 looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ 214 who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works 215 these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise thee 31 put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to be ready to every good work 32 to speak evil of no man to be no brawlers but gentle shewing all meekness unto all men 33 for we ourselves also were sometimes foolish disobedient deceived serving divers lusts and pleasures living in malice and envy hateful and hating one another 34 but after that the kindness and love of god our saviour toward man appeared 35 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost 36 which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our saviour 37 that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life 38 this is a faithful saying and these things i will that thou affirm constantly that they which have believed in god might be careful to maintain good works these things are good and profitable unto men 39 but avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and strivings about the law for they are unprofitable and vain 310 a man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject 311 knowing that he that is such is subverted and sinneth being condemned of himself 312 when i shall send artemas unto thee or tychicus be diligent to come unto me to nicopolis for i have determined there to winter 313 bring zenas the lawyer and apollos on their journey diligently that nothing be wanting unto them 314 and let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses that they be not unfruitful 315 all that are with me salute thee greet them that love us in the faith grace be with you all amen the epistle of paul the apostle to philemon 11 paul a prisoner of jesus christ and timothy our brother unto philemon our dearly beloved and fellowlabourer 12 and to our beloved apphia and archippus our fellowsoldier and to the church in thy house 13 grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ 14 i thank my god making mention of thee always in my prayers 15 hearing of thy love and faith which thou hast toward the lord jesus and toward all saints 16 that the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in christ jesus 17 for we have great joy and consolation in thy love because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee brother 18 wherefore though i might be much bold in christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient 19 yet for loves sake i rather beseech thee being such an one as paul the aged and now also a prisoner of jesus christ 110 i beseech thee for my son onesimus whom i have begotten in my bonds 111 which in time past was to thee unprofitable but now profitable to thee and to me 112 whom i have sent again thou therefore receive him that is mine own bowels 113 whom i would have retained with me that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel 114 but without thy mind would i do nothing that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity but willingly 115 for perhaps he therefore departed for a season that thou shouldest receive him for ever 116 not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved specially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the lord 117 if thou count me therefore a partner receive him as myself 118 if he hath wronged thee or oweth thee ought put that on mine account 119 i paul have written it with mine own hand i will repay it albeit i do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides 120 yea brother let me have joy of thee in the lord refresh my bowels in the lord 121 having confidence in thy obedience i wrote unto thee knowing that thou wilt also do more than i say 122 but withal prepare me also a lodging for i trust that through your prayers i shall be given unto you 123 there salute thee epaphras my fellowprisoner in christ jesus 124 marcus aristarchus demas lucas my fellowlabourers 125 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit amen the epistle of paul the apostle to the hebrews 11 god who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets 12 hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things by whom also he made the worlds 13 who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high 14 being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they 15 for unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son this day have i begotten thee and again i will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son 16 and again when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world he saith and let all the angels of god worship him 17 and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire 18 but unto the son he saith thy throne o god is for ever and ever a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom 19 thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity therefore god even thy god hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows 110 and thou lord in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the works of thine hands 111 they shall perish but thou remainest and they all shall wax old as doth a garment 112 and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up and they shall be changed but thou art the same and thy years shall not fail 113 but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool 114 are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation 21 therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard lest at any time we should let them slip 22 for if the word spoken by angels was stedfast and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward 23 how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him 24 god also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy ghost according to his own will 25 for unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come whereof we speak 26 but one in a certain place testified saying what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou visitest him 27 thou madest him a little lower than the angels thou crownedst him with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands 28 thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him 29 but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man 210 for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings 211 for both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren 212 saying i will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will i sing praise unto thee 213 and again i will put my trust in him and again behold i and the children which god hath given me 214 forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil 215 and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage 216 for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham 217 wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to god to make reconciliation for the sins of the people 218 for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to succour them that are tempted 31 wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus 32 who was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses was faithful in all his house 33 for this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house 34 for every house is builded by some man but he that built all things is god 35 and moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after 36 but christ as a son over his own house whose house are we if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end 37 wherefore as the holy ghost saith to day if ye will hear his voice 38 harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the wilderness 39 when your fathers tempted me proved me and saw my works forty years 310 wherefore i was grieved with that generation and said they do alway err in their heart and they have not known my ways 311 so i sware in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest 312 take heed brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living god 313 but exhort one another daily while it is called to day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin 314 for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end 315 while it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts as in the provocation 316 for some when they had heard did provoke howbeit not all that came out of egypt by moses 317 but with whom was he grieved forty years was it not with them that had sinned whose carcases fell in the wilderness 318 and to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest but to them that believed not 319 so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief 41 let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it 42 for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it 43 for we which have believed do enter into rest as he said as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world 44 for he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works 45 and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest 46 seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief 47 again he limiteth a certain day saying in david to day after so long a time as it is said to day if ye will hear his voice harden not your hearts 48 for if jesus had given them rest then would he not afterward have spoken of another day 49 there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of god 410 for he that is entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as god did from his 411 let us labour therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief 412 for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any twoedged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart 413 neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do 414 seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession 415 for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin 416 let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need 51 for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins 52 who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity 53 and by reason hereof he ought as for the people so also for himself to offer for sins 54 and no man taketh this honour unto himself but he that is called of god as was aaron 55 so also christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son to day have i begotten thee 56 as he saith also in another place thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec 57 who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was heard in that he feared 58 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered 59 and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him 510 called of god an high priest after the order of melchisedec 511 of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing 512 for when for the time ye ought to be teachers ye have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat 513 for every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe 514 but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil 61 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god 62 of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment 63 and this will we do if god permit 64 for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost 65 and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come 66 if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucify to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame 67 for the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from god 68 but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned 69 but beloved we are persuaded better things of you and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak 610 for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love which ye have shewed toward his name in that ye have ministered to the saints and do minister 611 and we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end 612 that ye be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises 613 for when god made promise to abraham because he could swear by no greater he sware by himself 614 saying surely blessing i will bless thee and multiplying i will multiply thee 615 and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise 616 for men verily swear by the greater and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife 617 wherein god willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed it by an oath 618 that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us 619 which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and stedfast and which entereth into that within the veil 620 whither the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made an high priest for ever after the order of melchisedec 71 for this melchisedec king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him 72 to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace 73 without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually 74 now consider how great this man was unto whom even the patriarch abraham gave the tenth of the spoils 75 and verily they that are of the sons of levi who receive the office of the priesthood have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law that is of their brethren though they come out of the loins of abraham 76 but he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of abraham and blessed him that had the promises 77 and without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better 78 and here men that die receive tithes but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth 79 and as i may so say levi also who receiveth tithes payed tithes in abraham 710 for he was yet in the loins of his father when melchisedec met him 711 if therefore perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of melchisedec and not be called after the order of aaron 712 for the priesthood being changed there is made of necessity a change also of the law 713 for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar 714 for it is evident that our lord sprang out of juda of which tribe moses spake nothing concerning priesthood 715 and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of melchisedec there ariseth another priest 716 who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life 717 for he testifieth thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec 718 for there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof 719 for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto god 720 and inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest 721 for those priests were made without an oath but this with an oath by him that said unto him the lord sware and will not repent thou art a priest for ever after the order of melchisedec 722 by so much was jesus made a surety of a better testament 723 and they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death 724 but this man because he continueth ever hath an unchangeable priesthood 725 wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto god by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them 726 for such an high priest became us who is holy harmless undefiled separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens 727 who needeth not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself 728 for the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated for evermore 81 now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the throne of the majesty in the heavens 82 a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the lord pitched and not man 83 for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer 84 for if he were on earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law 85 who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount 86 but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which was established upon better promises 87 for if that first covenant had been faultless then should no place have been sought for the second 88 for finding fault with them he saith behold the days come saith the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah 89 not according to the covenant that i made with their fathers in the day when i took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of egypt because they continued not in my covenant and i regarded them not saith the lord 810 for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and i will be to them a god and they shall be to me a people 811 and they shall not teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the least to the greatest 812 for i will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and their iniquities will i remember no more 813 in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away 91 then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary 92 for there was a tabernacle made the first wherein was the candlestick and the table and the shewbread which is called the sanctuary 93 and after the second veil the tabernacle which is called the holiest of all 94 which had the golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold wherein was the golden pot that had manna and aarons rod that budded and the tables of the covenant 95 and over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat of which we cannot now speak particularly 96 now when these things were thus ordained the priests went always into the first tabernacle accomplishing the service of god 97 but into the second went the high priest alone once every year not without blood which he offered for himself and for the errors of the people 98 the holy ghost this signifying that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first tabernacle was yet standing 99 which was a figure for the time then present in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience 910 which stood only in meats and drinks and divers washings and carnal ordinances imposed on them until the time of reformation 911 but christ being come an high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building 912 neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us 913 for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh 914 how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god 915 and for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance 916 for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator 917 for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth 918 whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood 919 for when moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law he took the blood of calves and of goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book and all the people 920 saying this is the blood of the testament which god hath enjoined unto you 921 moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry 922 and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission 923 it was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these 924 for christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of god for us 925 nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others 926 for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself 927 and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the judgment 928 so christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation 101 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect 102 for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins 103 but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year 104 for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins 105 wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me 106 in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure 107 then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o god 108 above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou wouldest not neither hadst pleasure therein which are offered by the law 109 then said he lo i come to do thy will o god he taketh away the first that he may establish the second 1010 by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once for all 1011 and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins 1012 but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever sat down on the right hand of god 1013 from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool 1014 for by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified 1015 whereof the holy ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before 1016 this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them 1017 and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more 1018 now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin 1019 having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus 1020 by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh 1021 and having an high priest over the house of god 1022 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water 1023 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised 1024 and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works 1025 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the day approaching 1026 for if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins 1027 but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries 1028 he that despised moses law died without mercy under two or three witnesses 1029 of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace 1030 for we know him that hath said vengeance belongeth unto me i will recompense saith the lord and again the lord shall judge his people 1031 it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living god 1032 but call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions 1033 partly whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used 1034 for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance 1035 cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompence of reward 1036 for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god ye might receive the promise 1037 for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry 1038 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him 1039 but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul 111 now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen 112 for by it the elders obtained a good report 113 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear 114 by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh 115 by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god 116 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him 117 by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith 118 by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whither he went 119 by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise 1110 for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god 1111 through faith also sara herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised 1112 therefore sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable 1113 these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth 1114 for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country 1115 and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned 1116 but now they desire a better country that is an heavenly wherefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he hath prepared for them a city 1117 by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son 1118 of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called 1119 accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure 1120 by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau concerning things to come 1121 by faith jacob when he was a dying blessed both the sons of joseph and worshipped leaning upon the top of his staff 1122 by faith joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of israel and gave commandment concerning his bones 1123 by faith moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the kings commandment 1124 by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter 1125 choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season 1126 esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward 1127 by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible 1128 through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them 1129 by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land which the egyptians assaying to do were drowned 1130 by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days 1131 by faith the harlot rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace 1132 and what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of gedeon and of barak and of samson and of jephthae of david also and samuel and of the prophets 1133 who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions 1134 quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turned to flight the armies of the aliens 1135 women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection 1136 and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings yea moreover of bonds and imprisonment 1137 they were stoned they were sawn asunder were tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins being destitute afflicted tormented 1138 of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth 1139 and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise 1140 god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect 121 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us 122 looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god 123 for consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds 124 ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin 125 and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him 126 for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth 127 if ye endure chastening god dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not 128 but if ye be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are ye bastards and not sons 129 furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live 1210 for they verily for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his holiness 1211 now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby 1212 wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees 1213 and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it rather be healed 1214 follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord 1215 looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled 1216 lest there be any fornicator or profane person as esau who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright 1217 for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears 1218 for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest 1219 and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more 1220 for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart 1221 and so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake 1222 but ye are come unto mount sion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels 1223 to the general assembly and church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect 1224 and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel 1225 see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven 1226 whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven 1227 and this word yet once more signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain 1228 wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear 1229 for our god is a consuming fire 131 let brotherly love continue 132 be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares 133 remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body 134 marriage is honourable in all and the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers god will judge 135 let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee 136 so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me 137 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of god whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation 138 jesus christ the same yesterday and to day and for ever 139 be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein 1310 we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle 1311 for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp 1312 wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate 1313 let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach 1314 for here have we no continuing city but we seek one to come 1315 by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name 1316 but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacrifices god is well pleased 1317 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you 1318 pray for us for we trust we have a good conscience in all things willing to live honestly 1319 but i beseech you the rather to do this that i may be restored to you the sooner 1320 now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord jesus that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant 1321 make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be glory for ever and ever amen 1322 and i beseech you brethren suffer the word of exhortation for i have written a letter unto you in few words 1323 know ye that our brother timothy is set at liberty with whom if he come shortly i will see you 1324 salute all them that have the rule over you and all the saints they of italy salute you 1325 grace be with you all amen the general epistle of james 11 james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad greeting 12 my brethren count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations 13 knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience 14 but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing 15 if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him 16 but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed 17 for let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the lord 18 a double minded man is unstable in all his ways 19 let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted 110 but the rich in that he is made low because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away 111 for the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat but it withereth the grass and the flower thereof falleth and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways 112 blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him 113 let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man 114 but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed 115 then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death 116 do not err my beloved brethren 117 every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning 118 of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures 119 wherefore my beloved brethren let every man be swift to hear slow to speak slow to wrath 120 for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god 121 wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls 122 but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves 123 for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass 124 for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was 125 but whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty and continueth therein he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed 126 if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart this mans religion is vain 127 pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world 21 my brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ the lord of glory with respect of persons 22 for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring in goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment 23 and ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing and say unto him sit thou here in a good place and say to the poor stand thou there or sit here under my footstool 24 are ye not then partial in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts 25 hearken my beloved brethren hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him 26 but ye have despised the poor do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats 27 do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called 28 if ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself ye do well 29 but if ye have respect to persons ye commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors 210 for whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point he is guilty of all 211 for he that said do not commit adultery said also do not kill now if thou commit no adultery yet if thou kill thou art become a transgressor of the law 212 so speak ye and so do as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty 213 for he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shewed no mercy and mercy rejoiceth against judgment 214 what doth it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can faith save him 215 if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food 216 and one of you say unto them depart in peace be ye warmed and filled notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body what doth it profit 217 even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone 218 yea a man may say thou hast faith and i have works shew me thy faith without thy works and i will shew thee my faith by my works 219 thou believest that there is one god thou doest well the devils also believe and tremble 220 but wilt thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead 221 was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar 222 seest thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect 223 and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god 224 ye see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only 225 likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way 226 for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also 31 my brethren be not many masters knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation 32 for in many things we offend all if any man offend not in word the same is a perfect man and able also to bridle the whole body 33 behold we put bits in the horses mouths that they may obey us and we turn about their whole body 34 behold also the ships which though they be so great and are driven of fierce winds yet are they turned about with a very small helm whithersoever the governor listeth 35 even so the tongue is a little member and boasteth great things behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth 36 and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body and setteth on fire the course of nature and it is set on fire of hell 37 for every kind of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of things in the sea is tamed and hath been tamed of mankind 38 but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison 39 therewith bless we god even the father and therewith curse we men which are made after the similitude of god 310 out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be 311 doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter 312 can the fig tree my brethren bear olive berries either a vine figs so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh 313 who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom 314 but if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth 315 this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish 316 for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work 317 but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be intreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy 318 and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace 41 from whence come wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members 42 ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and war yet ye have not because ye ask not 43 ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts 44 ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god 45 do ye think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy 46 but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace unto the humble 47 submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you 48 draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded 49 be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness 410 humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up 411 speak not evil one of another brethren he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judge 412 there is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy who art thou that judgest another 413 go to now ye that say to day or to morrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain 414 whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow for what is your life it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time and then vanisheth away 415 for that ye ought to say if the lord will we shall live and do this or that 416 but now ye rejoice in your boastings all such rejoicing is evil 417 therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin 51 go to now ye rich men weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you 52 your riches are corrupted and your garments are motheaten 53 your gold and silver is cankered and the rust of them shall be a witness against you and shall eat your flesh as it were fire ye have heaped treasure together for the last days 54 behold the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields which is of you kept back by fraud crieth and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the lord of sabaoth 55 ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton ye have nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter 56 ye have condemned and killed the just and he doth not resist you 57 be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he receive the early and latter rain 58 be ye also patient stablish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nigh 59 grudge not one against another brethren lest ye be condemned behold the judge standeth before the door 510 take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience 511 behold we count them happy which endure ye have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord that the lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy 512 but above all things my brethren swear not neither by heaven neither by the earth neither by any other oath but let your yea be yea and your nay nay lest ye fall into condemnation 513 is any among you afflicted let him pray is any merry let him sing psalms 514 is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord 515 and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him 516 confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much 517 elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months 518 and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit 519 brethren if any of you do err from the truth and one convert him 520 let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins the first epistle general of peter 11 peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia 12 elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied 13 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead 14 to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you 15 who are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time 16 wherein ye greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations 17 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of jesus christ 18 whom having not seen ye love in whom though now ye see him not yet believing ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory 19 receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls 110 of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you 111 searching what or what manner of time the spirit of christ which was in them did signify when it testified beforehand the sufferings of christ and the glory that should follow 112 unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost sent down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into 113 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ 114 as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance 115 but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation 116 because it is written be ye holy for i am holy 117 and if ye call on the father who without respect of persons judgeth according to every mans work pass the time of your sojourning here in fear 118 forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers 119 but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot 120 who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you 121 who by him do believe in god that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in god 122 seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently 123 being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the word of god which liveth and abideth for ever 124 for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof falleth away 125 but the word of the lord endureth for ever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you 21 wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies all evil speakings 22 as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby 23 if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious 24 to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious 25 ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house an holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ 26 wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold i lay in sion a chief corner stone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded 27 unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner 28 and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed 29 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood an holy nation a peculiar people that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light 210 which in time past were not a people but are now the people of god which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy 211 dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul 212 having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evildoers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation 213 submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lords sake whether it be to the king as supreme 214 or unto governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well 215 for so is the will of god that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men 216 as free and not using your liberty for a cloke of maliciousness but as the servants of god 217 honour all men love the brotherhood fear god honour the king 218 servants be subject to your masters with all fear not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward 219 for this is thankworthy if a man for conscience toward god endure grief suffering wrongfully 220 for what glory is it if when ye be buffeted for your faults ye shall take it patiently but if when ye do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with god 221 for even hereunto were ye called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps 222 who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth 223 who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously 224 who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye were healed 225 for ye were as sheep going astray but are now returned unto the shepherd and bishop of your souls 31 likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives 32 while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear 33 whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel 34 but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price 35 for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in god adorned themselves being in subjection unto their own husbands 36 even as sara obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well and are not afraid with any amazement 37 likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered 38 finally be ye all of one mind having compassion one of another love as brethren be pitiful be courteous 39 not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrariwise blessing knowing that ye are thereunto called that ye should inherit a blessing 310 for he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile 311 let him eschew evil and do good let him seek peace and ensue it 312 for the eyes of the lord are over the righteous and his ears are open unto their prayers but the face of the lord is against them that do evil 313 and who is he that will harm you if ye be followers of that which is good 314 but and if ye suffer for righteousness sake happy are ye and be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled 315 but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear 316 having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as of evildoers they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in christ 317 for it is better if the will of god be so that ye suffer for well doing than for evil doing 318 for christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to god being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit 319 by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison 320 which sometime were disobedient when once the longsuffering of god waited in the days of noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water 321 the like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us not the putting away of the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience toward god by the resurrection of jesus christ 322 who is gone into heaven and is on the right hand of god angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him 41 forasmuch then as christ hath suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin 42 that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god 43 for the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lusts excess of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries 44 wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot speaking evil of you 45 who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead 46 for for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead that they might be judged according to men in the flesh but live according to god in the spirit 47 but the end of all things is at hand be ye therefore sober and watch unto prayer 48 and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins 49 use hospitality one to another without grudging 410 as every man hath received the gift even so minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of god 411 if any man speak let him speak as the oracles of god if any man minister let him do it as of the ability which god giveth that god in all things may be glorified through jesus christ to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever amen 412 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you 413 but rejoice inasmuch as ye are partakers of christs sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy 414 if ye be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of god resteth upon you on their part he is evil spoken of but on your part he is glorified 415 but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other mens matters 416 yet if any man suffer as a christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf 417 for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of god and if it first begin at us what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of god 418 and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear 419 wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of god commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful creator 51 the elders which are among you i exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed 52 feed the flock of god which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucre but of a ready mind 53 neither as being lords over gods heritage but being ensamples to the flock 54 and when the chief shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away 55 likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble 56 humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time 57 casting all your care upon him for he careth for you 58 be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour 59 whom resist stedfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world 510 but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that ye have suffered a while make you perfect stablish strengthen settle you 511 to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever amen 512 by silvanus a faithful brother unto you as i suppose i have written briefly exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of god wherein ye stand 513 the church that is at babylon elected together with you saluteth you and so doth marcus my son 514 greet ye one another with a kiss of charity peace be with you all that are in christ jesus amen the second general epistle of peter 11 simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ 12 grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord 13 according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue 14 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust 15 and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge 16 and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness 17 and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity 18 for if these things be in you and abound they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ 19 but he that lacketh these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins 110 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye do these things ye shall never fall 111 for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ 112 wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth 113 yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance 114 knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ hath shewed me 115 moreover i will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance 116 for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but were eyewitnesses of his majesty 117 for he received from god the father honour and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased 118 and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mount 119 we have also a more sure word of prophecy whereunto ye do well that ye take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts 120 knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation 121 for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost 21 but there were false prophets also among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that bought them and bring upon themselves swift destruction 22 and many shall follow their pernicious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of 23 and through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not and their damnation slumbereth not 24 for if god spared not the angels that sinned but cast them down to hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment 25 and spared not the old world but saved noah the eighth person a preacher of righteousness bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly 26 and turning the cities of sodom and gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly 27 and delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked 28 for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds 29 the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished 210 but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government presumptuous are they selfwilled they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities 211 whereas angels which are greater in power and might bring not railing accusation against them before the lord 212 but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption 213 and shall receive the reward of unrighteousness as they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time spots they are and blemishes sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you 214 having eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls an heart they have exercised with covetous practices cursed children 215 which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balaam the son of bosor who loved the wages of unrighteousness 216 but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking with mans voice forbad the madness of the prophet 217 these are wells without water clouds that are carried with a tempest to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever 218 for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wantonness those that were clean escaped from them who live in error 219 while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome of the same is he brought in bondage 220 for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and saviour jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter end is worse with them than the beginning 221 for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them 222 but it is happened unto them according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his own vomit again and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire 31 this second epistle beloved i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance 32 that ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandment of us the apostles of the lord and saviour 33 knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts 34 and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation 35 for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water 36 whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished 37 but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men 38 but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day 39 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to usward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance 310 but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up 311 seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness 312 looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat 313 nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness 314 wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless 315 and account that the longsuffering of our lord is salvation even as our beloved brother paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you 316 as also in all his epistles speaking in them of these things in which are some things hard to be understood which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest as they do also the other scriptures unto their own destruction 317 ye therefore beloved seeing ye know these things before beware lest ye also being led away with the error of the wicked fall from your own stedfastness 318 but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and saviour jesus christ to him be glory both now and for ever amen the first epistle general of john 11 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life 12 for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and shew unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us 13 that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ 14 and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full 15 this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all 16 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth 17 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin 18 if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us 19 if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness 110 if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us 21 my little children these things write i unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous 22 and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world 23 and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments 24 he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him 25 but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him 26 he that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk even as he walked 27 brethren i write no new commandment unto you but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning the old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning 28 again a new commandment i write unto you which thing is true in him and in you because the darkness is past and the true light now shineth 29 he that saith he is in the light and hateth his brother is in darkness even until now 210 he that loveth his brother abideth in the light and there is none occasion of stumbling in him 211 but he that hateth his brother is in darkness and walketh in darkness and knoweth not whither he goeth because that darkness hath blinded his eyes 212 i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his names sake 213 i write unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning i write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one i write unto you little children because ye have known the father 214 i have written unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning i have written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of god abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one 215 love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him 216 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world 217 and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth for ever 218 little children it is the last time and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time 219 they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us 220 but ye have an unction from the holy one and ye know all things 221 i have not written unto you because ye know not the truth but because ye know it and that no lie is of the truth 222 who is a liar but he that denieth that jesus is the christ he is antichrist that denieth the father and the son 223 whosoever denieth the son the same hath not the father he that acknowledgeth the son hath the father also 224 let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye also shall continue in the son and in the father 225 and this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal life 226 these things have i written unto you concerning them that seduce you 227 but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and ye need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it hath taught you ye shall abide in him 228 and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming 229 if ye know that he is righteous ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him 31 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not 32 beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is 33 and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure 34 whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law 35 and ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin 36 whosoever abideth in him sinneth not whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known him 37 little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous 38 he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil 39 whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god 310 in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother 311 for this is the message that ye heard from the beginning that we should love one another 312 not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous 313 marvel not my brethren if the world hate you 314 we know that we have passed from death unto life because we love the brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death 315 whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him 316 hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren 317 but whoso hath this worlds good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of god in him 318 my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth 319 and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him 320 for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things 321 beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward god 322 and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight 323 and this is his commandment that we should believe on the name of his son jesus christ and love one another as he gave us commandment 324 and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he in him and hereby we know that he abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given us 41 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world 42 hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god 43 and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ is come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world 44 ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world 45 they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them 46 we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us he that is not of god heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error 47 beloved let us love one another for love is of god and every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god 48 he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love 49 in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him 410 herein is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins 411 beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another 412 no man hath seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us 413 hereby know we that we dwell in him and he in us because he hath given us of his spirit 414 and we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the saviour of the world 415 whosoever shall confess that jesus is the son of god god dwelleth in him and he in god 416 and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him 417 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world 418 there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love 419 we love him because he first loved us 420 if a man say i love god and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen 421 and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth god love his brother also 51 whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him 52 by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments 53 for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous 54 for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith 55 who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god 56 this is he that came by water and blood even jesus christ not by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit that beareth witness because the spirit is truth 57 for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one 58 and there are three that bear witness in earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one 59 if we receive the witness of men the witness of god is greater for this is the witness of god which he hath testified of his son 510 he that believeth on the son of god hath the witness in himself he that believeth not god hath made him a liar because he believeth not the record that god gave of his son 511 and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son 512 he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life 513 these things have i written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god 514 and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask any thing according to his will he heareth us 515 and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him 516 if any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death he shall ask and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death there is a sin unto death i do not say that he shall pray for it 517 all unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin not unto death 518 we know that whosoever is born of god sinneth not but he that is begotten of god keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not 519 and we know that we are of god and the whole world lieth in wickedness 520 and we know that the son of god is come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son jesus christ this is the true god and eternal life 521 little children keep yourselves from idols amen the second epistle general of john 11 the elder unto the elect lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not i only but also all they that have known the truth 12 for the truths sake which dwelleth in us and shall be with us for ever 13 grace be with you mercy and peace from god the father and from the lord jesus christ the son of the father in truth and love 14 i rejoiced greatly that i found of thy children walking in truth as we have received a commandment from the father 15 and now i beseech thee lady not as though i wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another 16 and this is love that we walk after his commandments this is the commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walk in it 17 for many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that jesus christ is come in the flesh this is a deceiver and an antichrist 18 look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full reward 19 whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son 110 if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him god speed 111 for he that biddeth him god speed is partaker of his evil deeds 112 having many things to write unto you i would not write with paper and ink but i trust to come unto you and speak face to face that our joy may be full 113 the children of thy elect sister greet thee amen the third epistle general of john 11 the elder unto the wellbeloved gaius whom i love in the truth 12 beloved i wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as thy soul prospereth 13 for i rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth 14 i have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth 15 beloved thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren and to strangers 16 which have borne witness of thy charity before the church whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort thou shalt do well 17 because that for his names sake they went forth taking nothing of the gentiles 18 we therefore ought to receive such that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth 19 i wrote unto the church but diotrephes who loveth to have the preeminence among them receiveth us not 110 wherefore if i come i will remember his deeds which he doeth prating against us with malicious words and not content therewith neither doth he himself receive the brethren and forbiddeth them that would and casteth them out of the church 111 beloved follow not that which is evil but that which is good he that doeth good is of god but he that doeth evil hath not seen god 112 demetrius hath good report of all men and of the truth itself yea and we also bear record and ye know that our record is true 113 i had many things to write but i will not with ink and pen write unto thee 114 but i trust i shall shortly see thee and we shall speak face to face peace be to thee our friends salute thee greet the friends by name the general epistle of jude 11 jude the servant of jesus christ and brother of james to them that are sanctified by god the father and preserved in jesus christ and called 12 mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied 13 beloved when i gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints 14 for there are certain men crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god and our lord jesus christ 15 i will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the lord having saved the people out of the land of egypt afterward destroyed them that believed not 16 and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day 17 even as sodom and gomorrha and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire 18 likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise dominion and speak evil of dignities 19 yet michael the archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of moses durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the lord rebuke thee 110 but these speak evil of those things which they know not but what they know naturally as brute beasts in those things they corrupt themselves 111 woe unto them for they have gone in the way of cain and ran greedily after the error of balaam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of core 112 these are spots in your feasts of charity when they feast with you feeding themselves without fear clouds they are without water carried about of winds trees whose fruit withereth without fruit twice dead plucked up by the roots 113 raging waves of the sea foaming out their own shame wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever 114 and enoch also the seventh from adam prophesied of these saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints 115 to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him 116 these are murmurers complainers walking after their own lusts and their mouth speaketh great swelling words having mens persons in admiration because of advantage 117 but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our lord jesus christ 118 how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lusts 119 these be they who separate themselves sensual having not the spirit 120 but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost 121 keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life 122 and of some have compassion making a difference 123 and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh 124 now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy 125 to the only wise god our saviour be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and ever amen the revelation of saint john the devine 11 the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john 12 who bare record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw 13 blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand 14 john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne 15 and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood 16 and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever amen 17 behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen 18 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty 19 i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the isle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ 110 i was in the spirit on the lords day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet 111 saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in asia unto ephesus and unto smyrna and unto pergamos and unto thyatira and unto sardis and unto philadelphia and unto laodicea 112 and i turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks 113 and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and girt about the paps with a golden girdle 114 his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire 115 and his feet like unto fine brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters 116 and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength 117 and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last 118 i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death 119 write the things which thou hast seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter 120 the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches 21 unto the angel of the church of ephesus write these things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks 22 i know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear them which are evil and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles and are not and hast found them liars 23 and hast borne and hast patience and for my names sake hast laboured and hast not fainted 24 nevertheless i have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love 25 remember therefore from whence thou art fallen and repent and do the first works or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent 26 but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nicolaitanes which i also hate 27 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god 28 and unto the angel of the church in smyrna write these things saith the first and the last which was dead and is alive 29 i know thy works and tribulation and poverty but thou art rich and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogue of satan 210 fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that ye may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life 211 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death 212 and to the angel of the church in pergamos write these things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges 213 i know thy works and where thou dwellest even where satans seat is and thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith even in those days wherein antipas was my faithful martyr who was slain among you where satan dwelleth 214 but i have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication 215 so hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the nicolaitanes which thing i hate 216 repent or else i will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth 217 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it 218 and unto the angel of the church in thyatira write these things saith the son of god who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass 219 i know thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first 220 notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto idols 221 and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not 222 behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds 223 and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reins and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works 224 but unto you i say and unto the rest in thyatira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depths of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden 225 but that which ye have already hold fast till i come 226 and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations 227 and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers even as i received of my father 228 and i will give him the morning star 229 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches 31 and unto the angel of the church in sardis write these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead 32 be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for i have not found thy works perfect before god 33 remember therefore how thou hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon thee 34 thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy 35 he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life but i will confess his name before my father and before his angels 36 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches 37 and to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth 38 i know thy works behold i have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and hast kept my word and hast not denied my name 39 behold i will make them of the synagogue of satan which say they are jews and are not but do lie behold i will make them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that i have loved thee 310 because thou hast kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth 311 behold i come quickly hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown 312 him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and i will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is new jerusalem which cometh down out of heaven from my god and i will write upon him my new name 313 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches 314 and unto the angel of the church of the laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god 315 i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wert cold or hot 316 so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spue thee out of my mouth 317 because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked 318 i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see 319 as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent 320 behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me 321 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne 322 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches 41 after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which i heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and i will shew thee things which must be hereafter 42 and immediately i was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne 43 and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone and there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald 44 and round about the throne were four and twenty seats and upon the seats i saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold 45 and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god 46 and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind 47 and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle 48 and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy lord god almighty which was and is and is to come 49 and when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever 410 the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne saying 411 thou art worthy o lord to receive glory and honour and power for thou hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created 51 and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals 52 and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof 53 and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon 54 and i wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon 55 and one of the elders saith unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of juda the root of david hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof 56 and i beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth 57 and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne 58 and when he had taken the book the four beasts and four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps and golden vials full of odours which are the prayers of saints 59 and they sung a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation 510 and hast made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth 511 and i beheld and i heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands of thousands 512 saying with a loud voice worthy is the lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing 513 and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honour and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever 514 and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever 61 and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see 62 and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer 63 and when he had opened the second seal i heard the second beast say come and see 64 and there went out another horse that was red and power was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword 65 and when he had opened the third seal i heard the third beast say come and see and i beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand 66 and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine 67 and when he had opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see 68 and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth 69 and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held 610 and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth 611 and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellowservants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled 612 and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood 613 and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind 614 and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and island were moved out of their places 615 and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captains and the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains 616 and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb 617 for the great day of his wrath is come and who shall be able to stand 71 and after these things i saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth holding the four winds of the earth that the wind should not blow on the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree 72 and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea 73 saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads 74 and i heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of israel 75 of the tribe of juda were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of reuben were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of gad were sealed twelve thousand 76 of the tribe of aser were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of manasses were sealed twelve thousand 77 of the tribe of simeon were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of levi were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of issachar were sealed twelve thousand 78 of the tribe of zabulon were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of joseph were sealed twelve thousand of the tribe of benjamin were sealed twelve thousand 79 after this i beheld and lo a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb clothed with white robes and palms in their hands 710 and cried with a loud voice saying salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb 711 and all the angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worshipped god 712 saying amen blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and might be unto our god for ever and ever amen 713 and one of the elders answered saying unto me what are these which are arrayed in white robes and whence came they 714 and i said unto him sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they which came out of great tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb 715 therefore are they before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them 716 they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more neither shall the sun light on them nor any heat 717 for the lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes 81 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour 82 and i saw the seven angels which stood before god and to them were given seven trumpets 83 and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne 84 and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the saints ascended up before god out of the angels hand 85 and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake 86 and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound 87 the first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of trees was burnt up and all green grass was burnt up 88 and the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood 89 and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died and the third part of the ships were destroyed 810 and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters 811 and the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter 812 and the fourth angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shone not for a third part of it and the night likewise 813 and i beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels which are yet to sound 91 and the fifth angel sounded and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit 92 and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit 93 and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power as the scorpions of the earth have power 94 and it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of god in their foreheads 95 and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man 96 and in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and death shall flee from them 97 and the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men 98 and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as the teeth of lions 99 and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle 910 and they had tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in their tails and their power was to hurt men five months 911 and they had a king over them which is the angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the hebrew tongue is abaddon but in the greek tongue hath his name apollyon 912 one woe is past and behold there come two woes more hereafter 913 and the sixth angel sounded and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god 914 saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates 915 and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and a day and a month and a year for to slay the third part of men 916 and the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and i heard the number of them 917 and thus i saw the horses in the vision and them that sat on them having breastplates of fire and of jacinth and brimstone and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone 918 by these three was the third part of men killed by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone which issued out of their mouths 919 for their power is in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were like unto serpents and had heads and with them they do hurt 920 and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and of wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk 921 neither repented they of their murders nor of their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts 101 and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire 102 and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth 103 and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices 104 and when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not 105 and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven 106 and sware by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer 107 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets 108 and the voice which i heard from heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth 109 and i went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey 1010 and i took the little book out of the angels hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter 1011 and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings 111 and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of god and the altar and them that worship therein 112 but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months 113 and i will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days clothed in sackcloth 114 these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth 115 and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed 116 these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will 117 and when they shall have finished their testimony the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them 118 and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called sodom and egypt where also our lord was crucified 119 and they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves 1110 and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth 1111 and after three days and an half the spirit of life from god entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them 1112 and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them 1113 and the same hour was there a great earthquake and the tenth part of the city fell and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand and the remnant were affrighted and gave glory to the god of heaven 1114 the second woe is past and behold the third woe cometh quickly 1115 and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign for ever and ever 1116 and the four and twenty elders which sat before god on their seats fell upon their faces and worshipped god 1117 saying we give thee thanks o lord god almighty which art and wast and art to come because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned 1118 and the nations were angry and thy wrath is come and the time of the dead that they should be judged and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets and to the saints and them that fear thy name small and great and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth 1119 and the temple of god was opened in heaven and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament and there were lightnings and voices and thunderings and an earthquake and great hail 121 and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars 122 and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered 123 and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads 124 and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born 125 and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to his throne 126 and the woman fled into the wilderness where she hath a place prepared of god that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days 127 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels 128 and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven 129 and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him 1210 and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our god day and night 1211 and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death 1212 therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time 1213 and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child 1214 and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent 1215 and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood 1216 and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth 1217 and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ 131 and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy 132 and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority 133 and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the beast 134 and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him 135 and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months 136 and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven 137 and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations 138 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world 139 if any man have an ear let him hear 1310 he that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the saints 1311 and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon 1312 and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed 1313 and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men 1314 and deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live 1315 and he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed 1316 and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads 1317 and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name 1318 here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six 141 and i looked and lo a lamb stood on the mount sion and with him an hundred forty and four thousand having his fathers name written in their foreheads 142 and i heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder and i heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps 143 and they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth 144 these are they which were not defiled with women for they are virgins these are they which follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth these were redeemed from among men being the firstfruits unto god and to the lamb 145 and in their mouth was found no guile for they are without fault before the throne of god 146 and i saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth and to every nation and kindred and tongue and people 147 saying with a loud voice fear god and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of waters 148 and there followed another angel saying babylon is fallen is fallen that great city because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication 149 and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand 1410 the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb 1411 and the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the beast and his image and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name 1412 here is the patience of the saints here are they that keep the commandments of god and the faith of jesus 1413 and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me write blessed are the dead which die in the lord from henceforth yea saith the spirit that they may rest from their labours and their works do follow them 1414 and i looked and behold a white cloud and upon the cloud one sat like unto the son of man having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle 1415 and another angel came out of the temple crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud thrust in thy sickle and reap for the time is come for thee to reap for the harvest of the earth is ripe 1416 and he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth and the earth was reaped 1417 and another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven he also having a sharp sickle 1418 and another angel came out from the altar which had power over fire and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle saying thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe 1419 and the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of god 1420 and the winepress was trodden without the city and blood came out of the winepress even unto the horse bridles by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs 151 and i saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up the wrath of god 152 and i saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and them that had gotten the victory over the beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand on the sea of glass having the harps of god 153 and they sing the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb saying great and marvellous are thy works lord god almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints 154 who shall not fear thee o lord and glorify thy name for thou only art holy for all nations shall come and worship before thee for thy judgments are made manifest 155 and after that i looked and behold the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened 156 and the seven angels came out of the temple having the seven plagues clothed in pure and white linen and having their breasts girded with golden girdles 157 and one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of god who liveth for ever and ever 158 and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power and no man was able to enter into the temple till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled 161 and i heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels go your ways and pour out the vials of the wrath of god upon the earth 162 and the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast and upon them which worshipped his image 163 and the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea and it became as the blood of a dead man and every living soul died in the sea 164 and the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters and they became blood 165 and i heard the angel of the waters say thou art righteous o lord which art and wast and shalt be because thou hast judged thus 166 for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink for they are worthy 167 and i heard another out of the altar say even so lord god almighty true and righteous are thy judgments 168 and the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire 169 and men were scorched with great heat and blasphemed the name of god which hath power over these plagues and they repented not to give him glory 1610 and the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast and his kingdom was full of darkness and they gnawed their tongues for pain 1611 and blasphemed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores and repented not of their deeds 1612 and the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates and the water thereof was dried up that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared 1613 and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet 1614 for they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty 1615 behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame 1616 and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon 1617 and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done 1618 and there were voices and thunders and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake and so great 1619 and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and great babylon came in remembrance before god to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath 1620 and every island fled away and the mountains were not found 1621 and there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven every stone about the weight of a talent and men blasphemed god because of the plague of the hail for the plague thereof was exceeding great 171 and there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials and talked with me saying unto me come hither i will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters 172 with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication 173 so he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness and i saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns 174 and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication 175 and upon her forehead was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth 176 and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus and when i saw her i wondered with great admiration 177 and the angel said unto me wherefore didst thou marvel i will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carrieth her which hath the seven heads and ten horns 178 the beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the beast that was and is not and yet is 179 and here is the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth 1710 and there are seven kings five are fallen and one is and the other is not yet come and when he cometh he must continue a short space 1711 and the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and is of the seven and goeth into perdition 1712 and the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings which have received no kingdom as yet but receive power as kings one hour with the beast 1713 these have one mind and shall give their power and strength unto the beast 1714 these shall make war with the lamb and the lamb shall overcome them for he is lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him are called and chosen and faithful 1715 and he saith unto me the waters which thou sawest where the whore sitteth are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues 1716 and the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast these shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire 1717 for god hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will and to agree and give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of god shall be fulfilled 1718 and the woman which thou sawest is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth 181 and after these things i saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory 182 and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying babylon the great is fallen is fallen and is become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird 183 for all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies 184 and i heard another voice from heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that ye receive not of her plagues 185 for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities 186 reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double 187 how much she hath glorified herself and lived deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart i sit a queen and am no widow and shall see no sorrow 188 therefore shall her plagues come in one day death and mourning and famine and she shall be utterly burned with fire for strong is the lord god who judgeth her 189 and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning 1810 standing afar off for the fear of her torment saying alas alas that great city babylon that mighty city for in one hour is thy judgment come 1811 and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth their merchandise any more 1812 the merchandise of gold and silver and precious stones and of pearls and fine linen and purple and silk and scarlet and all thyine wood and all manner vessels of ivory and all manner vessels of most precious wood and of brass and iron and marble 1813 and cinnamon and odours and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and beasts and sheep and horses and chariots and slaves and souls of men 1814 and the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee and thou shalt find them no more at all 1815 the merchants of these things which were made rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing 1816 and saying alas alas that great city that was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls 1817 for in one hour so great riches is come to nought and every shipmaster and all the company in ships and sailors and as many as trade by sea stood afar off 1818 and cried when they saw the smoke of her burning saying what city is like unto this great city 1819 and they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wailing saying alas alas that great city wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness for in one hour is she made desolate 1820 rejoice over her thou heaven and ye holy apostles and prophets for god hath avenged you on her 1821 and a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea saying thus with violence shall that great city babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all 1822 and the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and trumpeters shall be heard no more at all in thee and no craftsman of whatsoever craft he be shall be found any more in thee and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee 1823 and the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee for thy merchants were the great men of the earth for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived 1824 and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth 191 and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven saying alleluia salvation and glory and honour and power unto the lord our god 192 for true and righteous are his judgments for he hath judged the great whore which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand 193 and again they said alleluia and her smoke rose up for ever and ever 194 and the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshipped god that sat on the throne saying amen alleluia 195 and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our god all ye his servants and ye that fear him both small and great 196 and i heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings saying alleluia for the lord god omnipotent reigneth 197 let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready 198 and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints 199 and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of god 1910 and i fell at his feet to worship him and he said unto me see thou do it not i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren that have the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy 1911 and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war 1912 his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself 1913 and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god 1914 and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean 1915 and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of almighty god 1916 and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and lord of lords 1917 and i saw an angel standing in the sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great god 1918 that ye may eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of captains and the flesh of mighty men and the flesh of horses and of them that sit on them and the flesh of all men both free and bond both small and great 1919 and i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army 1920 and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone 1921 and the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse which sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowls were filled with their flesh 201 and i saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand 202 and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and satan and bound him a thousand years 203 and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season 204 and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years 205 but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection 206 blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years 207 and when the thousand years are expired satan shall be loosed out of his prison 208 and shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth gog and magog to gather them together to battle the number of whom is as the sand of the sea 209 and they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about and the beloved city and fire came down from god out of heaven and devoured them 2010 and the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone where the beast and the false prophet are and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever 2011 and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them 2012 and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works 2013 and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works 2014 and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death 2015 and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire 211 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there was no more sea 212 and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband 213 and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god 214 and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away 215 and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful 216 and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely 217 he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son 218 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death 219 and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither i will shew thee the bride the lambs wife 2110 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and shewed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god 2111 having the glory of god and her light was like unto a stone most precious even like a jasper stone clear as crystal 2112 and had a wall great and high and had twelve gates and at the gates twelve angels and names written thereon which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of israel 2113 on the east three gates on the north three gates on the south three gates and on the west three gates 2114 and the wall of the city had twelve foundations and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb 2115 and he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and the gates thereof and the wall thereof 2116 and the city lieth foursquare and the length is as large as the breadth and he measured the city with the reed twelve thousand furlongs the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal 2117 and he measured the wall thereof an hundred and forty and four cubits according to the measure of a man that is of the angel 2118 and the building of the wall of it was of jasper and the city was pure gold like unto clear glass 2119 and the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones the first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third a chalcedony the fourth an emerald 2120 the fifth sardonyx the sixth sardius the seventh chrysolyte the eighth beryl the ninth a topaz the tenth a chrysoprasus the eleventh a jacinth the twelfth an amethyst 2121 and the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass 2122 and i saw no temple therein for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple of it 2123 and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof 2124 and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it 2125 and the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day for there shall be no night there 2126 and they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it 2127 and there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither whatsoever worketh abomination or maketh a lie but they which are written in the lambs book of life 221 and he shewed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb 222 in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations 223 and there shall be no more curse but the throne of god and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him 224 and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads 225 and there shall be no night there and they need no candle neither light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they shall reign for ever and ever 226 and he said unto me these sayings are faithful and true and the lord god of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done 227 behold i come quickly blessed is he that keepeth the sayings of the prophecy of this book 228 and i john saw these things and heard them and when i had heard and seen i fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which shewed me these things 229 then saith he unto me see thou do it not for i am thy fellowservant and of thy brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship god 2210 and he saith unto me seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book for the time is at hand 2211 he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still 2212 and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be 2213 i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last 2214 blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city 2215 for without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie 2216 i jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright and morning star 2217 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely 2218 for i testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book if any man shall add unto these things god shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book 2219 and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy god shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book 2220 he which testifieth these things saith surely i come quickly amen even so come lord jesus 2221 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen end of the project gutenberg ebook of the king james bible  end of this
